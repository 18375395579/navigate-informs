<br>Title: Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Sequencing</br><br>Author: Hongmei Jiang, Northwestern University, 2006 Sheridan Road, Wilmette, IL, 60208, United States of America, hongmei@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lingling An</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In the past few years, the number of metagenomic projects in natural (such as soil and water) or host-associated (such as human gut and oral cavity) environments has grown exponentially.  Based on the short reads sequencing data, we propose a mixture model to characterize the taxonomic composition of a metagenomic sample. The method is comprehensively tested on both simulated and real data, and is able to accurately identify and quantify multiple genomes.</br>
