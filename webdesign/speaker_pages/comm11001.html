<br>Title: A Risk Analysis Study of the Negative Pressure Test in Oil and Gas Drilling</br><br>Author: Maryam Tabibzadeh, Ms., University of Southern California, 1157 W., 30th St., Los Angeles, CA, 90007, United States of America, m.tabibzadeh@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Najmedin Meshkati</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian network modeling as a major part of a risk assessment framework for analysis of the Negative Pressure Test (NPT), which is a critical step in well integrity during offshore drilling. This framework focuses on the critical role of human and organizational factors in conducting and interpreting NPT. Although this study is based on the analyses and lessons learned from the BP Deepwater Horizon accident, it is applicable for risk analysis of future drillings as well.</br>
