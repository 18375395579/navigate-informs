In this talk we present effective resource management strategies to reduce this energy consumption. We take advantage of the fact that user requests vary tremendously both spatially and temporally. Using a statistical model to predict user-request patterns and a queueing model for performance measures, we formulate and solve an optimization problem for resource management.</br>
