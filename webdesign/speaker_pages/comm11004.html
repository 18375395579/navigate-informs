<br>Title: Determination of the Onset and Duration of Contraflow Operations under Uncertainties</br><br>Author: Yingyan Lou, Assistant Professor, The University of Alabama, 260 H.M. Comer, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487, United States of America, ylou@eng.ua.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Fonseca, Gary Moynihan, Peiheng Li, Saravanan Gurupackiam</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This research addresses the determination of the onset and duration of contraflow operations for hurricane evacuation planning. A modeling framework is developed featuring (1) an underlying traffic flow model to describe traffic dynamics; (2) incident identification and characterization using artificial intelligence; (3) various optimization techniques for decision making under uncertainties; and (4) a computer-based decision support system. A case study of I-65 in Alabama is provided.</br>
