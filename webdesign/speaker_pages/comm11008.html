Title: Data Quality Assessment by Robust Clustering<br>Author: Rong Duan, AT&T, 180 Park Ave, Florham Park, NJ, United States of America, rongduan@att.com<br>Coauthor(s): Tom Au, Wei Jiang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Data mining results may be unreliable to represent useful knowledge if data quality is poor. This paper proposed a generic framework for data quality assessment in nonhomogeneous environments based on robust clustering analysis. In particular, trimmed clustering methods are proposed to robustly characterize groups of similar observations and trimmed observations are then evaluated to assess outlying-ness based on their distance with the cluster profiles.
