<br>Title: Ensemble Modeling for Manufacturing Scale-up through Experimental and Observational Data Fusion</br><br>Author: Ran Jin, Assistant Professor, Virginia Tech., 1145 Perry St., Blacksburg, VA, 24060, United States of America, jran5@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xinwei Deng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In modern manufacturing scale-up efforts, both experimental and observational data are available for material, process and quality. Current research efforts limited their scope on modeling quality-process relationship based on single type of data. This paper presents an innovative method to model the quality-process relationship by the fusion of the two types of data. An ensemble modeling strategy is developed, and case studies in both simulation and wafer manufacturing are provided.</br>
