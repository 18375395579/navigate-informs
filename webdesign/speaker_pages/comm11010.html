Title: Modeling and Prediction of Degradation Profiles in Tissue-engineered Scaffold Fabrication<br>Author: Li Zeng, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Arlington, 500 West First Street, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, lzeng@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xinwei Deng, Jian Yang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Tissue-engineered scaffolds is an important bio-manufacturing products, which plays a critical role in the development of engineered tissues/organs. One important quality characteristic of tissue-engineered scaffolds is their degradation profile in human bodies. This study builds statistical models for the degradation profiles and considers predicting degradation of scaffolds under given experimental settings based on the model.
