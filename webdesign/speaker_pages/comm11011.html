Title: Stochastic Modeling and Prognostics for Complex Systems with Discrete Interactive Degradation<br>Author: Linkan Bian, PhD Candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Groseclose 0205, Room 417, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, linkanbian@gatech.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In many engineering systems, the lifetime distributions of the components are dependent. Many models on the reliability are developed on the premise that the components are independent. We present a degradation framework to model the degradation signals. We conduct a series of simulation studies and compare the performance of our approach with a model, which does not consider component independence.
