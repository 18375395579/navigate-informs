<br>Title: Distribution-Free SPC Methods for Monitoring Variability</br><br>Author: Seong-Hee Kim, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, United States, skim@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of monitoring variability of autocorrelated processes. This paper combines variance estimation techniques from simulation literature with two statistical process control charts from statistical process control (SPC) literature. The proposed SPC methods do not require any assumptions on the distribution of the underlying process and determine the control limits analytically.</br>
