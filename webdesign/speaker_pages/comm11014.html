Title: Estimation of Nested Logit Models using Data from a Single Firm<br>Author: Jeff Newman, Research Engineer, Georgia Institute of Technology, 790 Atlantic Drive, Civil Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, jeff@newman.me<br>Coauthor(s): Laurie Garrow, Mark Ferguson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We examine identification issues for estimating parameters for discrete choice models with censored data. Most work in revenue management using such models has been focused on simple multinomial logit models, because the unique IIA property of this model makes estimating and applying parameters convenient. However, IIA is not usually consistent with actual choice behaviors. We examine the benefits and drawbacks of employing a nested logit model, which does not exhibit IIA.
