<br>Title: Implicit Information Diffusion Networks on Twitter</br><br>Author: Stanislav Nikolov, Twitter, 155 Harriet Street Ste 4, San Francisco, CA, 94103, United States of America, snikolov@twitter.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study how a topic spreads on Twitter using a novel way of inferring the diffusion network. Using knowledge of the Twitter follow graph and the timing of tweets, we infer how the topic might have spread from user to user by recording when a user that has mentioned the topic influences some of her followers to mention it a short time later. We investigate the dynamics and statistical properties of such networks and use them to formulate and evaluate models of information diffusion.</br>
