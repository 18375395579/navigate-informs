<br>Title: Combining Expert Judgment Using Structural Equation Models</br><br>Author: Melissa Kenney, PhD Candidate,  Water Quality Modeling and Decision Analysis, Duke University, Nicholas School of the Environment, Box 90328, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, m.kenney@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Clemen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We describe a method for combining multiple expert judgments using structural equation modeling. The method requires the use of a latent variable that can be viewed as an “ideal?expert judgment, where the individual experts are modeled as multiple measures of the ideal judgment. By using expert data with actual outcomes of the predicted variable and other covariates, we can estimate the relative expert weights and use them in a predictive model. We applied the method to study lake pollution.</br>
