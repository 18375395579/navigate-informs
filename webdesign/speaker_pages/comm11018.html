To gain insight into these patterns of activity with respect to day of the week, we use principal component analysis to demonstrate similarities between individual days.  This information is helpful in selecting representative traffic days for the purpose of simulation or other analyses.  In addition this technique can be extended to show trends over time and across user groups.</br>
