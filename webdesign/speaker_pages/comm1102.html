<br>Title: On Good Quantile Assessors</br><br>Author: Victor Richmond Jose, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, Box 90120, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, vrj@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert L. Winkler</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Quantile assessments are commonly encountered in the elicitation of probability distributions in decision analysis, forecasting, and risk analysis.  We discuss aspects of goodness in evaluating quantile forecasts and draw comparisons with the evaluation of probability forecasts.  In particular, we focus on the motivation, properties, and potential use of proper scoring rules for quantiles.</br>
