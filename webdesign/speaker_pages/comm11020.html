<br>Title: A Model for Optimal Allocation of HIV Prevention and Treatment Funds</br><br>Author: Margaret Brandeau, Stanford University, Huang Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, brandeau@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sabina Alistar, Elisa Long, Eduard Beck</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a model to determine the optimal allocation of resources between HIV prevention and treatment services to minimize the basic reproduction number.  Our model includes multiple populations with different transmission modes, as well as production functions that relate investment in prevention and treatment to changes in transmission and treatment rates.  We apply our model to examine HIV epidemic control in two different settings, Uganda and Russia.</br>
