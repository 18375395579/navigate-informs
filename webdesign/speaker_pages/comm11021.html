Title: Pricing Asian Options via Laplace Transforms<br>Author: Ning Cai, Graduate Student, Columbia University, Industrial Engineering & Operations Research, New York, NY, United States, nc2118@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steve Kou<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Previous Laplace inversions for Asian options are complicated and have some stability problems. In this paper we present a new representation so that Laplace transforms can be obtained easily and inverted in a stable way. Furthermore, the method works in a broader setting include both the classical Brownian model and models with jumps.
