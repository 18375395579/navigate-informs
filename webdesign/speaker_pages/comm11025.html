The FMS operations comprising of Pallet station, Machining Centers and Unloading station with an AGV system is simulated under dynamic environment. The dynamism in the system is created by assuming stochastic arrival rate for parts, uniform processing times at machining centers, AGVs for handling materials.  This environment is simulated using ARENA 10.0.  The results of an hypothetical FMS simulation are utilized as inputs and output parameters such as AGV utilization and Resource utilization and multivariate analysis were conducted  and establishing the control limits for performance measures.  The results indicate a significant relationship between the global decision rules and the output indicators.</br>
