<br>Title: Airlines On-time Performance and Airport Gate Policy Modeling</br><br>Author: Jasenka Rakas, Ph.D, University of California at Berkeley, Nextor, 107B McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, jrakas@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Arnaud Boubert, Valentine Calloud</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study develops a methodology for the analysis of airlines on-time  performance characteristics.   Gate delays are computed by using Performance  Data Analysis and Reporting System (PDARS) actual arrival times (plus taxi-in times) and the Official Airline Guide (OAG) scheduled gate arrival times.  The proposed model suggests new airport gate policy alternatives as a function of gate delay variations that relate to (i) origin airports, (ii) airline characteristics, (iii) utilized runways and (iv) weather conditions.</br>
