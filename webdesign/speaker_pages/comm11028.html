Title: Machine-learning Functional Connectivity Analysis for the Prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment<br>Author: Gianluca Gazzola, PhD Student, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, ggazzola@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Grabowski, Paul Borghesani, Art Chaovalitwongse, Myong K Jeong<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We introduce an fMRI data classification framework for the prediction of mild cognitive impairment. We extract an array of novel features from resting-state brain activity to characterize functional associations within and between regions of interest. We PCA-transform and select features to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier. We validate our technique on a data set from the Seattle Longitudinal Study, obtaining accurate predictions for more than 90% of the subjects.
