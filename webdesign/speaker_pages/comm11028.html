We extract an array of novel features from resting-state brain activity to characterize functional associations within and between regions of interest. We PCA-transform and select features to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier. We validate our technique on a data set from the Seattle Longitudinal Study, obtaining accurate predictions for more than 90% of the subjects.</br>
