Title: Sustainable Investment Decision Analysis: Integrated Techno-economic Analysis for a Biofuel Initiative<br>Author: Scott Mongeau, Principal Consultant, Nyenrode Business University<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: An integrated modeling and assessment technique known as techno-economic analysis is emerging as a promising method to address the inherent complexity associated with sustainable energy project decision management. Via a practical case involving a bioethanol R&D project for a biomaterials conglomerate, key considerations related to techno-economic decision analysis are examined.  A unique process-oriented analysis approach was composed and applied to guide decision making for the firm which resulted in the launch of a collaborative partnership venture to deploy an experimental cellulosic biofuel plant.  The integrated approach, involving NPV modeling, Monte Carlo analysis, and Real Options Analysis (ROA), is discussed in terms of methodological, technical, and practitioner considerations.
