Title: Lookahead or Lookback: A Hybrid Architecture in Approximate Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Haitao Li, Assistant Professor, University of Missouri-St. Louis, 229 Express Scripts Hall, One University Blvd, St. Louis, MO, 63121, United States of America, lihait@umsl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Keith Womer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The complementary strengths of lookup table and rollout policy in approximate dynamic programming have motivated the idea of combining the two. On one hand, the lookup table directly associates the cost-to-go function with a state-action pair, which offers an accurate and reliable function approximation. On the other hand, for a high-dimensional MDP, it is often not possible to visit every state. For those state-action pairs that have not been visited/evaluated by the lookup table, the rollout approach can be employed to evaluate them. This hybrid approximation architecture has been implemented for stochastic project scheduling problems and shows promising results.
