In this work, we propose a hierarchical model integrated with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) structure and auto-regression (AR) to model the temporal gene expression profile on both expression level and state level so that all these tasks can be addressed in a unified framework. We illustrate the method on a vaccacine study.</br>
