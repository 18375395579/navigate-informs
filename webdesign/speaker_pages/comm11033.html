Title: Competitive Facility Location and Design Problem: Identifying Optimal Designs<br>Author: Robert Aboolian, California State San Marcos, San Marcos, CA, United States of America, raboolia@csusm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dmitry Krass, Oded Berman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper we develop a novel methodology to simultaneously optimize locations  and designs for a set of new facilities facing competition from some pre-existing fa-  cilities. Known as the Competitive Facility Location and Design Problem (CFDLP),  this model was previously only solvable when a limited number of design scenarios was  pre-specied. Our methodology removes this limitation and allows for solving of much  more realistic models. The results are illustrated with a small case study.
