Title: Models and Algorithms for Effective Emergency Supply Planning<br>Author: Zhihong Shen, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Avenue, GER-240,, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, shenz@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fernando Ordonez, Maged Dessouky<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A key ingredient in an effective response to an emergency is the prompt availability of the necessary supplies at the emergency sites. Many unique features require the creation of new models of planning in order to develop a rational deployment strategy. We model the disbursement of medical supplies in an emergency circumstance into a facility location and routing problems. Simulation results show the benefits of this formulation based on LA county data.
