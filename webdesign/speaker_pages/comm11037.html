It is important to incorporate those environmental variables into the degradation path. Physical knowledge often suggests nonlinear degradation path. We propose a nonlinear mixed effects model incorporating with dynamic covariates to model the degradation path. Shape-restricted splines are used and an alternating algorithm is proposed. An outdoor weathering dataset is used for illustrations.</br>
