The methodology is based on a set of well-known benchmarks for the multi-depot VRP. We analyze environmental impacts in collaborative and non-collaborative scenarios making comparisons between costs in road transportation with and without those environmental costs. Finally, this methodology is illustrated with the results of a case study.
