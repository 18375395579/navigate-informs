Title: A Bayesian Framework for Online Parameter Estimation and Process Adjustment using Categorical Observations<br>Author: Kaibo Wang, Associate Professor, Tsinghua University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Beijing, China, kbwang@tsinghua.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Jing Lin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In certain manufacturing processes, low resolution categorical observations could be obtained as feasible and low-cost surrogates for accurate readings. In this work, a new online approach for parameter estimation and run-to-run process control using categorical observations is developed. The new approach is built in the Bayesian framework; it provides a convenient way to update parameter estimates when categorical observations arrive gradually in a real production scenario.
