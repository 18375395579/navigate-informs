Title: On Finding Compact Tree-Based Representations from Observed Dynamic Data<br>Author: Michel Minoux, Professor, University of Paris, 4 Place Jussieu, Paris Cedex 05, F-75252, France, michel.minoux@lip6.fr<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Many dynamic optimization problems require models of time-dependent data (such as temperature, prices on markets, etc.) based on past observations or on anticipated 'scenarios'.  We discuss  0-1 integer formulations of the problem of inferring, from  given lists of scenarios,  compact tree-based  models representing such dynamic processes.
