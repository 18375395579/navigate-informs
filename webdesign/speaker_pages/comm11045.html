<br>Title: Performance and Properties of Q-statistic Monitoring Schemes</br><br>Author: Scott Nestler, U.S. Military Academy, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, scott.nestler@us.army.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Zantek</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the Shewhart chart of Q statistics proposed for the detection of process mean shifts in start-up processes and short runs.  Exact expressions for the run-length distribution of this chart are derived and evaluated using an efficient procedure.  Operational guidelines for practitioners implementing the chart are discussed, including interpreting point patterns on the chart and requiring multiple signals from the chart before responding, a practice sometimes followed with Shewhart charts.</br>
