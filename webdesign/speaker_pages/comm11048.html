Title: Efficiency Analysis of Hospitals<br>Author: Sriram Venkataraman, Doctoral Student, Clemson University, 100 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634-130, United States of America, svenkat@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Sun, Maria Ibanez, Aleda Roth, Anita Tucker<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper estimates efficiencies of hospitals in the U.S., using input and output measures from publically available data sources. We introduce a consistent bootstrap technique from data envelopment analysis literature to compare hospitals on various bases and draw meaningful statistical inference. We also test the assumption of returns to scale.
