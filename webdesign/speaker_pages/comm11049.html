Title: Integrating Predictive Dynamic Travel Times in City Logistics Routing<br>Author: Lan Jiang, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, lan@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hani S. Mahmassani<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Time-varying trip times produced by a traffic estimation and prediction system are used in dynamic routing decisions for pick-up/distribution fleets.   The impact of these vehicles on trip times is in turn incorporated in the predictive framework.  Notions of mutual consistency in a rolling horizon framework are discussed.
