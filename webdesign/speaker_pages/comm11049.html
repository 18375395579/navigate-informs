Mahmassani</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Time-varying trip times produced by a traffic estimation and prediction system are used in dynamic routing decisions for pick-up/distribution fleets.   The impact of these vehicles on trip times is in turn incorporated in the predictive framework.  Notions of mutual consistency in a rolling horizon framework are discussed.</br>
