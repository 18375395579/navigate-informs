<br>Title: Data Reconstruction for Identity Disclosure Protection</br><br>Author: Xiaobai (Bob) Li, College of Management, University of Massachusetts Lowell, One University Ave., Lowell, MA, 01854, United States, xiaobai_li@uml.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Zhu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a data reconstruction approach for privacy protection in data mining. The proposed approach uses a set of techniques, including aggregation, swapping, and instance selection via genetic algorithms, to reconstruct data to achieve k-anonymity protection in predictive data mining.</br>
