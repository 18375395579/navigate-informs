Title: Determining OSPF Routing Policies in the Presence of Active Queue Management<br>Author: Jiaxin Liu, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, Canada, j69liu@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Stanko Dimitrov, Laura Sanita<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a mathematical model to derive OSPF routing policies in the presence of router active queue management.  We discuss the computational complexity of the proposed general model.  A modified model is proposed to ensure edge weights are realizable and feasible.  We conclude by showing the derived routing policies tend to perform better than those used in a real world network.
