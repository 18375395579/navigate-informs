We describe the following design features and usage scenarios of SPInE: (a) the connection of Stochastic AMPL to a scenario generator library; (b) the use of SPInE as an ex-ante decision tool; (c) how SP solvers are adopted and embedded to compute the distribution of the objective function value; (d) how back testing, simulation and stress testing are organised.</br>
