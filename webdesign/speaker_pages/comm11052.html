Title: Software Tool for Decision Making Under Uncertainty: A Combined Paradigm of SP and Simulation<br>Author: Christian Valente, Doctoral Candidate, CARISMA, Brunel University/ Optirisk Systems, John Crank Building, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, United Kingdom, Christian.Valente@brunel.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Gautam Mitra<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We report on the work in progress in the design and the enhancement of our Stochastic Programming Integrated Environment: SPInE. We describe the following design features and usage scenarios of SPInE: (a) the connection of Stochastic AMPL to a scenario generator library; (b) the use of SPInE as an ex-ante decision tool; (c) how SP solvers are adopted and embedded to compute the distribution of the objective function value; (d) how back testing, simulation and stress testing are organised.
