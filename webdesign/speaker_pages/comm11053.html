Title: A Confidence Interval for Expected Shortfall via Two-level Simulation<br>Author: Hai Lan, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd, IEMS, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, h-lan@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeremy Staum, Barry L Nelson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop and evaluate a two-level simulation procedure that produces a confidence interval for expected shortfall, a risk measure. The outer level of simulation generates scenarios and the inner level estimates the portfolio’s loss in each scenario. Our procedure uses the statistical theory of empirical likelihood to construct a confidence interval, and it uses tools from the ranking-and-selection literature to make the simulation efficient.
