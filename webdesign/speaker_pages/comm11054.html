Title: Reliability of Sensors Based on Nanowire Networks<br>Author: Kristin McCullough, Grand View University, Des Moines, IA, 50316, United States of America, kmccullo4@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Nader Ebrahimi, Zhili Xiao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Advances in nanotechnology have enhanced the performance of sensors. In this talk we focus on the reliability of a Palladium nanowire network based hydrogen sensor. We use a square lattice to model the structure and assume the sensor is operating in an environment where the probability of a wire breaking changes after hydrogen exposure. We also consider the case where the probability does not change. The results are applicable to any nanodevice where the proposed model is a reasonable choice.
