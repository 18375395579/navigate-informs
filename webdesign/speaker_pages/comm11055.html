<br>Title: Anticipative Analysis, Information Systems, and Social Responsibility Driven Decision Analysis</br><br>Author: Orhan Güvenen, Professor, Bilkent University, Bilkent University DSEE, FEASS, Z-03 06800 Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey, gorhan@bilkent.edu.tr</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In dynamic systems the analysis of any problem in time t and its evolution for the future, dominantly can be explained with an acceptable error margin. A non linear anticipative analysis, through the dominant trends of information systems, endogenizing socio-economic responsibility, may converge to an estimation of the alternative costs of not solving the problem in time t. The research analyses this approach and its value added to decision analysis.</br>
