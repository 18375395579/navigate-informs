<br>Title: Combinatorial Agency</br><br>Author: Moshe Babaioff, University of California, Berkeley</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michal Feldman, Noam Nisan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The field of Algorithmic Mechanism Design handles the issue of private information held by different selfish'' parties in computational settings. This paper deals with a complementary problem: handling the hidden actions'' that are performed by the different parties. Our focus is on cases where {\em complex combinations} of the actions influence the outcome. We present formal models for this setting, suggest and embark on an analysis of some basic issues, but leave many questions open.</br>
