Title: A Simulated Annealing Approach for Treatment Unit Delineation<br>Author: Joseph Petroski, Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Bureau of Forestry, Inventory, and Analysis, 137 Penn Nursery Road, Spring Mills, PA, 16875, United States, jpetroski@state.pa.us<br>Coauthor(s): Marc McDill<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Spatially explicit timber harvest scheduling requires the delineation of treatment units across a landscape.  A multiple objective, simulated annealing model is presented that delineates treatment units using a triangle grid.  Treatment units are built by aggregating or splitting groups of adjacent triangles.
