These systems often rely on data sources that are chosen based on loose guidelines or out of convenience. Here, we present a new, data-driven method for designing surveillance systems. Our approach is a geographic optimization of data sources designed to achieve specific surveillance goals. The resulting networks outperformed existing systems when predicting seasonal and pandemic influenza hospitalizations.
