We develop a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to find the optimal timing of the biopsy that maximizes the total quality-adjusted expected life of each patient. We perform a structural analysis and use clinical data to solve the MDP model. Our results show that optimal biopsy decisions are age-dependent.
