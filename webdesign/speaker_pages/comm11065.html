Title: Robustness and Accuracy of Naive Bayes Classifier for Remaining Useful Life Prediction<br>Author: Selina Ng, City Univ of Hong Kong, SEEM Dept, CityU,, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, selina.ng@my.cityu.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Kwok-Leung Tsui<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper investigates the use of a popular data-driven classifier in the state-of-health prognostics of Lithium-ion battery. The theory, methodology, and performance of naive Bayes in remaining useful life prediction over time are studied. An empirical procedure is presented and applied to publicly available battery data, and the performance of naive Bayes in terms of both accuracy and robustness is compared to another popular method, support vector machine.
