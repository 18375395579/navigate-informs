The theory, methodology, and performance of naive Bayes in remaining useful life prediction over time are studied. An empirical procedure is presented and applied to publicly available battery data, and the performance of naive Bayes in terms of both accuracy and robustness is compared to another popular method, support vector machine.</br>
