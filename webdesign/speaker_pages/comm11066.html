Title: Using Simulation to Evaluate Colonoscopy Screening Protocols for Secondary CRC Prevention<br>Author: Fatih Safa Erenay, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States of America, erenay@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ritesh Banerjee, Oguzhan Alagoz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In order to prevent a second occurrence of colorectal cancer (secondary CRC), patients periodically undergo colonoscopy screenings after the treatment of their first CRC. We build a simulation model that mimics the progression of secondary CRC under a given screening protocol. We use this model to estimate unknown parameters governing the progression of secondary CRC, and evaluate the performance of reasonable screening protocols based on the risk of secondary CRC and total treatment cost.
