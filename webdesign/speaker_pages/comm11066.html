We build a simulation model that mimics the progression of secondary CRC under a given screening protocol. We use this model to estimate unknown parameters governing the progression of secondary CRC, and evaluate the performance of reasonable screening protocols based on the risk of secondary CRC and total treatment cost.</br>
