Our model involves the simultaneous selection of base station location and antenna type combinations, MTSO and PSTN gateway locations, construction of the backbone network, and assignment of service of subscriber locations to antenna sectors while satisfying reliability,capacity, and QoS requirements. An extensive empirical analysis is performed with multiple strategies to obtain good feasible solutions and tight upper bounds.</br>
