<br>Title: Delay Modeling Using Center and National Weather Impacted Traffic Indices</br><br>Author: Dr. Banavar Sridhar, NASA Ames Research Center, Banavar.Sridhar@nasa.gov</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The total aggregate delay experienced by aircraft in the United States is a measure of performance of the air traffic management system. Weather is a major factor causing delay. This paper describes a classification methodology and a three-step regression model to provide a comprehensive approach to estimate delay. The methodology is verified using national traffic, weather and delay data for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006.</br>
