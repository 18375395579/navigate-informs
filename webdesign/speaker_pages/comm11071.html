<br>Title: Mathematical Model and Agent-based Model: A Comparative Study on the Performance of Sepsis</br><br>Author: Chih-Hang(John) Wu, Associate Professor, Kansas State University, 2037 Durland Hall, Manhattan, KS, 66506, United States of America, chw@ksu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhenzhen Shi, David Ben-Arieh</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a system dynamics mathematical model and multi-agent-based model (MABM), which model and simulate the innate immunity and adaptive immunity of sepsis, especially getting insights into the time and intensity of intervention of anti-inflammatory cytokines in sepsis evolution. By comparing the results from both models, we conclude that MABM is more realistic approach to simulate sepsis progression.</br>
