<br>Title: Data Mining Approach for the Study of MRSA Infection in RCHE and Hospital</br><br>Author: Yizhen Hai, City University of Hong Kong, Y1618, SEEM&MBE lab, AC1, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, yizhenhai2@student.cityu.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vincent CC Cheng, Shui-Yee Wong, Kris Baoqian Pan, Kwok Tsui, Kwok-Yung Yuen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Due to the advancement of data collection technology and computational capability, it is feasible to apply statistical data mining tools in health and medical applications. These models facilitate decision making of treatment, disease surveillance and infection control. In this paper we show that, based on the data generated from the hospital’s information system, proper statistical models combined with case-control study could be applied to extract useful knowledge in medical analysis.</br>
