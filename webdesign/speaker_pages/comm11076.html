Title: Latent Space Mixture Models of Dynamic Graphs and Networks<br>Author: Edo Airoldi, Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, eairoldi+@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eric Xing<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Statistical models often inform the analysis of networks of scientific interest (Fienberg et al. 1985; Wasserman & Pattison 1996; Watts & Strogatz 1998; Kossinets & Watts 2006). We introduce a hierarchical model of network evolution that combines mixed membership (Airoldi et al. 2006) and a latent space (Hoff et al. 2002) for learning dynamic connectivity patterns among nodes. We develop a fast, approximate posterior inference algorithm, and analyze Enron's email communication network.
