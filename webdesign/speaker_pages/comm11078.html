<br>Title: Simulation and Data-integrated Decisions for Revenue Maximization of Coalmines</br><br>Author: Sai Srinivas Nageshwaraniyer, Research Assistant, The University of Arizona, 1127 E James E Rogers Way, P.O. Box 210020, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, ngsaisrinivas@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chao Meng, Young-Jun Son, Sean Dessureault</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a simulation-based approach for material handling system (MHS) to maximize revenue of a coalmine. A Markov chain and Taguchi design of experiments is respectively used to mimic and identify equipment conditions based on historical data. A simulation model of MHS along with heuristics considering the Markovian property of equipment is used to obtain best settings for equipment scheduling. Real data from a large coalmine is used to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach.</br>
