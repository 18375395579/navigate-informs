A Markov chain and Taguchi design of experiments is respectively used to mimic and identify equipment conditions based on historical data. A simulation model of MHS along with heuristics considering the Markovian property of equipment is used to obtain best settings for equipment scheduling. Real data from a large coalmine is used to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach.
