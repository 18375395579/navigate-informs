However, fewer than 20% of patients who need a transplant actually receive one. Many potentially useful organs are discarded because of limited means to evaluate the viability and potential long-term function of organs. In this research, we develop a viability evaluation index based on biopsy image data. We validate the organ viability index based on the study of isolated, perfused pig livers.</br>
