Several parametric models including MNL, Nested Logit, and Mixture of MNL are widely used in practice but the selection of optimal model is not usually clear. We present a non-parametric choice model that is a simultaneous approximation for a large class of choice models. Furthermore, we give a polynomial time algorithm to compute an optimal assortment under this choice model.</br>
