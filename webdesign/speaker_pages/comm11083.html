Title: A Simultaneous Approximation for Many Choice Models<br>Author: Vineet Goyal, Columbia University, 500W 120th St, New York, NY, United States of America, vgoyal@ieor.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jose Blanchet, Guillermo Gallego<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Modeling customer choice probabilities is a critical problem in assortment optimization problems. Several parametric models including MNL, Nested Logit, and Mixture of MNL are widely used in practice but the selection of optimal model is not usually clear. We present a non-parametric choice model that is a simultaneous approximation for a large class of choice models. Furthermore, we give a polynomial time algorithm to compute an optimal assortment under this choice model.
