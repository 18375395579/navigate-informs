<br>Title: Energy Storage Systems, Stochastic Optimization and Robust Control</br><br>Author: Alberto Lamadrid, Assistant Professor, Lehigh University, 621 Taylor Street, room 451, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, ajlamadrid@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tim Mount, Ray Zimmerman, Carlos Murillo-Sanchez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper formulates an energy storage problem, in the context of high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES), as used by System Operators in their daily operations.   Our suggested model has an electricity network system planner seeking to maximize the welfare of consumers and producers, procuring energy and ancillary services using a security constrained Optimal Power Flow (SC-OPF) and reproducing the uncertainty in the system by using a Markovian transition probability matrix.</br>
