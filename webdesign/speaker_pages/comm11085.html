<br>Title: Discrete-time Dynamic Traffic Assignment Models for Managed Lanes</br><br>Author: Qipeng (Phil) Zheng, Ph.D. Student, University of Florida, Industrial & Systems Engineering, 303 Weil Hall, ISE, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, zqp@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Siriphong Lawphongpanich, Yafeng Yin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present discrete-time traffic assignment models for managed lanes such as HOV and HOT lanes.  Unlike discrete-time models for general networks, our models have a simple network structure and their upper bounds can be obtained by solving mixed-integer optimization problems using, e.g., Benders decomposition.  Also, numerical results will be presented.</br>
