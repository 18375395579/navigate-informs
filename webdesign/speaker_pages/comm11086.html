Title: An Intelligent Augmentation of Particle Swarm Optimization with Ensemble of Metamodels<br>Author: Mengqi Hu, Assistant Professor, Mississippi State University, PO Box 9542, 260 McCain Hall, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, United States of America, mhu@ise.msstate.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this research, we propose to augment Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) via the fusion of ensemble of metamodels for simulation optimization which is termed as PSO-EM. An ensemble of metamodels which combines multiple stand-alone metamodels is adaptively developed to replace the computational expensive simulation model. The performance of the proposed PSO-EM is tested on several benchmark functions, and the results demonstrate that PSO-EM outperforms several state-of-the-art PSO algorithms.
