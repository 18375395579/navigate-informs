<br>Title: A Stochastic Framework for Sensory-based Prognostics in Synchronous Generators</br><br>Author: Murat Yildirim, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Groseclose 0205, Room 415, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, murat@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Linkan Bian, Nagi Gebraeel</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Despite their economic significance as the primary sources of electricity, synchronous generators have not benefited from sensory-based prognostics. The difficulty arises due to the large number of subcomponents and the complexities in their corresponding failure processes. This work uses physics of failure models to provide a closed-form expression for the remaining life distribution of synchronous generators. Degradation is modeled as a competing risks type stochastic process.</br>
