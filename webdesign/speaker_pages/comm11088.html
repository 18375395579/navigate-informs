Vicente.    The novelty of this paper is in the application of sparse signal recovery to the construction of polynomial interpolation models of functions with sparse Hessians. In general, constructing an accurate second-order interpolation model of a smooth function requires O(n^2) samples. Bandeira et al. show that if the Hessian contains only s nonzeros, then using sparse recovery via l-1 minimization, one can construct an accurate second-order model using only O(s log^4(n)) samples. When applied to derivative-free optimization, the techniques developed significantly reduce the number of evaluations necessary for function approximation via sampling, and thus accelerate the optimization of complex systems such as those whose objective functions are calculated by a costly black-box simulation.
