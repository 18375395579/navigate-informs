Analysis of network models using DOE is sometimes accomplished through traditional ordinary least squares regression, which may result in non-normality of residuals of fitted models.  A full factorial design augmented with a nearly orthogonal Latin hypercube of a SNA technique is examined via a linear model constructed using quantile regression to mitigate the non-normality of the error terms.</br>
