Title: Discrete Barrier and Lookback Options under Stochastic Volatility Model<br>Author: Nan Chen, Assistant Professor, Chinese University of Hong Kong, 709A, William Mong Engineering Building, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The stochastic volatility model suggested by Heston (1993) receives much attention in the community of quantitative finance. However, there is little progress in the direction of path-dependent option pricing beyond the close form Fourier transforms of vanilla European options. In this article, we develop a recursion algorithm to price discretely monitored barrier and lookback options based on the Heston stochastic volatility model.
