<br>Title: Pricing Strategies for Combination Pediatric Vaccine and Their Impact on Market Share</br><br>Author: Sheldon Jacobson, Professor, University of Illinois, 201 N. Goodwin Avenue (MC258), urbana, IL, 61821, United States of America, shj@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Sewell, Matthew (JD) Robbins</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Combination vaccines are becoming the backbone of the US Childhood Immunization Schedule. As more combination vaccines gain FDA approval and become available, vaccine manufacturers are strategically pricing such products to suppress competition.  This presentation shows how optimization models can be used to reveal such predatory pricing strategies.  Results with new and existing combination vaccines are reported.  Approaches to counter such strategies are also discussed.</br>
