Title: A Probabilistic Prediction Framework for Personalized Online Prediction of Epileptic Seizures<br>Author: Shouyi Wang, University of Washington, 3311 NE 65TH Street, Seattle, WA, 98115, United States of America, shouyi@uw.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Art Chaovalitwongse<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The talk presents a novel probabilistic framework which integrates and innovates data mining, machine learning and probability theory for online pattern recognition and prediction of target events from nonstationary time series data. With an attractive adaptive learning capability, the proposed probabilistic framework has been demonstrated to be effective to achieve a personalized online seizure prediction for patients with epilepsy.
