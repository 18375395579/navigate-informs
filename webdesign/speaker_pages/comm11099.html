<br>Title: Non-linear Modeling of Customer Satisfactions</br><br>Author: Nobuhiko Terui, Professor, Tohoku University, Kawauchi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Japan, terui@econ.tohoku.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Taemyung Chun, Kosuke Ogawa, Satoshi Shibata</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Focusing on nonlinear relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty which has been discussed in the literature, we propose non-linear modeling of customer satisfaction index(CSI).  We empirically show that nonlinear model is better than linear model, and non-linear patterns are different across industries according to the competitive environment in a market and consumer's degree of involvement.</br>
