It is surprising that most often the process of creating BSCs is methodological poorly exercised and established techniques of decision analysis are not considered. We introduce a systematic, consistent and efficient approach of creating a BSC using Value-focused Thinking. In a case study, we illustrate the procedure and create a highly individualized media-specific BSC.</br>
