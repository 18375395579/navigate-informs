Both the likelihood and the consequences are uncertain quantities; therefore, risk is inherently uncertain.  The likelihood and the consequence may be expressed either numerically or linguistically.  We determine an aggregate risk result for a network security model using only linguistic values and compare this result to the value of risk determined from only numerical values.</br>
