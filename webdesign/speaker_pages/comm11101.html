<br>Title: Linked Models Predict Climate Change Effects on Wildfire Containment as Subtle but Consequential</br><br>Author: Jeremy Fried, USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, P.O. Box 3890, Portland, OR, 97208, United States, jsfried@fs.fed.us</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Using stochastic and deterministic modeling and bridging the coarse scale output of general circulation models of climate and fine-scale models of initial attack, effects of climate change on wildfire severity and outcomes in California were modeled for a base case and multiple greenhouse gas scenarios. Subtle shifts in fire behavior that might be induced by the climate changes are of sufficient magnitude to generate an appreciable increase in the number of fires that escape initial attack.</br>
