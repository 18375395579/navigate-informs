Our framework covers cases where the underlying likelihood or extremum criterion function is possibly non-concave, discontinuous, and of increasing dimension, but the posterior or quasi-posterior based on it approaches a normal density in large samples. Using this central limit framework to provide structural restrictions for the problem, we show that the running time of the algorithm in large samples is bounded in probability by a polynomial in the parameter dimension $d$, and in particular is $O_p(d^3)$ in the leading cases. Large sample asymptotics allows to invoke the central limit theorem to bound the deviations from continuity and concavity, in a specific manner that allows to claim that the computational complexity is polynomial.</br>
