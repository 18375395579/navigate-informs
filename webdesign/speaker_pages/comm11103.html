Title: Optimal Army Personnel Distribution Using SAS/OR<br>Author: Kenneth Clark, Senior Operations Research Analyst, US Army, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA, 22332, United States of America, kenneth.d.clark1@us.army.mil<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk we describe a flexible mathematical model for optimizing the allocation of Army personnel and its implementation using SAS/OR optimization tools, e.g., proc optmodel. The set manipulation and conditional equation/constraint generation capabilities in proc optmodel facilitate the inclusion of a number of model parameters so that it can be used to perform a range of  important feasibility studies related to personnel distribution planning.
