<br>Title: Internet Routing Under Active Congestion Control</br><br>Author: Stanko Dimitrov, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, 2812 IOE Building, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States, sdimitro@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marina A. Epelman, Dushyant Sharma</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a mathematical model of Internet routing that incorporates congestion control techniques such as random early detection (RED). We show that several model instances are NP-hard and present numerical results comparing current routing policies to the routing policies corresponding to the optimal solution of our model.</br>
