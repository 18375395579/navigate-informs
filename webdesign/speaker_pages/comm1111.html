Xpress has features that make it useful for teaching beginners, including 1) the modeling language Mosel, which makes it easy for beginners to convert algebraic formulations into code, and 2) graphical displays, which help explain the basics of branch-and-bound and -cut. While Xpress is the software I use, any package that provides these facilities could be used in the same way.</br>
