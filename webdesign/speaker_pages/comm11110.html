Title: Estimation Model of Carbon Emissions for Freight Transport under Conditions of Megacities<br>Author: Josue Velazquez, PhD Student, Monterrey Tech, Carlos Lazo 100 Santa Fe, Mexico City, Mexico, josue.velazquez@itesm.mx<br>Coauthor(s): Edgar Blanco, Jan Fransoo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Most methodologies used to estimate carbon emissions due to freight transport activities are based on parameters of developed countries. We conduct a field study for a Parcel Company in Mexico City to provide a model to estimate carbon emissions under conditions of megacities. Using empirical data we compare the model against methodologies used in the US and Europe and the results confirm significant differences among the estimated emissions.
