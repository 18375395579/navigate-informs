Title: Efficient Closed-loop Optimal Control of Petroleum Reservoirs Under Uncertainty<br>Author: Pallav Sarma, Stanford University, pallav@chevron.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Real-time model-based oil and gas reservoir management requires efficient computational techniques for optimizing reservoir performance under uncertainty. Such production optimization problems typically involve large, highly complex reservoir simulation models (numerical models of fluid flow behavior in the subsurface reservoir and surface facilities), with thousands of unknowns and many constraints. Further, our understanding of the subsurface oil and gas reservoir is always highly uncertain, and this uncertainty is reflected in the models. As a result, performance prediction and production optimization, which are the ultimate goals of the entire modeling and simulation process, are generally suboptimal.  This work discusses a model-based closed-loop approach for efficient and accurate real-time production optimization that consists of three key elements - optimization, uncertainty propagation and model updating, and various algorithms such as adjoint models, kernel principal component analysis and polynomial chaos  expansions are proposed/adapted to perform these tasks efficiently.
