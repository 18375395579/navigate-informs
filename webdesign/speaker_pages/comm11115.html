Title: Computational Geometry and Data Fusion in CAD/CAM for Manufacturing System Performance Improvement<br>Author: Yuan-Shin Lee, Professor, North Carolina State University, 400 Daniels Hall, Ind. Eng., CBox 7906, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, yslee@ncsu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper presents methods of computational geometry and data fusion in CAD/CAM for manufacturing system performance improvement.  Techniques of computational geometry processing and data fusion are presented for CAD/CAM decision optimization. Examples are provided on dealing with optimizing in CAD/CAM and CNC machining planes determination problems. The presented methods can be used to automate the traditional, experience-based tool selection tasks and to reduce the total machining time.
