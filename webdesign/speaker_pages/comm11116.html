Title: A System for Optimizing Advance Acquisition of Right-of-Way for Highways at TxDOT<br>Author: Ron Hagquist, Texas Transportation Institute (TTI), 125 E. 11th Street, Austin, TX, 78701, United States of America<br>Coauthor(s): Dong Hun “Don?Kang, Carlos M.

Feldman, Reza Seyedshohadaie<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Acquiring highway right-of-way well in advance of actual construction can avoid substantial escalation of the cost of purchasing parcels.  However, this money could also be used to advance other aspects of existing projects underway. A decision-support system combining simulation and optimization was developed for field use analyzing this classic tradeoff situation, with an optimal minimum-cost solution depending on the parameters of the specific situation.
