<br>Title: Estimating Willingness-to-Pay and Willingness-to-Sell Distributions from Incomplete Negotiation Data</br><br>Author: A. Serdar Simsek, PhD Candidate, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, Uris Hall, 4L, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, asimsek13@gsb.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Garrett Van Ryzin, Robert Phillips</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a method for using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) and willingness-to-sell (WTS) distributions using incomplete negotiation data. The data are incomplete because the final price is recorded only if trade actually takes place and WTP and WTS values are not observed.  The results are promising in terms of the accuracy of the computed estimates and when used to predict take-up on both synthetic and real data sets.</br>
