Title: Growing Profile Monitoring Using Dynamic Time Warping<br>Author: Kaibo Wang, Associate Professor, Tsinghua University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Beijing, China, kbwang@tsinghua.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Ran Jin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This talk focuses on the monitoring of incomplete dynamic profiles with time-varying mean, variation and length. Taking the ingot growing process as an example, we propose to use dynamic-time-warping (DTW) to align profiles having different lengths first, and then compare online but incomplete profiles with a baseline profile for faults detection. Both numerical simulations and real examples are demonstrated for performance comparison.
