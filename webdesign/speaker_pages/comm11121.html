<br>Title: A Parallel Open Software and Hardware Reference Platform for the Operations Research Community</br><br>Author: Timothy Middelkoop, University of Florida, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, t.middelkoop@ufl.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this work we propose that the natural extension of an open source optimization framework is a standards based open software and hardware reference system. We first outline the need for such a platform and its requirement to be parallel followed by an overview of a concept system based on the PS3. We then show that it can be used both to promote the open exchange of ideas and as an educational platform with a low barrier to entry. We conclude with forward looking ideas and a demonstration.</br>
