Currently the inpatient beds have peak usage in the middle of the week, and are under-utilized on other days. Using an integer programming model to find a feasible adjustment to the surgical block schedule, we are able to find a solution such that the predicted use of inpatient beds is level-loaded, providing an effective increase in capacity.
