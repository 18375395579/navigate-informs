<br>Title: Modeling Dynamic Choice Behavior of Customers</br><br>Author: Srikanth Jagabathula, Professor, NYU Stern School of Business, 44 West Fourth Street, KMC Suite 8-74, new york, NY, 10012, United States of America, sjagabat@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gustavo Vulcano</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Traditionally, operational models used for demand predictions model customers as making choices according to a known preference list. In practice, customers?preferences lists are not static and they change over time. We propose a dynamic model for how customers construct preference lists over time as a function of all products that were purchased and were on offer in the past. We show that this model allows us to explain several behavioral biases that have been empirically established.</br>
