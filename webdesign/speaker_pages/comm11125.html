Mohler Laboratory, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, gom204@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aurelie Thiele</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Traditional inventory management assumes the precise knowledge of the underlying demand distribution and a risk-neutral manager. New product introduction does not fit this framework because (i) not enough information is available to compute probabilities and (ii) managers are generally risk-averse. In this work, we investigate the impact of information when the optimal cost is computed using a robust, distribution-free approach. We derive optimality conditions and present simulation experiments.</br>
