Title: European Competitiveness: A Nonparametric Stochastic Firm-level TFP Analysis<br>Author: Marijn Verschelde, Postdoc, Ghent University Department of General Economics, Tweekerkenstraat 2, Ghent, 9000, Belgium, Marijn.Verschelde@UGent.be<br>Coauthor(s): Bruno Merlevede, Glenn Rayp, Michel Dumont<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper analyses TFP at firm-level to obtain insights that are of use for the recent competitiveness debate in Europe. Noise is non-negligible in any large scale firm-level dataset, making the use of deterministic frontier based approaches not advisable. We advocate a nonparametric stochastic frontier based alternative. We decompose and analyze a nonparametric stochastic TFP index using AMADEUS firm-level data of more than 1 million firms covering 20 manufacturing sectors in the EU-15.
