Data from administrative datasets are being used as surrogate markers of flow to model the clinical pathways (during an episode of care) of patients undergoing lung resection procedures. Through simulation, the usual and variant paths will be modeled. The modeling effort should help reduce delays and inefficiencies currently existing in the system.</br>
