Title: Confidence Intervals for Some Learning Problems<br>Author: Shu Lu, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 355 Hanes Hall, Cb#3260, Dept of Stat & OR, UNC, Chapel Hill, No, 27599, United States of America, shulu@email.unc.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Statistical learning problems extract patterns from sample data. Variance in sample data clearly has an effect on the pattern learned. We discuss a method to establish confidence intervals on the learned pattern. This method is based on a general method on confidence regions of stochastic variational inequalities.
