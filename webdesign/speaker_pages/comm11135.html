Title: Strategic Forecasting: An Application of Collaborative Modeling and Simulation<br>Author: Brian Lewis, VP, Professional Services, Vanguard Software, 1100 Crescent Green, Cary, NC, 27518, United States of America, brian.lewis@vanguardsw.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Strategic forecasting is a complex endeavor involving knowledge-exchange capabilities and OR methodologies.  Collaborative Modeling and Simulation frees decision-makers from having to rely on the analysis of a single planner by directly involving key individuals in the modeling process itself. Presented case studies: Forecasting Manufacturing Costs to Improve Product Design; Product Portfolio Simulations for Market Forecasting; and Industry-wide Supply Chain Models for Capacity Planning.
