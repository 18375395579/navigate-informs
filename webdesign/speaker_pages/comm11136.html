Title: Algorithms for Multi Mode Economic Lot Sizing Models for Perishable Products with Carbon Emissions<br>Author: Gokce Palak, Mississippi State University, P.O. Box 9542, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, United States of America, gp192@msstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Geunes, Sandra Eksioglu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We extend economic lot sizing models for age dependent perishable products to minimize costs and carbon emissions. Using a multiple setups cost structure for transportation, we propose algorithms to solve cost-minimization models where one, two or multiple modes of transportation are available. We also develop a lagrangean relaxation based heuristic solve the models under carbon emission considerations.
