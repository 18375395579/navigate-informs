<br>Title: QQ Model: Joint Modeling with Quantitative and Qualitative Responses in Manufacturing Scale-up</br><br>Author: Xinwei Deng, Assistant Professor, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Department of Statistics, 406 Hutcheson Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24060, United States of America, xdeng@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ran Jin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In manufacturing scale-up, both quantitative and qualitative responses are often used to measure the quality of products. In this work, we propose a novel method of jointly modeling quantitative and qualitative responses. The constraint likelihood approach is used to incorporate the inherent features of data and accommodate the association between two types of responses. The merits of the proposed method are illustrated by simulations and a real case study in semiconductor manufacturing.</br>
