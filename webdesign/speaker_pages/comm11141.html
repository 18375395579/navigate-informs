<br>Title: Military Reality Modeling and Approximation</br><br>Author: Amnon Gonen, Holon Institute of Technology, HIT, Golomb 52, Holon, Israel, agonen@hit.ac.il</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Some of the military models are so complicated that users can hardly estimate the magnitude of results. The paper discusses approximation techniques to hit and kill probably. In some cases the physical model of human behavior is approximated by an inverse engineering approach that will be shown by the suppression modeling. In this case, the modeling starts from the results toward their cause and formulate the calculation process that fits these final results.</br>
