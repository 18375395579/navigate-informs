Title: Continuity Properties of Equilibria in Some Fisher and Arrow-Debreu Market Models<br>Author: Lei Wang, Georgia Tech, 500 Northside Circle, #ii2, Atlanta, GA, 30309, United States of America, wanglei@math.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vijay Vazirani<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Following up on the work of Megiddo and Vazirani \cite{MV.2007}, who  determined continuity properties of equilibrium prices and  allocations for perhaps the simplest market model, Fisher's linear  case, we do the same for:    1. Fisher's model with piecewise-linear, concave utilities    2. Fisher's model with spending constraint utilities    3. Arrow-Debreu's model with linear utilities    4. Arrow-Debreu's model with piecewise-linear, concave utilities.
