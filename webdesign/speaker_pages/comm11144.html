<br>Title: Analytical Models for Yard Management in a Distribution Center</br><br>Author: Lourdes A. Medina, Graduate Student, Penn State University, O202 Cunningham Hall, Weston Community Center, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, lam458@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ufuk Bilsel, Richard A. Wysk, Vittal Prabhu, A. Ravi Ravindran</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a combination of optimization and simulation models to improve decision making in yard operations of a distribution center (DC). The optimization model decides truck - dock assignments considering the shipment deadlines, late penalties, loading times etc. Loading times depend on the operations inside the DC modeled by a real time simulation. The models are applied in a large DC in South America and improvements are discussed.</br>
