The Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of a HDD which is closely associated with its useful life is typically about 208,926 Hours. Diagnostics and prognostics studies of HDD performance usually require degrading them quicker than their normal useful lives.  The key issue here is not to “kill?a HDD instantly, but instead gradually over a reasonable period of time, so we can collect degradation performance data over a short period of time.  If we consider mechanical failure of HDD, performance data is usually measured in terms of the vibration characteristics of the HDD, namely amplitude and frequency.  Various techniques of accelerating the “death?of HDD have been reported in the literature.  They are temperature, voltage, dust particles, and scratch on platter surface.  This paper reviews the methodology of each technique, its advantages, and disadvantages.  The paper also reports some results using some of these techniques in our sensors research lab at Northeastern University.</br>
