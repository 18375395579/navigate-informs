Thompson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We show that it is feasible to perform computational equilibrium analysis of complex, realistic microeconomic problems like advertising auctions. By using the Action-Graph Game representation, these auctions can be represented compactly and their Nash equilibria can be computed efficiently. This allows us to relax many of the assumptions that have typically been required by closed-form analysis.
