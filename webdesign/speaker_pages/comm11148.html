For purposes of corporate planning or when incorporating uncertainty, aggregate planning is adequate. We use cluster analysis and both a priori (on raw data) and a posteriori (on the detailed LP formulation) aggregation. Computational results show significant reductions in problem size and CPU run time, while guaranteeing a moderate bound on the error due to aggregation.</br>
