Title: Introducing Distribution Uncertainty in Active Portfolio Management<br>Author: Luis Chavez-Bedoya, Research Professor, Esan Graduate School of Business, Alonso de Molina 1652, Monterrico-Surco, Lima, Peru, l.chavezbedoya@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): John Birge<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In the framework of active portfolio management, we propose a model based on generalized hyperbolic distributions to incorporate the relative confidence given to the consensus excess returns and the forecasted ones. This methodology provides a simple and intuitive way to incorporate distribution uncertainty, and to find closed-form expressions for the optimal portfolio weights.
