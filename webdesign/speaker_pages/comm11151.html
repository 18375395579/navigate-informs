<br>Title: Modeling Terrorist Groups as Dynamic Networks</br><br>Author: Kathleen Carley, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, CASOS, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, kathleen.carley@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Terrorist networks are often difficult to reason about, manage and destabilize. In part, this is because they are a complex adaptive system. And in part, it is because the data available is often problematic. Multi-agent simulations in which the actors operate within a socio-cultural space defined by a series of interlinked networks can be used to reason about terrorist networks and evaluate possible courses of action. Such models are often referred to as dynamic network analysis models.</br>
