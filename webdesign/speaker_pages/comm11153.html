Title: Systematic Block Allocation in Large Academic Medical Centers<br>Author: Cecilia Zenteno, Postdoctoral Fellow, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E62-389, Cambrdige, MA, 02139, United States of America, ceciliaz@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi, Peter Dunn, Tim Carnes, Bethany Daily, Devon Price<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We describe the large-scale implementation of data-driven surgical scheduling strategies at Massachusetts General Hospital. The strategies are based on a range of simulation and integer optimization techniques. The goals were to smooth the surgical census on the surgical floors and to increase timely access to non-elective patients. The models supported the changes in the scheduling practices, and delivered methodologies to study the changes in the respective performance metrics.
