Title: Bayesian Variable Reliability Growth Modelling<br>Author: Thomas Mazzuchi, Professor, George Washington University, 1776 Gst NW, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, mazzu@gwu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present an overview of Bayesian Reliability Growth Modelling. Further, we  develop a new model  for Bayesian Reliability Growth Modeling which can account for various a priori growth patterns. The posterior distributions for all quantities of interest must be obtained via MCMC methods. We illustrate our methodology with real and simulated data.
