Vincent Poor</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, an algorithm is developed for aggregating forecasts of probability from incoherent and abstaining experts. The algorithm approximately solves an NP-Hard problem, admits a provable performance guarantee, and is demonstrated to be orders of magnitude faster than existing tools when tested on several real-world data sets. The tool is practically relevant to risk analysis, since it enables an elicitation methodology in which judges have freedom to choose the events they assess.</br>
