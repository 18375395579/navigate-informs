Title: Population Aggregation and Selection of Nature Reserves<br>Author: Hayri Onal, Professor, Dept. of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champai, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, h-onal@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Briers<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: When designing conservation reserves, the location of species populations within the reserve is important since this affects species?dispersal and long-term persistence.  We present an integer programming model that maximizes the aggregation of species populations and an empirical application of the model to a real data set. The results show that much greater aggregation is achieved by using this approach than alternative configurations based on economic efficiency and spatial compactness.
