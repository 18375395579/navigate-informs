To find an optimal policy to promote such adoption, we build a discrete choice model to represent consumers?behavior in choosing a conventional vehicle versus a PHEV. To further capture the interaction between the transportation and energy sector (fuel, electricity, etc), we propose an iterative approach to integrate our model with an energy-system model (MARKAL).</br>
