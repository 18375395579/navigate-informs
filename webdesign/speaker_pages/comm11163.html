Title: Continuing the Saga:  A Top-down, Sequence-pair Formulation for the Facility Layout Problem<br>Author: Russell Meller, Hefley Professor of Logistics, University of Arkansas, Center for Engr Logistics and Distrb., 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, rmeller@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zeynep Kirkizoglu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk concerns the facility layout problem, which is an extremely difficult optimization problem.  We discuss two recent modeling efforts, a top-down approach to facility layout and the sequence-pair representation, and combine them into a new model.  Unfortunately, the saga continues in that the new model is still an extremely difficult optimization problem.  However, we are able to provide evidence of why the top-down model, rather than the traditional, bottom-up model, is the one to use.
