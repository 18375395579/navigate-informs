Title: Recursive Parameter Estimation for Categorical Process Control<br>Author: Kaibo Wang, Assistant Professor, Tsinghua University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, kbwang@tsinghua.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Fugee Tsung<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This research proposes an online Bayesian framework for parameter estimation when only categorical observations are available for Run-to-Run process adjustment. Low-resolution observations are assumed to become available at the end of each run; the proposed method works in a recursive manner to incorporate new information for parameter estimation. Simulations results are also presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.
