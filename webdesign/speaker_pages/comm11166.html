We model the interaction between dynamic prices and wind-regimes; we analyze how batteries can be used to improve wind-turbines reliability and profitability. We study how forward and option contracts can be used by a wind-turbine to hedge risk and we use conditional value at risk to assess the wind-turbine risk exposure and as a basis for risk-hedging.</br>
