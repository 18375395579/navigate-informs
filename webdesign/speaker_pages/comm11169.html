Title: Fleet Renewal with Electric Vehicles<br>Author: Andrei Neboian, WHU Otto Beisheim School of Management, Valendar, 56179, Germany, andrei.neboian@whu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop three distinct fleet replacement models for La Poste, the French postal operator, considering fully electric vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICVs), subject to cost uncertainty. For La Poste, the results of the model, the corresponding sensitivity analysis and simulations have been instrumental in defining their EV acquisition strategy and quantifying its effects. The outcomes informed La Poste’s decision to acquire 10,000 EVs in 2011.
