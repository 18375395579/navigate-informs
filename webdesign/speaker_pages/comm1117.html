We develop a deterministic fluid model that links these controls to customer flows, the size of the customer base and key performance measures. We generate analytical prescriptions on the optimal decisions for the fluid model, and we show via simulation that these prescriptions yield near-optimal performance for the underlying stochastic system.</br>
