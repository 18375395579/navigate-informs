Title: Optimizing the Amount and Type of Information at Each Level of Decision-Making<br>Author: Moises Sudit, Managing Director/Professor, University at Buffalo, 414 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, sudit@eng.buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Adam Stotz, Rakesh Nagi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: As most military decision-makers drown in data and starve for information, issues on the amount and type of data required at each level of decision-making are prevalent and can be viewed as complex optimization problems. We will present Mathematical Models as well as Information Fusion models with corresponding solution strategies that will give the appropriate situation understanding in a sample naval scenario. Extensions of such models will be used for both strategic and tactical operations.
