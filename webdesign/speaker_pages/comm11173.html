Title: Probabilistic Modeling of Insurgency<br>Author: Paul Kucik, Department of Systems Engineering, United States Military Academy, Mahan Hall, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, pkucik@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: I use the methods of probabilistic risk analysis and systems analysis to represent the dynamic interaction between an insurgent group and the government in order to propose strategies to defeat insurgency.  The model focuses at the village level and includes probabilistic submodels for both the insurgent decisionmaker and the government policymaker, where the insurgent leader’s decisions affect the uncertainties faced by the policymaker, and vice versa.
