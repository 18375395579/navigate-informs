Evidence from the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs<br>Author: Vishal Ahuja, PhD Candidate, University of Chicago, Booth Business School, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, vahuja@chicagobooth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Birge<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate various treatments for Type 2 Diabetes in adults using data from the Veterans Health Administration. We analyze dynamic patterns of glucose lowering therapies, and evaluate the risks of associated diabetes outcomes.  We propose a predictive model to evaluate effectiveness of various glucose-lowering therapies and recommend optimal treatment based on patient characteristics.  The paper addresses confounding measures such as physician bias and unobservable patient characteristics.
