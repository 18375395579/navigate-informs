We analyze dynamic patterns of glucose lowering therapies, and evaluate the risks of associated diabetes outcomes.  We propose a predictive model to evaluate effectiveness of various glucose-lowering therapies and recommend optimal treatment based on patient characteristics.  The paper addresses confounding measures such as physician bias and unobservable patient characteristics.</br>
