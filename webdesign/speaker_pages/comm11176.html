Title: GDXRRW: Exchanging Data between GAMS and R<br>Author: Steven Dirkse, GAMS Development, 1217 Potomac St NW, Washington, DC, 20007-3212, United States of America, sdirkse@gams.com<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ferris, Renger van Nieuwkoop<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We discuss GDXRRW (GDX-R Read/Write), a tool for moving data between GAMS and R.  This data exchange benefits both user communities.  It gives R users the capability to use the superior modeling  and optimization capabilities of GAMS, and it allows for visualization  and analysis of GAMS data directly within R to take advantage of R's  wide range of functionality.  The freely available tool is based on  GDX (GAMS Data eXchange), a well-established and public API for  sharing data.
