Science and Engineering, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, jmerrick@epri.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Young</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The US-REGEN model is a general equilibrium model of the US economy, with a detailed representation of the electric power sector.    The model is designed to answer questions relating to regional and national climate policy design, particularly questions that assess the role of technology development and availability.    This talk will provide an overview of the model’s novel features, including the representation of renewables, power market regulatory structure and end-use electricity demand.</br>
