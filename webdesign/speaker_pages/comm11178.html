Our models, which include both hub location and network design decisions,  investigate two objectives: travel time and safety. We employ Benders's decomposition and branch-and-price strategies along with a fast heuristic. A set of computational experiments, using data from Starkville, MS, investigate the robustness and tractability of the models.</br>
