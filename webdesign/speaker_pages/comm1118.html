Title: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Connectivity on Two Parallel Roadways with a General Headway Distribution<br>Author: Bruce Wang, Professor, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX, United States of America, bwang@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kai Yin, Yunglong Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper, we propose analytical models for the vehicle connectivity on two parallel roadways, assuming general distributions for vehicle headways. Models are derived for the expectation, variance and probability distribution of information propagation distance. Closed form approximation to the expectation is obtained and is numerically shown to agree well with the exact models. In addition, we discuss the effects of signal interference on the information propagation. Monte Carlo simulation results further validate the proposed models. Through simulations, the developed models are also shown to have overcome the deficiencies associated with the commonly used one-roadway models and models with the Poisson assumption for vehicle distribution.
