Title: Algorithmic Trading: Matching the Volume Weighted Average Price<br>Author: Daniel Mitchell, University of Texas, McCombs School of Business, 1 University Station, B6000, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Daniel.Mitchell@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jedrzej Bialkowski, Stathis Tompaidis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a model in which a trader seeks to minimize the deviation between his volume weighted average price and the market's, over a day for one stock.  The model incorporates both  random fluctuations in volume and market impact of trading.  We find some heuristic trading strategies as well as lower bounds on the minimal expected deviation.  The model is calibrated to actual market data and we compare amongst the heuristic strategies using this real data.
