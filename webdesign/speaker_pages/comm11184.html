Title: Imbalanced Support Vector Machine Classification with Label Noise<br>Author: Petros Xanthopoulos, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States of America, petrosx@ucf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Onur Seref, Tallayeh Razzaghi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper we are dealing with the problem of imbalanced classification in the presence of label noise. Typically the most approaches for imbalanced classification demonstrate poor performance in environment with noise. We proposed a Weighted Relaxed Support Vector Machine (WRSVM) approach that combines the principles of cost sensitive learning and constraint relaxation for dealing with this problem.
