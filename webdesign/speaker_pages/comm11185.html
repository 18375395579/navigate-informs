Title: Stochastic Processing Networks<br>Author: J. Michael Harrison, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, harrison_michael@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: About 50 years ago, a general linear model of an operating enterprise was developed by mathematicians and economists working in the area that T. C. Koopmans called “activity analysis.? Stochastic processing networks are a class of system models which extend that powerful conceptual framework in a natural way, adding stochastic variability and feedback control.  This model class has a potentially important role to play in a unified theory of operations management.
