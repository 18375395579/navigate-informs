<br>Title: Forecasting New Product Demand Using a Generalized Heterogeneous Model</br><br>Author: Michael J. Scott, Associate Professor, University of Illinois at Chicago, MIE (MC 251), 842 W. Taylor St., Chicago, IL, 60607, United States, mjscott@uic.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph A. Donndelinger, Jeffery A. Robinson, Luke A. Wissman, Sina Ghotbi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Market research methods for demand forecasting range from conjoint analysis to contingent valuation methods such as the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter.  Their usefulness in new product development is limited by complex relationships between market research methods and market demand models.  We investigate the generalization of market demand models to use market research data from a variety of sources and facilitate interpretation by both practitioners and decision-makers.</br>
