Title: Mapping Nanostructures Resulting from Severe Shear Deformation<br>Author: Ravi Shankar Meenakshisundaram, Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, ravishm@pitt.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Nanostructured metals resulting from severe shear deformation offer novel combinations of functional and mechanical properties to offer innovative device design opportunities. Realizing these requires an understanding of the interconnections between process parameters and statistical distributions of the nanograin size, interface structure and defect densities. Here, I will present integration of experimental methods, electron microscopy and modeling efforts aimed at achieving this elucidation.
