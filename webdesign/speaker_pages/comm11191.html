Tsitsiklis, Eytan Modiano<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk we present the first steps towards a systematic methodology for evaluating the performance of dynamic scheduling policies for switched queueing networks under heavy-tailed traffic. We establish a connection between delay instability of queues and the evolution of the fluid model from certain initial conditions. This enables us to identify the delay unstable queues by simulating the fluid model. Moreover, it allows us to reach a surprising conclusion for special networks of interest.
