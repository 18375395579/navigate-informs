The approach, originally developed by Korhonen (1988) and further by Korhonen and Karaivanova (1999), is interactive and uses a reference direction as a tool for obtaining preference information from a decision maker. We present numerical results concerning the performance of the algorithm. In addition, we propose some ideas to further improve its performance.</br>
