An integral transformation is employed to translate the time-dependent customer arrival rate model to the well-studied time-homogeneous one. A computational optimal control algorithm is proposed to produce the real-time optimal pricing, which is only based on the total customer arrivals without knowing the actual distribution of arrival rates.</br>
