Title: Active Risk Management for Value-creation Optimization in Software and Systems Development<br>Author: Michel Benaroch, Professor of IS, Whitman School of Management, 721 University Avenue, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, 13224, United States of America, mbenaroc@syr.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Goldstein<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop an economic optimization model for managing IT investment risk, building on two research streams. One offers solid ways to control granular cost risks in software development, devoid from this activity’s value-creation aspect. Another uses real options theory to model risk and flexibility in relation to value creation throughout the IT investment lifecycle, devoid from software development details. Our model unifies micro- and macro-level risk management practices in both streams.
