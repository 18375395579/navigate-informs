A Math Programming Model for Post-Disaster Reconstruction</br><br>Author: Michael Johnson, Associate Professor, Department of Public Policy and Public Affairs, John W.

Inspired by the events of Hurricane Katrina, we develop a multiobjective optimization model for urban redevelopment that minimizes the future risk of flood and maximize net social benefit under spatial and equity constraints.  Computational results, using data from New Orleans, are encouraging both for model outputs and solution efficiency.</br>
