Title: Improved New Patient Appointment Scheduling at a British Columbia Cancer Centre<br>Author: Claire Ma, BC Cancer Agency, 600 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 4E6, Canada, Claire.ma@bccancer.bc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Puterman, Scott Tyldesly, Emma Liu, Marianne Taylor, Antoine Saur?<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Motivated by an increasing demand for cancer care and long waits for new patient appointments, there is a need for better appointment scheduling. This talk describes a British Columbia study that developed advanced patient scheduling rules and used a simulation model to compare the rules in terms of wait times, resource utilization and clinic overtime for physicians. A novel aspect of this study is that the mix of oncologist specializations and physician’s availability must be accounted for.
