Title: Towards Broad Appointment Scheduling Policies: Enriched Understanding from Simulation Optimization<br>Author: Ken Klassen, Professor, Brock University, Dept of Finance, Operations & IS, St Catharines, ON, L2S3A1, Canada, kklassen@brocku.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Reena Yoogalingam<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The unique and highly variable characteristics of outpatient clinics make it challenging to develop broad policies for scheduling appointments. The presence of factors such as patient and doctor unpunctuality, interruptions and no-shows further complicates this process. This study uses a simulation-optimization framework based on empirical data to develop general insights into appointment system design.
