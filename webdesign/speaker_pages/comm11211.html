Title: SolverStudio: A Free Integrated Excel Environment for Optimization using Modelling Languages<br>Author: Andrew Mason, Senior Lecturer, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand, a.mason@auckland.ac.nz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Excel's widespread use makes it an ideal tool for teaching and delivering optimization models. However, serious modellers often prefer to use modelling languages such as AMPL, GAMS, PuLP or COOPR/Pyomo. SolverStudio integrates these two worlds by allowing optimization models to be easily developed and solved in Excel. Available free from http://solverstudio.org, SolverStudio also includes support for Python-based Gurobi models, the SimPy simulation environment, and cloud-based solving via NEOS.
