Furthermore, part compliance/flexibility frequently results in ill-conditioned assembly systems posing enormous challenges to process control and fault failure diagnosis.   	We propose an Enhanced PLS-based diagnostic methodology which searches for a set of latent vectors with the search constrained by assembly response function–the Stream-of-Variation (SOVA) model of assembly system–and which performs decomposition of response based on the end-of-line-measurements.</br>
