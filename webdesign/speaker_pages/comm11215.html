Title: Statistical Uncertainty Analysis for Stochastic Simulation<br>Author: Wei Xie, northwestern university, 2145 sheridan Rd. c210, evanston, Il, 60208, United States of America, weixie2013@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Barry Nelson, Russell Barton<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: When we use simulation to evaluate the performance of a stochastic system, the input models are often estimated from real-world data. We derive a confidence interval that accounts for both simulation and input-model uncertainty by using a metamodel-assisted bootstrapping approach. Our approach is rigorously supported with both theoretical analysis and an empirical study.
