The U.S. military has a requirement for units to report an overall readiness rating based on many factors. This research examines the current readiness reporting method and proposes a new benchmarking system based on desirability functions from quality theory, assessing readiness on quantitative and qualitative scales with aggregation so that a holistic approach is taken.</br>
