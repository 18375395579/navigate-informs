<br>Title: Multiscale Adaptive Basis Function Modeling of Spatiotemporal Signals</br><br>Author: Hui Yang, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, huiyang@usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gang Liu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Mathematical models facilitate the characterization and recognition of underlying biological patterns. However, there are practical issues pertinent to model efficacy, robustness, and generality. This paper presents a multiscale adaptive basis function approach to model space-time cardiac pathological behaviors, using the best matching projections of characteristic waves onto a dictionary of nonlinear basis functions. The model performance is experimentally evaluated with real-world signals.</br>
