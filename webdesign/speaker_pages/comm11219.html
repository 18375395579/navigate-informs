Title: Hybrid Communication and Control Algorithms for Managing Aircraft Arrivals<br>Author: Hamsa Balakrishnan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, 33-328, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, hamsa@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pangun Park, Harshad Khadilkar, Claire Tomlin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: New air traffic surveillance technologies such as ADS-B enable more distributed trajectory management, but also raise concerns of interactions with legacy infrastructure. We present an algorithm to manage aircraft arrivals that combines centralized control in congested areas with distributed control in less dense ones. This hybrid approach is evaluated through simulations. Its performance is found to be comparable to fully centralized strategies, despite requiring less ground infrastructure.
