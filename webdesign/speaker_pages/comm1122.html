<br>Title: Indicators of Force Multipliers (INFORM) Model on the Iraq War</br><br>Author: William Fox, Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Department of Defense Analysis, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, wpfox@nps.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This model is based upon a Homeland Sercurity's System Modeling Infrastructure Resiliency created by Driscoll and Goerger. The small example considers 6 variables (3 in each layer) while the big model consdier 30 variables (15 in each layer). We hit the dynamical system with a shock effect and analyze the effect on the Iraqi system.</br>
