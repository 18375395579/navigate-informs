In many applications the number of factors is large (e.g., say 60 factors).   Thus, the number of simulations carried out trials tends to be large.  However, fitting a GP becomes computationally burdensome for large run sizes. Here, we describe strategies we've found useful for fitting such models when the number of simulation runs is large.  The consequences of inadequate run-sizes are discussed.
