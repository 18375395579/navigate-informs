<br>Title: An Augmented Lagrangian Framework for Risk Parity Optimization</br><br>Author: Xi Bai, PhD Candidate, Lehigh University, 461 Montclair Ave., Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, xib210@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Katya Scheinberg</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The risk-parity optimization problem aims to find such portfolio that the contributions of risk are equally weighted. In this talk, we form a general model for risk-parity portfolio construction and propose an augmented Lagrangian framework to solve it. Numerical experiments indicate the effectiveness of our technique in terms of both speed and accuracy.</br>
