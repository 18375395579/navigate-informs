Title: A Mathematical Program to Determine Reserve Zone Partitions<br>Author: Joshua Lyon, PhD Student, Arizona State University, 31000 N Silver Bullet Trl, San Tan Valley, AZ, 85143, United States of America, joshua.lyon@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kory Hedman, Muhong Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Reserve requirements are used to ensure reliability in electric power systems since endogenously modeling all N-1 contingencies is too computationally burdensome. Reserve zones ensure that reserves are dispersed across the network in order to ensure deliverability. This research develops a mathematical program to determine zone partitions for day-ahead unit commitment models while considering the impact on market economics and reliability. Results based on IEEE test cases will be presented.
