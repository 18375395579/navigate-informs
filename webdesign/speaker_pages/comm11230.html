Though the formulation is not Bayesian, a Bayesian-type solution is obtained endogenously. It involves a weighted posterior where the posterior is tilted towards models that performed well historically. The tilting addresses in part the problem of slow convergence often associated with Bayesian learning of the mean.</br>
