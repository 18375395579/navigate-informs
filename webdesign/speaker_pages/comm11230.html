Title: Robust Portfolio Selection and Learning<br>Author: Andrew Lim, Associate Professor, IEOR Department, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, lim@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): George Shantikumar, Lian Yu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We formulate a robust dynamic portfolio selection problem, using the notion of relative regret, in a model where learning is possible. Though the formulation is not Bayesian, a Bayesian-type solution is obtained endogenously. It involves a weighted posterior where the posterior is tilted towards models that performed well historically. The tilting addresses in part the problem of slow convergence often associated with Bayesian learning of the mean.
