<br>Title: Dimension Reduction of Multivariate Auto-correlated Process Data</br><br>Author: Soren Bisgaard, University of Massachusetts - Amherst, 121 Presidents Drive, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, bisgaard@som.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuan Huang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The data used for statistical quality control increasingly are multivariate and sampled individually in time at a high sampling rate.  Hence the data will typically be cross- and auto-correlated high-dimensional vector time series. Although the observed dimension may be high, the underlying variability can often be reduced to a few canonical variables. In this presentation, we will compare two methods for dimension reduction of multivariate data for process control and motivate a better method.</br>
