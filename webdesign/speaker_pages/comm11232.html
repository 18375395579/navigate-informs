Main St, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States of America, elboone@vcu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Albert Lee</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Bayesian inclusion probabilities have become a popular tool for variable assessment.  This presentation shows how a frequentist may evaluate Bayesian inclusion probabilities.  This evaluation looks at both restricted and unrestricted model spaces and develops a framework that can be utilized for inclusion probabilities that preserve Type I error rates.  This framework is applied to an analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana with respect to determining QTL associated with cotelydon opening angle.</br>
