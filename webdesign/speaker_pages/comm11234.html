Title: Safety Evaluation of Airborne Precision Spacing Concepts<br>Author: Stephen Eisenhawer, President, Logic Evolved Technologies, Inc., P.O. Box 1807, Santa Fe, NM, United States of America, seisenhawer@logicevolved.com<br>Coauthor(s): Terry Bott, John Foggia, Michael Sorokach, Sherilyn Brown<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Many factors: alternative systems, CONOPS and accident sequences are considered in evaluating a concept for Next Generation Air Space. Combination of factors results in many possibilities. Logic Evolved Decision analysis uses Logic Gate Models to represent possibilities in compact form. An LED study of Airborne Precision Spacing, used to control the spacing of aircraft on the final approach was performed. The results of the study show how an LGM integrates elements of risk and systems analysis.
