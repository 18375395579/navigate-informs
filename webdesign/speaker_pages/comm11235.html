<br>Title: Modelling Peer-to-Peer File Dissemination</br><br>Author: Mortada Mehyar, Caltech, 256-80 Caltech, Pasadena, CA, 91106, United States, morr@caltech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei-Hsin Gu, Lachlan Andrew, Steven Low</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We investigate a model for peer-to-peer file sharing. The goal is to distribute a file from a server to multiple peers. Each peer has limited upload capacity and can upload previously downloaded pieces to other peers. We examine the finish times of peers under different transmission strategies. Pareto optimality, min-max finish time, and optimal average finish time of the model are studied. We believe the model provides insights into practical peer-to-peer systems such as Bittorrent.</br>
