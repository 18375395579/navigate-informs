Title: Decreasing Future Donor Liver Discard via Procurement Strategies for Donation after Cardiac Death<br>Author: Maria Mayorga, Clemson University, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, mayorga@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hector Toro-Diaz, Eric Orman, Stephanie Wheeler, A. Sidney Barritt<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database, predictions show that organ utilization will continue to decline due to donor liver quality.  This is due not only to forecasted trends in the donor population (obesity, older donor age) but also in part to the acceptance of organs from donation after cardiac death which are associated with a high rate of discard.  Different procurement strategies are evaluated using simulation to predict the effect on liver transplants through 2030.
