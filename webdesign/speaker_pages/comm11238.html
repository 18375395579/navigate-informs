Title: Dynamic and Data-Driven Inventory Management Under Uncertainty<br>Author: Aurelie Thiele, P.C. Rossin Assistant Professor, Lehigh University, 200 W. Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, aut204@lehigh.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a framework based on dynamic and data-driven optimization to incorporate demand uncertainty. The approach is based on the monitoring of the actual demand and the decision-maker's ability to address sudden changes quickly, for instance by increasing the frequency of the observations and tracking additional quantities such as demand for other products or at other stores. We provide theoretical insights on the optimal solution and illustrate our findings on a numerical example.
