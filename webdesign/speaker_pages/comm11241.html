Title: System-Level Bridge Management Policies with Feedback Control<br>Author: Haotian Liu, PhD Candidate, University of California, Berkeley, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, liuht05@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samer Madanat<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In bridge management, empirically estimated models sometimes yield poor prediction due to data availability and quality, and conqsequently incur significant costs in policy decision-making. This research presents an Open-Loop Feedback Control approach which successively updates deterioration models as new data becomes available. We expect cost savings as opposed to Open-Loop optimization. Data is sourced from FHWA's NBI database.
