Most previous works considered them as genre, cast or director. But they were superficial and had limitations to show the nature of contents. In this study, we proposed hybrid approach for recommendation. And the contents similarity was calculated with the extracted features from online reviews of the content after latent semantic analysis had been applied. We compared the performance measure to other methods in the conclusion.</br>
