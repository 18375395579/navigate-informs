We develop an algorithm that adaptively identifies the set of keywords to bid on based on historical performance. The algorithm prioritizes keywords based on a prefix ordering -- sorting of keywords in a descending order of profit-to-cost ratio. We show that the average expected profit generated by the algorithm converges to near-optimal profits.
