<br>Title: An Adaptive Algorithm for Selecting Profitable Keywords for Search-Based Advertising Services</br><br>Author: Paat Rusmevichientong, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, 221 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States, paatrus@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Williamson</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of identifying profitable keywords, we formulate a model of keyword selection for search-based advertising. We develop an algorithm that adaptively identifies the set of keywords to bid on based on historical performance. The algorithm prioritizes keywords based on a prefix ordering -- sorting of keywords in a descending order of profit-to-cost ratio. We show that the average expected profit generated by the algorithm converges to near-optimal profits.</br>
