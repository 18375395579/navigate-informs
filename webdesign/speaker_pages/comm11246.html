Title: A LASSO-Based Diagnostic Framework for Multivariate Statistical Process Control<br>Author: Wei Jiang, Professor, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Antai College of Economics & Management, Shanghai, China, jiangwei@sjtu.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Fugee Tsung, Changliang Zou<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Accurate fault diagnosis of responsible factors has become increasingly critical in a variety of applications. Conventional statistical process control (SPC) methods are often computationally expensive. We frame fault isolation as a two-sample variable selection problem to provide a unified diagnosis framework based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC). A practical LASSO-based diagnostic procedure is proposed which combines BIC with the popular adaptive LASSO variable selection method.
