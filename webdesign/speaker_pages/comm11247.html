<br>Title: Decision Modeling for Vacant Lot Acquisition and Redevelopment</br><br>Author: Michael Johnson, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Boston, Dept of Public Policy & Public Affairs, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA, 02125, United States of America, michael.johnson@umb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alma Hallulli, Justin Hollander</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Cities facing disinvestment and population loss must decide how to assemble and manage large inventories of vacant lots. We develop decision models for parcel acquisition and redevelopment, with a focus on non-residential uses such as urban farming, stormwater management and community gardens. Our model’s goals include reducing measures of neighborhood distress, supporting environmental mitigation and ensuring political and social feasibility. We apply our model to data from Baltimore, MD.</br>
