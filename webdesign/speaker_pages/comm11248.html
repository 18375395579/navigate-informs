Title: Approximation Metaheuristics for Assortment Problems with Multiple Quality Levels<br>Author: Mark McElreath, Research Assistant, Clemson University, 110 Freeman Hall, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, 29634-0920, United States of America, mmcelre@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Maria Mayorga, Mary Beth Kurz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: While research on assortment planning has yielded useful analytical results, it has also left open computational questions.  In particular, when products are differentiated both horizontally and vertically the optimal solution has only been partially characterized.  We investigate three metaheuristics (using a common representation) and evaluate performance over several problem instances.
