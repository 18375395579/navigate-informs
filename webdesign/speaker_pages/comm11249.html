Title: Offer or No Offer: Managing Foreclosed Housing Acquisitions in Societal Response to Foreclosures<br>Author: Armagan Bayram, Doctoral Candidate, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, abayram@som.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Senay Solak<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider two practical decision frameworks for community development corporations (CDCs) in acquiring and redeveloping foreclosed properties. For both cases we derive analytical results and calculate optimal property value impact thresholds that a CDC can use to determine the properties to seek funding for. We also emphasize several insights based on a numerical study involving a CDC.
