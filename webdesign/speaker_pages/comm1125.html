The link travel time aggregation used in these calculations is usually chosen based on computational performance considerations.  This work explores the impacts of such discretization on DTA model convergence and results.  Our conclusions may be used to assess the importance of adopting more efficient TDSP algorithms in large-scale DTA implementations.</br>
