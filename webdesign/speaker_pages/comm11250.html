<br>Title: Call Center Modeling: A Bayesian State Space Approach</br><br>Author: Tevfik Aktekin, Department of Decision Sciences, Funger, 2201 G Street, NW, Washington, 20052, United States of America, taktekin@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Refik Soyer</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider an extension of state space models proposed by Weinberg et al. (2006) for daily call arrivals with  changing rates. We introduce a Bayesian Poisson state space model on the the original count data and develop sequential inference for the model. In so doing, we discuss computational issues associated with sequential updating of the model parameters and provide one day ahead predictive distributions for the daily call arrivals.</br>
