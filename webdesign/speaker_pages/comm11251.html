Often, the methods use a background model of independent bases. At least two different Markov background models have been proposed with the aim of increasing the accuracy of predicting regulatory elements. Both Markov background models suffer theoretical drawbacks. I discuss a new a ontext dependent Markov background model from fundamental statistical principles.</br>
