Title: A Bayesian Approach for the Registration of High-resolution NMR<br>Author: Seoung Bum Kim, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Arlington, 420K Woolf Hall, Arlington, TX, 76001, United States of America, sbkim@uta.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a new registration method for high-resolution NMR spectra  within the Bayesian modeling framework. The proposed method allows us to  estimate the amplitude and phase shifts simultaneously and to obtain  robust in the existence of noise.
