Title: Comparing Two Systems: Beyond Common Random Numbers<br>Author: Shane G. Henderson, Associate Professor, Cornell University, 230 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, sgh9@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samuel M. T. Ehrlichman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Suppose one is comparing 2 closely related stochastic systems via simulation. Common-random numbers (CRN) involves using the same streams of uniform random variables on both systems to sharpen the comparison. One can view CRN as a special choice of copula that gives the joint distribution on the inputs to both systems. We discuss the possibility of using more general copulae, including simple examples that show why this can outperform  CRN.
