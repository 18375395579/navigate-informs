<br>Title: Robust Synthesis of Nanostructures</br><br>Author: Tirthankar Dasgupta, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, tdasgupt@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Ma, Roshan Vengazhiyil, Zhong Lin Wang, Jeff C. F. Wu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: An effort is made to systematically investigate the best process conditions that ensure large-scale synthesis of different types of nanostructures. Models linking the probabilities of obtaining specific morphologies to the process variables are developed. A new iterative algorithm for fitting a Multinomial GLM is proposed and used. The optimum process conditions that are robust with respect to inner noise are derived from the fitted models using Monte-Carlo simulations.</br>
