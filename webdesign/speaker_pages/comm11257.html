Roosevelt St., Apt.8, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, sjweng64@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Teresa Wu, Gerald Mackulak, William Verdini<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: It is widely believed that the inefficiency of healthcare institutions contributes to high healthcare expenditures. This study proposes a bi-level distributed framework to improve resource allocation and thereby improve hospital operation efficiency. The proposed framework integrates Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine efficient staffing of hospitals based on a budget allocation from headquarters.
