Title: Explicit Solutions and Other Properties of Successively Lumpable Quasi Skip Free Processes<br>Author: Laurens Smit, Rutgers University and Leiden University, 1 Washington Park, Newark, NJ, United States of America, lcs116@pegasus.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Flora Spieksma, Michael Katehakis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the class of Quasi-skip-free processes (QSF), a generalization of the quasi-birth-and-death processes. We use a simple condition under which a QSF is successively lumpable (SL-QSF) and the steady state distribution can be calculated explicitly and rapidly.  We use this property to derive explicit solutions for the steady state probabilities of queueing models as the priority queue and the longest queue model. We discuss the benefits of using successive lumping over existing methods.
