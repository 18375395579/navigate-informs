<br>Title: Detection and Estimation of a Mixture in a Power Law Process for a Repairable System</br><br>Author: Paul Kvam, Professor, Georgia Tech, Industrial & Systems Eng., Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, paul.kvam@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a procedure for detecting and estimating a mixture  of conforming and nonconforming systems. The test of a mixture,  based on a simple likelihood ratio, is illustrated with truncated  failure data for copy machines. Bootstrap methods are used to  gauge the estimation uncertainty, and optimal decisions for system  replacement are determined based on the observed likelihood.</br>
