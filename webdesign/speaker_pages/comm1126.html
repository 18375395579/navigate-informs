In the real world obtaining data from a client and then processing it is fraught with many pitfalls. We describe our experiences in guiding students in a) identifying the available data, b) requesting the data, c) assessing the quality and completeness of the data d) linking together multiple data files, e) submitting a revised request for data and e) dealing with missing data, inaccurate data, and outliers. This iterative process usually takes months.</br>
