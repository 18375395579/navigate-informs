Title: Jumps in Equity Returns before and after the Financial Crisis<br>Author: Haowen Zhong, Columbia University, Room 350, Mudd Building, New York, United States of America, hz2193@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Kou, Cindy Yu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We find that a simple AJD model fits equity daily return data well; the model outperforms models with Levy jumps during the crisis, and is at least as good before the crisis. Based on the model and the data sets, we conclude that: (i) Jump rates increased significantly during the financial crisis, while there is little evidence that jump sizes  have changed. (ii) The empirical evidence favors finite number of large jumps in equity returns.
