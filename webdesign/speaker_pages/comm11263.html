In research, conventional models used today to strategize for an evacuation are often heavily dependent on behavioral assumptions, generating non-robust solutions.  We propose an innovative approach to modeling a city evacuation process that can produce robust solutions.  These solutions have the potential to lend insight for the development of simple, decentralized strategies for evacuation.</br>
