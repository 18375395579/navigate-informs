Title: Searching for Parking on a Network: A Stochastic Shortest Path Approach<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas, Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sadeq Safaripoor<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Parking is a significant component of any urban transportation system. This presentation introduces a network-based parking search model in a stochastic environment, along with a multi-user equilibrium formulation with recourse.  This formulation can be used to predict the impact of changes in parking pricing or availability policies, or the introduction of parking information systems.
