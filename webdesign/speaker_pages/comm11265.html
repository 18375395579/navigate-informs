Title: Lagrangian-based Hydrodynamic Model: Highway Traffic Estimation<br>Author: Tao Yao, Pennsylvania State University, 349 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, taoyao@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ke Han, Terry Friesz<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The widely studied Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model is formulated in Eulerian coordinate system. We formulate the LWR model in the Lagrangian coordinates and propose a numerical algorithm for solving the PDE with multiple value conditions. This is applied to highway mobile sensing, data fusing and traffic estimation.
