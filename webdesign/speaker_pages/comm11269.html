The objective is to achieve a high average throughput while maintaining the probability of congestion-induced collapse under an acceptable threshold. Our methodology involves the transient analysis of a serial queueing model, approximate dynamic programming, and simulation. This applied study was conducted in collaboration with an industrial partner.</br>
