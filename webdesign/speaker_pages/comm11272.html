In contrast with the traditional approaches, which employ a margin around the clinical target, our optimization is based on a finite number of generated scenarios, where each daily treatment (fraction) can be viewed as a realization. We test the efficacy and efficiency of our model, as well as the effect of the number of scenarios, using clinical data.
