Title: Accelerated Destructive Degradation Test: Data Analysis and Test Planning<br>Author: Yili Hong, Assistant Professor, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States of America, yilihong@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Caleb King<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Accelerated destructive degradation tests (ADDTs) are often used to obtain material reliability information. The current industrial standard analysis uses a two-step approach. An alternative is the ADDT analysis approach which models degradation path as a function of time and temperature. We investigate the pros and cons of both approaches and use simulations to study the performance of the standard method. Statistically efficient and robust test planning procedures will also be discussed.
