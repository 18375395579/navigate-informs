Title: Dynamic Price Forecasts in Online Auction Using Functional Models<br>Author: Wolfgang Jank, Assistant Professor, University of Maryland, 4322 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, wjank@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Galit Shmueli, Shanshan Wang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Online auctions are so plentiful that it is hard to decide which auction to bid on. One step into alleviating this decision is to offer dynamic price predictions. We develop a dynamic model for price using functional data analysis. The model is dynamic in that it operates in the ongoing auction. The use of functional data analysis allows the incorporation of price dynamics such as the price velocity and acceleration. We illustrate our approach on a diverse set of eBay auctions.
