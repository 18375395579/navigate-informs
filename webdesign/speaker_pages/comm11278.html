<br>Title: Stochastic Patient-centered Long-term Care Network Design</br><br>Author: Leyla Ozsen, San Francisco State University, 1600 Holloway Ave., San Francisco, CA, United States of America, lozsen@sfsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Intrevado</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A multistage stochastic network facility model for long-term care is presented as a mixed-integer program, capturing patient quality-of-life. Stochastic patient flows and demands are examined. An illustrative example based on empirical data is presented and results discussed.</br>
