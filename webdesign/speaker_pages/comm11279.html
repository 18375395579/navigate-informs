Title: A Bayesian Graphical Generalization for the Black-Litterman Model<br>Author: Shea Chen, University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, shea.chen@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Lim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In finance, the Black-Litterman model is a Bayesian method used to combine investor opinions with the market portfolio to obtain an estimate for the future returns of assets. We generalize the Black-Litterman model to account for uncertainty in the investor and the market equilibrium estimate. The posterior distribution of this model is difficult to obtain analytically, but can be sampled using Gibbs' sampling. This method can yield Markowitz portfolios that are robust to inaccuracies in the Black-Litterman model, such as investor bias or incorrect market portfolios.
