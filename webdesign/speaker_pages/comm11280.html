In this research, Petri nets have been implemented for modeling classic network reliability problems. Moreover, based on the results obtained, data mining has been used to propose a lower bound for network reliability. This technique allows for the evaluation of reliability without the need to resort to simulation whenever changes in the reliability of network components occur.
