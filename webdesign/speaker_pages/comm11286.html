Title: Computationally Efficient use of Derivatives in Emulation of Complex Computational Models<br>Author: Brian Williams, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Bikini Atoll Road; MS F600, Los Alamos, United States of America, brianw@lanl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Marcy<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We will investigate the use of derivative information in complex computer model emulation when the correlation function is of the compactly supported Bohman class.  To this end, a Gaussian process model similar to that used by Kaufman et al. (2011) is extended to a situation where first partial derivatives in each dimension are calculated at each input site (i.e. using gradients).  The efficacy of the proposed method is studied via simulation and a nuclear reactor code.
