<br>Title: On Threshold Models over Finite Networks</br><br>Author: Elie Adam, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, eadam@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Munther Dahleh, Asuman Ozdaglar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a model for cascade effects over finite networks based on a deterministic binary linear threshold model. We first characterize the limiting behavioral properties of the dynamics. We then study the complexity of decision/counting problems that arise within the context. We finally propose a measure of network resilience that captures the nature of the involved dynamics, prove bounds and investigate the resilience of different network structures under this measure.</br>
