Title: DEXES-II: An Alternative to Agent-Based Spatial Modeling of Societal Response<br>Author: Loren Cobb, Associate Research Professor, University of Colorado Denver, Dept of Mathematics, Campus Box 170, PO Box 173364, Denver, CO, 80217-3364, United States of America, cobb@Aetheling.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: DEXES-II is a simulation model developed for large-scale civil-military exercises in peacekeeping, disaster relief, and complex humanitarian emergencies. Since 1994, DEXES models have employed spatially-distributed variables for social, economic, political, and health conditions, including refugee dynamics, public opinion, ethnic conflict, and pandemic disease. Unlike DEXES-I, the current DEXES-II version is completely free of agents. The DEXES model approach and its pros and cons are discussed.
