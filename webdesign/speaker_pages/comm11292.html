Title: Manufacturing Line Design for Product Variety Considering Line Flexibility and Task Similarity<br>Author: Jeonghan Ko, University of Michigan, 2350 HAYWARD ST., 2250 G.G. BROWN, Mechanical Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, jeonghan@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jack Hu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Classical approaches to manufacturing line design have usually concerned serial configurations of identical machines. We developed mixed integer programming models for maximizing (1) cost-effectiveness of line configurations for multiple product models by the appropriate combinations of dedicated and flexible machines, and (2) the similarity of manufacturing tasks assigned to a machine for different product models.
