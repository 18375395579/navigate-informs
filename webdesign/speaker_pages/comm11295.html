<br>Title: A Data-driven Characterization of Residential Energy Consumption</br><br>Author: Adrian Albert, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, 350 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, adalbert@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop  a dynamic model of residential energy consumption driven by “occupancy states?reflecting structurally different regimes of energy use driven by user presence and activity level such as  the use of large appliances (heating, cooling). We learn individual household occupancy models from hourly data for 120,000 energy users in CA. We argue that an understanding of occupancy patterns  may be used for targeting Demand-Response programs (e.g., load curtailing) to the right consumers.</br>
