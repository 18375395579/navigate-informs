<br>Title: A Deployed Quantal Response Based Patrol Planning System for the US Coast Guard</br><br>Author: Fernando Ordonez, Universidad de Chile, Department of Industrial Engineering, Santiago, Chile, fordon@dii.uchile.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Milind Tambe, Eric Shieh, Rong Yang, Craig Baldwin, Bo An, Joseph DiRenzo, Garrett Meyer, Ben Maule</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we describe the model, theory developed and deployment of PROTECT, a game-theoretic system in use by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in the Port of Boston for scheduling patrols. The PROTECT system is premised on an attacker-defender Stackelberg game model but its development and implementation required both theoretical contributions and detailed evaluations. The USCG evaluated the deployment of PROTECT in the Port of Boston as a success and is currently evaluating the system in the Port of New York, with the potential for nationwide deployment.</br>
