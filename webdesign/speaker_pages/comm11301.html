Venkateshwar Rao, Sabre Airline Solutions, 3150 Sabre Drive, Southlake, TX, 76092, beju.rao@sabre.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Bookings data observed in a revenue management environment is not the true underlying demand.  Passengers often end up booking on flights that are not their first preference, due to capacity and/or fare class availability restrictions. Spilled demand from a closed fare classes is either sold up to a higher fare class, or recaptured on other flights.  We present a customer choice model based framework for obtaining the first choice, untruncated demands for various services at different fare values. The forecasting methodology is applicable in restriction free pricing as well as in traditional environments.  We provide measures to evaluate forecast accuracy. We discuss benefits associated with a choice based forecasting as well as challenges associated with the implementation.</br>
