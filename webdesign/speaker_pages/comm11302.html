Title: Beyond Optimization: Integrating Knowledge Representation into Intelligent Service Oriented Systems<br>Author: Robin Burk, Assistant Professor, US Military Academy, D/EECS, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, robin.burk@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Niki Goerger, Buhrman Gates, Curt Blais, Joyce Nagle, LTC Robert Kewley<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The rise of service oriented software architectures and formal  ontologies presents an opportunity for integration of previously standalone optimization and other models into enterprise-wide systems. This paper describes a service which links the Army's Mobility Common Operational Picture data model and ontology with a network flow optimization application, a command and control system, and a discrete event simulation to explore intelligent route finding in response to unexpected events.
