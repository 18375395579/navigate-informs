Title: Wavelet-Based Distribution-Free Tabular CUSUM Chart<br>Author: Joongsup (Jay) Lee, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, jlee@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Youngmi Hur, Seong-Hee Kim, James Wilson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose two wavelet-based distribution-free tabular CUSUM procedures for detecting shifts in the mean of a multivariate process. Each procedure uses a reduced vector of components derived from the discrete wavelet transform; from Phase I, each procedure estimates the required parameters of a CUSUM chart to be used for monitoring in Phase II. Preliminary experimentation shows that both charts outperform multivariate Shewhart-type charts in various types of test processes.
