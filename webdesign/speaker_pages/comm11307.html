<br>Title: Queuing Network Models for Cycle Times of Autonomous Vehicle based Storage and Retrieval Systems</br><br>Author: Ananth Krishnamurthy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, ME 3258 Department of ISyE, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, ananth@engr.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Li Zhang, Charles Malmborg, Sunderesh Heragu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval System (AVSRS) are a relatively new technology. AVSR systems use vehicles and lifts for horizontal and vertical movements respectively. We propose a new class of queuing network models for AVSR systems that uses fork/join synchronization stations to precisely model transaction, vehicles and lift interactions.</br>
