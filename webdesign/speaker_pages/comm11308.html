Title: Balancing Responsiveness and Efficiency with Flexibility in the Emergency Department<br>Author: Lauren Laker, University of Cincinnati, 534 Lindner Hall, Cincinnati, OH, 45220, United States of America, lakerln@mail.uc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Craig Froehle, Christopher Lindsell, Michael Ward<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We evaluate the effects on wait time and utilization of flexible partitioning between low & high-acuity areas in an Emergency Department.  The results of discrete-event simulation modeling show that introducing flexible rooms, accessible by both low & high-acuity patients, provides substantial operational benefits for ED performance including lower wait times and balanced bed utilization. Furthermore, the optimal policy is shown to be robust to changes in patient mix, volume, and service times.
