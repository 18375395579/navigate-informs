<br>Title: Process Monitoring of Ultra Precision Machining (UPM) using Evidence Theory based Sensor Fusion</br><br>Author: Omer Beyca, Ph.D. Student/Research Associate, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74074, United States of America, omer.beyca@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhenyu (James) Kong, Satish Bukkapatnam</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Surface integrity is vital for Ultra Precision Machining (UPM) processes. Therefore monitoring the UPM process is crucial to detect the process anomalies at their early stages, and thus, to improve surface integrity. In this study we developed a Dirichlet process based sensor fusion method for UPM process monitoring. The case study demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing process variability in the UPM.</br>
