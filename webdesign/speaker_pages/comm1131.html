Title: Corporate Bond Portfolio Optimization with Transaction Costs<br>Author: Peter Meindl, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, 1038 Guinda Street, Palo Alto, CA, 94301, United States, Meindl@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Primbs<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a methodology for corporate bond portfolio optimization in a multi-period environment with transaction costs. Our methodology melds stochastic programming with receding horizon control, essentially breaking down the portfolio optimization problem into a sequence of problems solved over time. Through Monte Carlo simulation of reduced form defaultable bonds, we demonstrate results showing our methodology can significantly outperform other methodologies.
