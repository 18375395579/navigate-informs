Title: Analyzing the Control of Mosquito-borne Diseases by a Dominant Lethal Genetic System<br>Author: Michael Atkinson, Institute for Computational and Mathemat, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, mpa33@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Coleman, Zheng Su, Nina Alphey, Luke Alphey, Lawrence Wein<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We formulate a model to assess the impact on the spread of  mosquito-borne diseases of a strategy that releases male insects homozygous for a lethal genetic trait. A dynamic model for the female mosquito population, which incorporates the competition for female mating between released mosquitoes and wild mosquitoes,  density-dependent competition during the larval stage, and realization  of the lethal trait either before or after the larval stage, is embedded  into a human-vector epidemic model.
