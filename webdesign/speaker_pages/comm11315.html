<br>Title: Recommendations for Modeling Crisis Response in Public Health and Medicine</br><br>Author: Margaret Brandeau, Professor, Stanford University, MS&E Department, Terman Building, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, brandeau@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dena Bravata, Nathaniel Hupert, Jon-Erik Holty, Jessica McCoy</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The field of emergency response modeling lacks a coherent organization that could facilitate the systematic reporting of model inputs and results, and promote the use of standard methodological approaches. We describe the types of models that have been developed to evaluate crisis threats to public health and potential responses, and present recommendations for conducting and reporting the results of these models in the future.</br>
