<br>Title: Information Acquisition in Cost Sensitive Environments</br><br>Author: Maytal Saar-Tsechansky, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, Maytal.Saar-Tsechansky@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: As a data-driven paradigm data mining relies on the availability of data to derive patterns. Traditional data mining and machine learning does not consider acquisition of information that can be used for pattern induction or inference. In many applications, however, the traditional scenario is too simplistic. The talk discusses recent work on information acquisition policies designed to improve a variety of objectives including prediction accuracy and other decision tasks.</br>
