<br>Title: Quality Improvement in Battery Manufacturing through Selective Assembly</br><br>Author: Feng Ju, University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, fju2@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jingshan Li</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This article studies selective assembly for a two-component assembly system with finite buffers, where each component can exhibit different quality behaviors. Such a model is applicable to battery assembly process to improve quality. Analytical methods based on a two-level decomposition procedure are developed to evaluate the system performance, and the estimation accuracy is justified numerically. In addition, structure properties are investigated to provide insights on performance improvement.</br>
