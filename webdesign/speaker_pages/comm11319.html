In the model, both short and medium term impacts of the possible attack are considered. The medium term impacts are examined by the interdicted DC OPF model. The short term impacts are assessed by a cascading outage analysis model. An improved integer programming heuristic is applied to solve the problem. The proposed model has been verified using the IEEE Test Systems.</br>
