Title: Adaptive Route Choice Models: Specification, Choice Set Generation, and Estimation<br>Author: Jing Ding, Research Assistant, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 130 Natural Resources Rd, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, ding@engin.umass.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a modelling framework for adaptive route choice based on vehicle trajectory data in a general stochastic time-dependent network, here a traveler could revise route choice based upon real-time traffic information. We demonstrate the model specification, choice set generation algorithm, and estimation process in a large real-life network using synthetic data.
