Title: Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks in Mammalian Cells<br>Author: Vesteinn Thorsson, Senior Research Scientist, Institute for Systems Biology, 1441 North 34th Street, Seattle, WA, 98103-8904, United States of America, thorsson@systemsbiology.org<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Statistical methods for variable selection show promise in revealing the complex networks that underlie gene transcription in unicellular organisms (R. Bonneau, INFORMS 2007;D. Reiss, INFORMS 2007).  The resulting gene regulatory network models indicate that systemic responses to environmental changes may be predictable.  We discuss challenges in generalizing these methods to mammalian cells, and evaluate predictions for macrophages, which form an essential component of the innate immune system.
