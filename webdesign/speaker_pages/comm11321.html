Title: State Processes and their Role in Design and Implementation of Financial Models<br>Author: Dmitry Kramkov, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15217, United States, kramkov@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We evaluate on state processes and their role in design and implementation of financial models.
