Title: Capacity Booking in a Transportation Network with Stochastic Demand and a  Secondary Market for Transportation Capacity<br>Author: Asgeir Tomasgard, Dr, NTNU, Gloeshaugen, Trondheim, NA, 7491, Norway, asgeir.tomasgard@iot.ntnu.no<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present an equilibrium model for transport booking in a gas  transportation network. The booking regime is similar to the regime  implemented in the North-Sea. The model looks at the challenges faced by the  network operator in regulating such a system. There are some privileged  players in the network, with access to a primary market for transportation  capacity. The demand for capacity is stochastic when the booking in the  primary market is done. There is also an open secondary market for  transportation capacity where all players participate including a  competitive fringe. We consider different objective functions for the  network operator, and the difference between setting fixed capacities and  modeling the pressure constraints in a sub-sea pipeline-network. This is  modelled as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium using a stochastic  complementarity problem where each players optimization problem is a  stochastic program.
