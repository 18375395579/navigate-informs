Title: Monitoring CMP Process by Particle Filtering through Parameter Estimation and Prediction<br>Author: Zhenyu (James) Kong, Assistant Professor, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, james.kong@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam, Ranga Komanduri<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) has been widely used in semiconductor manufacturing industry to polish surface of wafers with more planarity. This paper proposes a method of online dynamic modeling to estimate and predict process state parameters, and further predict MRR. The fundamental challenge of this task is the non-linear nature of the CMP processes. This challenge is tackled by applying particle filtering method, to capture the non-linear dynamic of the CMP process.
