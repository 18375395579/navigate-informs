Title: Real-Time Inter-Modal Substitution as an Airport Congestion Management Strategy<br>Author: Mark Hansen, Professor, University of California at Berkeley, Civil and Environmental Engineering, 114 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, mhansen@ce.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yu Zhang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We explore the potential for inter-modal substitution to reduce flight traffic and delays when there is a temporary shortfall in airport capacity. In our scheme, airlines cancel short-haul flights and rebook passengers on surface transport modes when delay savings from reduced flight traffic justify this. We demonstrate an optimization model that chooses which flights to cancel, as well as a more complex model that considers missed connections, surface vehicle routing, and other issues.
