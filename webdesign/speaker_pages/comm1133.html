Title: Two-stage Controlled Fractional Factorial Screening for Simulation Experiments<br>Author: Bruce Ankenman, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd., Evanston, IL, United States, ankenman@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hong Wan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Factor screening with statistical control of Type I error and Power makes sense for simulation experiments since they have random error, but can be run automatically.  Here, a fractional factorial design in combination with a two-stage procedure for controlling power is proposed and compared to other available methods.
