To incorporate the impact of airline pricing and RM and reconstruct the traveler’s choice set, booking data is combined with fare rules and seat availability data. In addition, characteristics of the traveler and the trip are retrieved and used to estimate a latent class choice model providing an alternative to the traditional segmentation based on trip purpose.
