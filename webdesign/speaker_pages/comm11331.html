<br>Title: Statistical Adjustments to Engineering Models with Applications to Machining</br><br>Author: Roshan Josep Vengazhiyil, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, roshan@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shreyes Melkote</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A common problem in engineering is that the models developed based on the underlying physics of the process do not always match satisfactorily with reality. This work proposes engineering-statistical models that combine the advantages of engineering models and statistical models. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated using the prediction of surface roughness in a micro-cutting process and the optimization of a laser assisted mechanical micromachining process.</br>
