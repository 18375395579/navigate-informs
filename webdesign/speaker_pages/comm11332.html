Title: A Dynamic Programming Model for Optimal Sensor Placement for Providing Travel Times<br>Author: Xuegang (Jeff) Ban, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th St, JEC 4034, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, banx@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alexandre Bayen, Ryan Herring, JD Margulici<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a dynamic programming model to determine the optimal sensor locations for providing freeway travel times. The model is tested using both microsimulation data and GPS-equipped cellular phone data for real-world transportation corridors.
