<br>Title: Expert Queues: Information Pricing and Congestion</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Associate Professor, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street Suite 550, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mehmet Fazil Pac</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Consumers cannot identify their problems often (for e.g. car repair).  Therefore they rely on experts, who also provide the service, for the diagnosis of their problems. The information asymmetry arising upon diagnosis leads to inefficiencies in service provision. The expert has an incentive to over-provide or to ration services, based on the demand, capacity and the consumer waiting costs. We investigate diagnosis and pricing decisions in expert service markets using a queuing framework.</br>
