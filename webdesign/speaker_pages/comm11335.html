Title: Modeling Handling Operations in Retail Stores: An Empirical Analysis<br>Author: Tom Van Woensel, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, PO Box 513, Pav F5, Eindhoven, 5600 MB, Netherlands, t.v.woensel@tm.tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Alina Curseu, Jan Fransoo, Karel van Donselaar, Rob Broekmeulen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present an empirical study of the shelf-stacking process in retail stores to investigate the main factors affecting the execution time. We examine the complete process at the level of individual sub-activities and derive a simple prediction model, on the basis of the number of case packs and consumer units. The model is tested and validated using real-life data from two European retailers.
