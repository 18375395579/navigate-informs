Title: Bayesian Sequential Change Detection and Identification<br>Author: Savas Dayanik, Assistant Professor, Princeton University, Engineering Quadrangle, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, sdayanik@Princeton.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Christian Goulding<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The problem of detection and identification of an unobservable  change in the distribution of a random sequence is formulated via a  hidden Markov model approach.  The formulation is Bayesian, on-line,  discrete-time, allowing multiple disorders with dependent  observations, statistical dependencies between the change-time and  change-type, and general discrete-time disorder distributions.  Optimality results and numerical examples will be given.
