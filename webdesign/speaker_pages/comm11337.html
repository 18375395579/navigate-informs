<br>Title: Probabilistic Forecasting at FAA's Commercial Terminals</br><br>Author: Dipasis Bhadra, Principal Economist, MITRE/CAASD, 7515 Colshire Avenue, McLean, VA, 22102, United States, dbhadra@mitre.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roger Schaufele</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Generally, speaking, activities forecasts are point forecasts. This is true at the FAA as well as many other parts of the federal government. In this talk, we lay out a framework within which forecasts can be made probabilistic with uncertainty bands around them when the underlying model is unknown. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we apply this framework on total operations at FAA's commercial terminals.</br>
