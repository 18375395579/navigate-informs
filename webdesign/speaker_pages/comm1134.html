Title: Agent-based Simulation of Healthcare Systems with Real-time Data Feeding<br>Author: Xueping Li, University of Tennessee, 408 East Stadium Hall, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States of America, Xueping.Li@utk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tom Berg, Joe Wilck<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Real-time location services (RTLS), such as Wifi-based RFIDs, have attracted increasing interest in healthcare systems. We present the simulation models that we developed for the Y-12 Occupational Health Services (OHS) clinic in which we use agents to fetch sensor data and feed the models in real time. A management system was developed to assist the end-users with a dashboard system to provide real-time system status. Optimization and predictive modeling functions were integrated in the system.
