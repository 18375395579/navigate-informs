<br>Title: How Much Does it Pay to Use Models for Affordable Housing Development?</br><br>Author: Michael Johnson, Extern, Carnegie Mellon University, Center for Economic Development, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, United States, johnson2@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Math programming models for affordable housing development choose the size and location of housing to optimize social welfare and equity objectives. In this paper data from an affordable housing provider is used to create more accurate estimates of social benefits and costs and validate current planning models. The current configuration of the provider's affordable housing stock is shown to be suboptimal. Substantial social returns may be associated with the use of prescriptive planning models.</br>
