Title: Scalable Latent Space Models for Social Networking Data using Dirichlet Processes<br>Author: Michael Braun, Assistant Professor of Markting, MIT Sloan School of Management, 1 Amherst St., E40-169, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, braunm@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andre Bonfrer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Two of the challenges in working with dyadic social networking data are dealing with scalability (a dataset of N customers involves evaluating N-choose-2 likelihoods)  and unobserved heterogeneity.  We address both issues by “locating?each person on a latent social space, and modeling the distribution of locations as a mixture of Dirichlet processes.  We demonstrate the efficiency and utility of this model using call record data from more than 10,000 mobile phone users.
