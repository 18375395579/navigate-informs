Title: Multiscale Monitoring of Autocorrelated Processes using Wavelets Analysis<br>Author: Kamran Paynabar, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, kamip@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin, Huairui Guo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method to develop multiscale monitoring control charts for an autocorrelated process that has an underlying unknown ARMA (2,1) structure. The Haar wavelet transform is used to obtain effective monitoring statistics by considering the process dynamic characteristics in both time and frequency domains. Through several simulation scenarios, we show that proposed control charts outperform other existing charts in terms of detecting changes in an autocorrelated process.
