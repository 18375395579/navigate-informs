Title: The Role of Statistical Model-based Analytics in Biometric Authentication<br>Author: Sinjini Mitra, Assistant Professor, California State University, Fullerton, ISDS Department, 800 N State College Blvd, Fullerton, CA, 92831, United States of America, smitra@exchange.fullerton.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The use of biometric traits for security purposes is quite widespread today, from immigration and border control to access control in electronics, ATMS and e-commerce transactions. In this talk, I will point out some statistical issues underlying the method of biometric authentication that substantiate the need for detailed analytics, and briefly present a model-based approach for better performance evaluation of biometric systems. I will illustrate this with the help of a face biometric system.
