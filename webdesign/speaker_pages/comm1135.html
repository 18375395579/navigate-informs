Title: Mathematical Model for the Evaluation and Planning of Railroad Track Maintenance<br>Author: Alexander Lovett, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N Mathews Ave, B118 NCEL, MC-250, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, alovett2@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Barkan, Conrad Ruppert<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In order to reduce maintenance costs a mathematical model was developed to prioritize maintenance activities based on their cost and potential for risk reduction. The model has three components: degradation modeling, project evaluation, and optimization based on relative costs and benefits. The component formulation has the result of allowing for a conceptual development with simplified information that can be updated as new information becomes available.
