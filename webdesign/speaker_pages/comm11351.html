Title: A Combined Model of Classical and Impulse Controls for Emission and Stock Abatement Policies<br>Author: Akira Maeda, The University of Tokyo, maeda@global.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp<br>Coauthor(s): Motoh Tsujimura<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study investigates emission and stock abatement policy decisions by the use of a stochastic optimal control model. We begin with our discussion by applying an absolute continuous control to emission flow abatement and management. Then, we extend the model to a direct control of carbon stock. We introduce a specific feature of the cost structure for stock control and assume the cost function is described as a discontinuous and subadditive one. For this extension, we use an impulse control.
