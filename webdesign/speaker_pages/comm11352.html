Title: Simulation and Validation of Airport Capacity Models<br>Author: Amy Kim, University of California at Berkeley, NEXTOR, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, amy_kim@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: To improve the state-of-the-art, the development of a new airport capacity model is under consideration by the FAA; however, this requires a better understanding of existing models. To this end, runway operations at several airports were modeled using at least two computer capacity models. The goal is to compare simulated capacity results with one another, with estimated rates produced with empirical data, as well as with documented capacity values.
