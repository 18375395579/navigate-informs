Operation of the system is governed by complex contracts evolved over years. These are a challenge to model and require the use of binary variables. Moreover the infrastructure model is nonconvex. The overall program is a nonconvex MINLP and is solved with a global branch-and-reduce algorithm with customized heuristics.</br>
