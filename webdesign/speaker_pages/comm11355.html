Title: Parcel-level Redevelopment Strategies for Distressed Neighborhoods<br>Author: Michael Johnson, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Boston, Dept of Public Policy and Public Affairs, 100 Morrissey Blvd., Boston, MA, 0212503393, United States of America, michael.johnson@umb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Justin Hollander<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Certain distressed neighborhoods cannot support traditional residential-focused development.  For these communities, we develop decision models for acquisition and redevelopment of chronically vacant lands and structures for primarily non-residential and greening uses. We address social benefits and costs of redevelopment strategies, parcel clustering to exploit economies of scale, and conflicting values among various stakeholders. We illustrate our models using data from Baltimore, MD.
