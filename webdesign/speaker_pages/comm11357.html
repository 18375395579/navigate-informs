<br>Title: Building Customer Response Models from Transaction Data</br><br>Author: Dirk Beyer, Principal Scientist, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Road, MS 1140, Palo Alto, CA, 94598, United States, dirk.beyer@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Troy Shahoumian, Hsiu-Khuern Tang, Alex Zhang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In order to use transaction data as training data for customer response models, it needs to be transformed into records describing the state of a customer at the time of an interaction. In this talk, we are describing a solution that enables the user to easily describe the transformations desired without writing DB queries, to generate rich training dataset and to automatically build customer response models across different classes of models.</br>
