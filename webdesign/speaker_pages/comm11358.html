Title: Identifying the Time of Step Change in the Mean of an ARMA(1,1) Process<br>Author: Marcus Perry, Assistant Professor, Florida International University, 10555 West Flagler Street EC 3172, Miami, FL, 33174, United States, perrym@fiu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk, a maximum likelihood estimator for the time of step change in the mean of an ARMA(1,1) process is presented.  We outline the development of the estimator under the general ARIMA framework, and provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the application of the proposed estimator.  We also present results of a Monte Carlo simulation study used to evaluate the performance of the estimator following EWMAST control chart signals.
