Title: Benchmarking for Improving the Efficiency of In-country Organizations in Global Health Supply Chains<br>Author: Gemma Berenguer, Assistant professor, Purdue University, 403 W. State St., West Lafayette, In, 47907, United States of America, gemmabf@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Iyer, Prashant Yadav<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Many data streams are used to characterize global health supply chain performance. These data reflect both input and output measurements and the combined effect of these variables describes overall delivery efficiency. In addition, comparing performance with peer organizations facing similar challenges provides both the best representation of performance and facilitates performance improvement through benchmarking. We employ Data Envelopment Analysis tools to accomplish this benchmarking goal.
