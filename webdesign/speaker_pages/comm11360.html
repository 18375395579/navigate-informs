Title: Topology Control for Load Shed Recovery<br>Author: Adolfo Escobedo, Graduate Research Assistant, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, adolfoescobedo@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kory Hedman, Erick Moreno-Centeno<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We introduce the dc optimal load shed recovery with transmission switching model (DCOLSR-TS), which seeks to reduce potential post-contingency load shedding by modifying the system topology. Since solving DCOLSR-TS is computationally difficult, we develop a heuristic (MIP-H), which improves the system topology while specifying the sequence of switching operations.  We argue the use of a parallelized version of MIP-H for on-line load shed recovery and recurring contingency-response analysis.
