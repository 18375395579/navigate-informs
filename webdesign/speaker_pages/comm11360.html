Since solving DCOLSR-TS is computationally difficult, we develop a heuristic (MIP-H), which improves the system topology while specifying the sequence of switching operations.  We argue the use of a parallelized version of MIP-H for on-line load shed recovery and recurring contingency-response analysis.</br>
