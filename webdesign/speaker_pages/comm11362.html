Title: Desirability Functions in Multiresponse Optimization<br>Author: Gülser Köksal, Middle East Technical University, METU Industrial Engineering Department, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, koksal@metu.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Basak Akteke Ozturk, Gerhard Weber<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Desirability functions are widely used in optimization of multiple responses such as quality characteristics for robust products and processes.  In this study structural characteristics of desirability functions are analyzed for different types of responses and interactions among them.  Optimization approaches for multiresponse optimization models based on desirability functions are discussed, new methods are proposed and compared with each other.
