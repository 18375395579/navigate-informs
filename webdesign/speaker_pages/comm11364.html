Title: Poet: An Online Education Tool for Overcoming Student Difficulties with Optimization Modeling<br>Author: Sung-Hee Kim, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, kim731@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rachael H. Kenney, Nelson Uhan, Jikai Zou, Ji Soo Yi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: POET (Purdue Optimization model Education Tool) is a web-based visual interactive tool to help students form optimization models from word problems. We assessed its effectiveness with 79 engineering students in an undergraduate optimization course. Our pre- and post-test results show that POET did not drastically improve students?modeling skills,  but did help them avoid particular types of errors. We will present how instructors can use POET as a supplementary tool in an optimization class.
