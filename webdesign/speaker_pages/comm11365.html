Title: Informational Decision Trees<br>Author: Irad Ben-Gal, Dept. of Industrial Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, 69978, Israel, bengal@eng.tau.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Evgeni Kagan, Niv Shkolni<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We will discuss the Informational Decision Trees that locally optimizes the gain of information over a given set of selected features and can be used for Classification.    We use  a revised version of the LRTA*, a known artificial intelligence algorithm that was proposed for learning. Our model generalizes a wide range of classification algorithms. It enables to directly address the tradeoff between complexity and optimality.
