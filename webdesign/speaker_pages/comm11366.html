<br>Title: Mapping Engineering Defined Patterns with Factor Loadings for Variation Source Identification in MMP</br><br>Author: Jian Liu, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, IOE1710, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States, jliuzz@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jianjun Shi</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A new diagnosis methodology is proposed for identifying multiple process faults in multi-stage manufacturing processes (MMP).  Engineering knowledge represented as a pattern matrix is employed in directing the rotation of factor loadings, which are extracted from measurement covariance matrix, to estimate the true geometric relationships between process faults and quality variables.</br>
