Pre-designed standard response rules help shorten response reaction time by providing intuitive dispatch guidelines based on fire weather, ignition locations and local experience.  Stochastic optimization models provide a systematic and consistent way to evaluate existing standard response rules, compare it with perfect knowledge solutions, or to generate new and more efficient rules under possible fire scenarios. This study explores new knowledge in designing and implementing initial attack response rules.</br>
