We introduce a framework that combines many-server heavy-traffic analysis with the concept of $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium to obtain first-order and second-order characterization for the equilibria in this market. The framework allows us to go significantly beyond the tractability boundaries imposed by the regular Nash equilibrium analysis.</br>
