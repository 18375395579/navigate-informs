Title: Pricing and Dimensioning Competing Large-scale Service Providers<br>Author: Gad Allon, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, g-allon@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Itay Gurvich<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a market with several large-scale service-providers that compete on both prices and service-levels. We introduce a framework that combines many-server heavy-traffic analysis with the concept of $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium to obtain first-order and second-order characterization for the equilibria in this market. The framework allows us to go significantly beyond the tractability boundaries imposed by the regular Nash equilibrium analysis.
