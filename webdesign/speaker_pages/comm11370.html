Title: A Class of Flow Splitting Models for Day-to-Day Traffic Assignment<br>Author: Xiaozheng He, University of Minnesota, 500 Pillsbury Dr SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55414, United States of America, hexxx069@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Henry Liu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: While the development of splitting rate model (Smith and Mounce, 2011) overcomes the unrealism in path-based models, it contains an ad-hoc step of flow adjustment, for the purpose of maintaining the flow conservation. In this talk, we propose a general formulation for a class of flow splitting models, which endogenously preserves the flow conservation. We also analyze the asymptotic stability of a flow splitting model, when we specify the outflow splitting function as a projection operation.
