Title: Using the Repeated Two-sample Rank (RTR) Procedure for Detecting Anomalies in Space and Time<br>Author: Ronald Fricker, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Reaserch Dept, 1411 Cunningham Road, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, rdfricke@nps.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The RTR procedure is a  nonparametric statistical process control methodology.  The method transforms a sample of data into univariate statistics; changes in the distribution of the data are then detected using nonparametric rank tests.  In this discussion we explore its use as a spatio-temporal event detection and monitoring methodology.  Upon a signal of a possible distributional change, the methodology suggests a way to graphically indicate the likely location of the distributional change.
