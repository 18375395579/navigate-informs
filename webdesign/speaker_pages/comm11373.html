Title: Using Machine Learning to Understand Dynamics of Conflict<br>Author: Lujie Chen, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, lujiec@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Artur Dubrawski, Jen Ziemke<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We show how machine learning can be used for the enhanced analysis of real-time event data, using 10,000 micro-level time- and geo-referenced reports of battle and civilian massacre events recorded over the 41-year Angolan civil war as an example. Why combatants sometimes opt to avoid targeting civilians, whereas at other times and places, massacres are rife? Our research suggests a fruitful synergy between applied computational models and scholars working in the expanding spaces of social and political science being flooded with large volumes of real-time event-based data.
