These two products, which assist controllers and traffic managers with better forecasting capabilities, have been estimated to deliver benefits, i.e.,delay savings.    This paper overviews our validation using data analysis versus modeling. These data validations compare the difference in operational performance duing the pre-acquisition period and the post-acquisition period.</br>
