We survey recent progress in models of risky power plant investments as an equilibrium process, where power generation and sales take place in a stochastic environment; and agents are risk averse & use financial products to offset their risk. Coherent risk measures are powerful in linking risk aversion to standard risk neutral equilibrium models</br>
