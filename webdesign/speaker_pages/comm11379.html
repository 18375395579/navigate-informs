<br>Title: Condition-based Maintenance through Targeted Bayesian Networks</br><br>Author: Aviv Gruber, Researcher, Tel Aviv University, 7 Hanotea St., P.O.B. 171, Hadar-Am, 42935, Israel, avivgrub@post.tau.ac.il</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a failure prediction mechanism, based on a machine-learning application. This mechanism serves as the core of the decision-making step, enabling an efficient use of the existing operational data. This is achieved by accounting for the relations between the operational attributes that are most relevant for failure prediction, through measures from Information Theory. We demonstrate the impact of the proposed approach by presenting an application of freight wagon fleet life-cycle cost-analysis, using Monte Carlo simulation.</br>
