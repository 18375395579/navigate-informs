Title: Robust Non-Convex Multi-Modality Radiation Planning<br>Author: Omid Nohadani, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant St, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, nohadani@purdue.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The radiation therapy of cancerous tumors is optimized based on initial data and independent of other modalities. When Chemotherapy is administered concurrently,  the sensitivity of the tissue to radiation changes over time, reducing the treatment quality. A robust non-convex optimization method is proposed, harnessing this evolution and provides strategies that are intrinsically insensitive to deviations from the assumed temporal path. Clinical cases are used to demonstrate the performance.
