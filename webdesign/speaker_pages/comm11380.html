An assembly process is modeled as a spatial indexed state transition dynamic system. The model takes into account product and process factors such as: part-to-fixture, part-to-part and inter-station interactions, which represent the influences coming from both tooling errors and part errors. The incorporation of the virtual fixture concept and inter-station interaction leads to the generic, unified SOVA model formulation. An automatic model generation technique is also developed for surmounting difficulties in modeling based on first principles. It enhances the applicability in modeling complex assemblies. The model is validated using industrial case studies and series of simulations conducted using standardized industrial software (3DCS Analyst).  	The recent advances of SOVA model in application is also presented, which is composed of (1) multivariate process capability for system robustness evaluation; (2) tolerance design allocation; and (3) diagnosis. Sensitivity and multivariate process capability analysis using Yield Surrogate Model are introduced for system synthesis, which is formulated as a probabilistic optimization problem. Strategies and algorithms are developed for optimization in synthesis. The sensitivity and Orthogonal Diagonalization Analysis are developed for dimensional fault diagnosis. Comprehensive case studies, including either software simulation cases and industrial cases, were conducted for validation purposes.
