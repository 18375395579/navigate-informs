Title: From Value Rhetoric to Valuation<br>Author: Somik Raha, Doctoral Candidate, Stanford University, The Stanford Decisions and Ethics Center, Terman Engineering Center #418, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, somik.raha@gmail.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Value rhetoric is the language decision makers use to justify or explain preferences. The speaker studied the Stanford Police Department and mined their value rhetoric using ethnographic analysis. In the next step, decision diagrams were constructed to identify the attributes of value the police department cared about. This talk focuses on the use of ethnographic methods as a precursor to designing value functions for organizations that care about more than just profit.
