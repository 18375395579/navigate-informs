Title: Linking Momentum Strategies with Single-period Portfolio Models<br>Author: Woo Chang Kim, PhD Candidate, ORFE, Princeton University, E312, E-Quad,, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, wookim@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Mulvey, Mehmet Bilgili<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Several versions of the Markowitz portfolio model are evaluated. The long-only industry-level strategy beats many others and provides a good benchmark for competing optimization models. Simple Markowitz models are quite effective, as long as the proper historical time period is chosen for the stochastic projections. Investment performance of optimal asset allocation models can be improved by considering the momentum effects in the parameter estimation procedures.
