Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to HIV Treatment Allocation in Resource Poor Settings<br>Author: Amin Khademi, PhD Student, University of Pittsburgh, 3700 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, AMK130@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Denis Saure, Andrew Schaefer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: HIV drugs are limited in the developing world. Motivated by this we use validated progression and transmission model of HIV to formulate the problem of allocating scarce treatment doses among a population of infected and susceptible individuals as a Markov Decision Process. In approximating the solution to our model, we used the linear programming approach. The policies derived from this work have been tested by a validated simulation which perform much better than World Health Organization ones.
