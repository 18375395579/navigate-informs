Title: Toward Engineering Design of Factories<br>Author: Leon McGinnis, Georgia Institute ofTechnology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, leon.mcginnis@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edward Huang, Kan Wu, Diego Tamburini<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Engineers who design products routinely use powerful computer based and integrated design and analysis tools.  Engineers who design factories routinely use stand alone tools like Excel, AutoCAD, and simulation, and rarely--if ever--use the results of research on factory design because it isn't an option in the tools they use.  This talk describes how we can change that, and give factory designers access to the same kinds of powerful, integrated tools that product designers use.
