Engineers who design factories routinely use stand alone tools like Excel, AutoCAD, and simulation, and rarely--if ever--use the results of research on factory design because it isn't an option in the tools they use.  This talk describes how we can change that, and give factory designers access to the same kinds of powerful, integrated tools that product designers use.</br>
