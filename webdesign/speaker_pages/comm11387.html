Cluster analysis is employed to identify characteristics of the price curve shape. The proposed price curve model performs well in forecasting both  short-term price such as the day-ahead prices and longer term  price such as the week-ahead prices. The forecast accuracy is  demonstrated by numerical results.</br>
