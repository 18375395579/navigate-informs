Title: Electricity Price Curve Modeling by Manifold Learning<br>Author: Shi-Jie Deng, Assc. Professor, Georgia Inst. of Tech., 755 Ferst Dr., Atlanta, GA, United States, deng@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jie Chen, Xiaoming Huo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a novel non-parametric approach for the  analysis and prediction of electricity price curves by applying  the manifold learning methodology. Cluster analysis is employed to identify characteristics of the price curve shape. The proposed price curve model performs well in forecasting both  short-term price such as the day-ahead prices and longer term  price such as the week-ahead prices. The forecast accuracy is  demonstrated by numerical results.
