<br>Title: Variable Selection in High-dimensional Ordinal Class Prediction Problems with Genomics Applications</br><br>Author: Kellie Archer, Assistant Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, 730 East Broad Street, PO Box 980032, Richmond, VA, 23298-0032, United States of America, kjarcher@vcu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Although classification accuracy is often a goal in predictive modeling, often when conducting high-throughput genomic experiments, it is of interest to identify the genes most predictive of the observed class. Herein, measures of variable importance from bootstrapped classification trees using our proposed ordinal impurity function will be compared to variables identified from L1-penalized GLMs predicting the ordinal response. Results will be presented for both simulated and genomic datasets.</br>
