This information could be employed in aggregate forecasting, inventory decisions, and risk management. We present a model in which total sales is a function of sales forecast, forecast term, and financial market return over the forecast term. We show results using panel data of sales forecast evolution for 214 retailers over 10 years, each year containing many forecasts of varying terms.
