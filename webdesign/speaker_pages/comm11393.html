Title: Analysis of Disease Transmission and Mitigation Strategies in a Point-of-Dispensing<br>Author: Eva K. Lee, Associate Professor & Director, Georgia Institute of Technology, Center for OR in Medicine & HealthCare, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chien-Hung Chen, Joesph Wu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a local outbreak of a highly infectious disease (e.g., smallpox, pneumonic plague, pandemic flu), analyze the potential of disease propagation within a vaccination/drug distribution clinic, and provide insights on how to minimize this risk. We will demonstrate how mathematical modelling can help quantify this risk and assist in the design of an emergency clinic, and show the use of a real-time simulator for mounting an effective monitoring and response against such an event.
