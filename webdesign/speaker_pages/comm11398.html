Title: Designing and Pricing Services Based on Customer-Perceived Value: An Airline Company Feasibility Study<br>Author: Francesco Moresino, Professor, Haute Ecole de Gestion de Genève, HESSO, 7 Route de Drize, Genève, 1227, Switzerland, francesco.moresino@hesge.ch<br>Coauthor(s): Angela Lombardi, Emmanuel Fragnière<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Revenue management models heavily rely on the carrier’s historical booking patterns to forecast passenger demand and to recommend optimal inventory controls.  We are presenting a new integrated model for pricing airline tickets that takes into account the perceived value of multiple services in different competitive environments.  Our integrated model includes a classical aggregate planner for services as well as a share of choice model and can be implemented as a decision support tool.
