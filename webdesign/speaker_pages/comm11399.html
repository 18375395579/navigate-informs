Title: A Column Generation Approach for Heterogeneous Workforce Tour Scheduling<br>Author: Hua Ni, IBM Global Business Services, Fairfax, VA, huani@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Hernan Abeledo<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present an IP model for heterogeneous workforce tour scheduling, which has wide range of applications in public services. Its modeling capabilities include multiskill workforce, productivity, multiple tour types, variable start-times, and multiple breaks. We report on the computational performance of a column generation approach to solve this model efficiently.
