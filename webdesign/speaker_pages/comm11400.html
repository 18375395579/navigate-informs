<br>Title: Second Order Sensitivity in Applied General Equilibrium</br><br>Author: Florian Landis, ZEW Mannheim, L7, 1, Mannheim, 68161, Germany, landis@zew.de</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In applications of general equilibrium modeling, the functional form of cost functions is often chosen based on suitability for numerical solution of the model and calibrated to benchmark data. Assuming weak empirical foundation for this choice, it is a priori unclear to what extent results are driven by it. I present a method for performing second-order sensitivity analysis with respect to functional form, apply it to three general equilibrium models from the literature, and discuss results.</br>
