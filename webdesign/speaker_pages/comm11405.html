Title: Stochastic Traffic Assignment with Price-sensitive Demand: Do Methods Matter?<br>Author: Harry van der Weijde, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, Amsterdam, 1081HV, Netherlands, h.vander.weijde@vu.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Vincent van den Berg, Erik Verhoef<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We compare three classes of stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment models (multinomial probit, nested logit, and generalized nested logit), using a small transport network. After calibrating all models to the same traffic flows, we use them to evaluate several policy decisions, such as second-best pricing, the construction of new links, and capacity expansion. We then investigate how the optimal policies, and their performance, depend on the model choice.
