Current approximate dynamic programming approaches rely on non-smooth, non-monotone transformations of the data, complicating model building and formal model diagnostics.  We propose an approximate dynamic programming algorithm that uses smooth, monotone transformations of the data; the proposed algorithm yields asymptotically normal estimators and facilitates formal model diagnostics.
