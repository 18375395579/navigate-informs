<br>Title: Interactive Q-learning</br><br>Author: Eric Laber, Assistant Professor, North Carolina State University, 102 Glenbrae Ct, Cary, NC, 27518, United States of America, eblaber@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Krisin Linn, Len Stefanski</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: There is interest in estimating optimal treatment policies from sequentially randomized clinical trials.  Current approximate dynamic programming approaches rely on non-smooth, non-monotone transformations of the data, complicating model building and formal model diagnostics.  We propose an approximate dynamic programming algorithm that uses smooth, monotone transformations of the data; the proposed algorithm yields asymptotically normal estimators and facilitates formal model diagnostics.</br>
