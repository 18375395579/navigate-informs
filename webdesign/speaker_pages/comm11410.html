<br>Title: Towards Flexible Decision Support in Multi-unit Sequential B2B Auctions</br><br>Author: Yixin Lu, PhD Candidate, Erasmus University, Rotterdam School of Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, T9-16, Rotterdam, 3062PA, Netherlands, ylu@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eric van Heck, Alok Gupta, Wolf Ketter</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a structural model for multi-unit sequential Dutch auctions in a complex B2B context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explicitly models the sequential aspects of Dutch auctions using structural econometric analysis. Further, we demonstrate how the structural properties can be used to perform policy counterfactuals and develop intelligent software agents that facilitate auctioneer’s real-time decision making.</br>
