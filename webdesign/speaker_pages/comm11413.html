<br>Title: Analysis of Flight Operation Reliability based on the Correction Delay Propagation Tree</br><br>Author: Weiwei Wu, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 29, Yudao Street, Baixia District, Nanjing, China, nhwei@nuaa.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cheng-Lung Wu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We make a probability analysis of airport's flight delay factors based on Bayesian Network to modify the flight delay propagation tree.A set of measuring indices is developed to evaluate schedule reliability and economy.This model can evaluate the influence of airports,airlines and passengers on flight delay.Two flight schedules from an Chinese airline are compared and shows that this modified delay propagation tree is feasible and has practical value.</br>
