Title: Dirichlet Process based Symbolic Analysis for Change Point Detection in Autocorrelated Data<br>Author: Zimo Wang, Research Assistant, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, United States of America, zimo@ostatemail.okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam, Zhenyu (James) Kong<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The Dirichlet process based symbolic dynamic is proposed to detect process changes in autocorrelated data. The transition matrix is constructed for symbol sequence based on Dirichlet process clustering. The change of eigenvector distribution and likelihood value are used to capture the process change. Case study, which uses the ARMA model structure, shows that the proposed methodology is more effective in detecting the process changes than the widely used control charting methods.
