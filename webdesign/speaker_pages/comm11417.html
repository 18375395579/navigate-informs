<br>Title: A Simulation Approach for Rural Patient Scheduling using a Healthcare Information Sharing System</br><br>Author: Andy Banerjee, Associate Professor, Texas A&M University, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 3131 TAMUS, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, banerjee@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hyeongsuk Na</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Access to quality healthcare services is often a challenge for rural patients. It is even more challenging when a patient tries to make appointments with multiple providers. The underlying cause is related to the lack of timely sharing of patient medical information. A patient scheduling problem using a healthcare information sharing system is discussed here. A simulation analysis is used to model and analyze the problem providing insights into the value of shared information.</br>
