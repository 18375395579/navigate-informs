Scenarios are generated using a mixture distribution of asset returns where lower tails and dependence are captured using copula functions while upside returns are modeled via multivariate GARCH. The model is an extended mean-variance approach, with a CVaR constraint. Computational results are presented for portfolios of ETFs of equity indices.</br>
