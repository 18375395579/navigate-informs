Title: Multi-Fidelity Inverse Engineering With Nanotechnology and Other Applications<br>Author: Ravi Rajagopalan, Graduate Teaching Associate, The Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Avenue, 210 Baker Systems, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States, vioravis@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Theodore Allen, Deng Huang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Inverse design is the selection of inputs to match a desired output pattern.  Multi-fidelity kriging optimization offers much promise to do this accurately compared with approaches that calibrate metamodels and then abandon experimental data.  We proposed new methods incorporating discrete inputs and explore a variety of applications.  We compare the proposed approaches with alternatives from the design literature.
