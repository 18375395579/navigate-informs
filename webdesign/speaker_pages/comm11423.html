Title: Investigation of a Hybrid Route Guidance Strategy for Traffic Management under Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications<br>Author: Yong Hoon Kim, Graduate student, Purdue University, 3000 Kent ave., West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, kim523@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study proposes a hybrid route guidance strategy under a centralized traffic control system with fully decentralized Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications (V2V). The proposed model seeks to leverage centralized proactive route guidance and local information available through V2V communications. Numerical experiments are illustrated to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and derive insights using simulated field data.
