Title: A Sequential Airspace Congestion Resolution Method<br>Author: Craig Wanke, Senior Principal Engineer, MITRE, 7515 Colshire Drive, Mailstop N450, McLean, VA, 22101, United States of America, cwanke@mitre.org<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A sequential airspace congestion resolution method is proposed, in which traffic and weather forecast prediction uncertainty is quantified and explicitly used to develop efficient solutions.  The method is based on Monte Carlo simulation of traffic and weather outcomes from a specific forecast.  Candidate sequential decision strategies are evaluated against the range of outcomes to determine the best course of action, trading off among metrics of efficiency, cost, and stability.
