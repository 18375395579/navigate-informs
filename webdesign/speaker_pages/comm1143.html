Title: Interactions between Modeling Systems and Advanced Solvers<br>Author: Michael Bussieck, GAMS Development Corp., 1217 Potomac St NW, Washington, DC, 20007, United States, mbussieck@gams.com<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Dirkse, Alex Meeraus<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Some years ago the classical interface between a modeling system and a MP solver consisted of passing on information about the constraint matrix and function and derivative evaluations for non-linear problems. With emerging new model types and advanced solver technology the need increased for exchanging more structural model information in the name space of the original model. In this paper we will discuss some recent additions to the GAMS system and their communication requirements.
