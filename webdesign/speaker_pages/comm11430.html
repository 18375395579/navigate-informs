Title: DMA-POMDP: A Multi-agent Framework for Decentralized Control and Its Application to Outbreak Response<br>Author: Emine Yaylali, North Carolina State University, 375 Daniels Hall, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, eyaylal@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Julie S. Ivy<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process framework (DMA-POMDP) for decentralized control of multiple agents under uncertainty. DMA-POMDP can be applied to problems where agents have partial information about both other agents and system state and communication between agents is explicitly formulated. We apply the DMA-POMDP framework to a public health setting where local and state health departments seek to optimize the timing of response under a disease outbreak.
