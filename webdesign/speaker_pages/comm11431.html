<br>Title: On-line Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of Functional Imaging Profiles</br><br>Author: Chen Kan, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Ave. ENC 1205, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, chenkan@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Yang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Advancements in metrology have driven the statistical process control from monitoring individual data points to imaging profiles in manufacturing and biological processes. However, nonlinearity and nonstationarity pose significant challenges for process monitoring. This paper presents a two-phase greedy pursuit algorithm for the detection of transient events in imaging profiles. Further, we developed a novel dynamic network approach for online monitoring of functional imaging profiles.</br>
