Title: Sensory-Updated Residual Life Distributions for Components with Exponential Degradation Patterns<br>Author: Nagi Gebraeel, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, 3131 Seamans Center, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, gebraeel@engineering.uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Research on the interpretation of sensory data streams and their utilization in making critical logistical decisions stands to provide significant advancements across various application domains. We develop a stochastic degradation modeling framework for computing and continuously updating component residual life distributions—in support of a sense and respond logistics environment—by combining population specific degradation characteristics with real-time component specific sensory data.
