Title: Inventory as a Driver of Demand<br>Author: Yasin Ceran, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, ceran@utdallas.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In online retailing, inventory decisions can greatly impact sales for a product by affecting, among other things, availability (stock-outs) and word of mouth (WOM). In this study, we develop a model as an extension of similar structural models introduced in the literature. We investigate the impact of inventory on the amount of lost sales. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to test our model with synthetically generated data and then provide an empirical application.
