Title: A Production Function-Based Empirical Analysis of Distribution Networks<br>Author: Donald Warsing, Associate Professor, North Carolina State University, 2346 Nelson Hall, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, don_warsing@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Kay, Christian Rossetti<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Using a number of public data sources, we compare distribution networks in the continental U.S. across several industry sectors. We gather data on, and/or compute from base-level data, a number of independent variables that we use as inputs to a cost function for each DC in each industry data set. This cost function serves as an important means of analyzing the variance in the input data and cost data. We present insights regarding differences in distribution strategies across industries.
