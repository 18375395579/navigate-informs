Such model, in contrast to first-order models, captures higher-order variations inherent in traffic stream. We use the NGSIM dataset to illustrate the unique insight of how the estimation of first- and second-order traffic quantities deteriorates as the sampling frequency and probe penetration rate change.</br>
