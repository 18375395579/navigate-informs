Title: Distributed Resource Allocation in Large Scale Data Intensive Computing<br>Author: Cathy Xia, Professor, Ohio State University, 210 Baker, 1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, xia.52@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Liu, Ness Shroff<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In cloud computing, distributed management of resources for effective data-intensive in-network computing is critical. We consider the optimal resource allocation problem in this context using a network utility optimization framework. We provide second-order based distributed control algorithms with guaranteed quadratic convergence speed.
