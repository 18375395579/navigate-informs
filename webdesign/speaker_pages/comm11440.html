Title: The Economics of Nosocomial Infection Controls in Hospitals<br>Author: Reidar Hagtvedt, hagtvedt@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Griffin, Pinar Keskinocak<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine the economics of strategies to control nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections. Data from one hospital, combined with results from the literature, provide the basis for a simulation of the incidence of nosocomial infections. This model allows costs and benefits of different approaches of infection control to be assessed.
