<br>Title: Dynamic Parameter Selection for Simulation Experiments</br><br>Author: Dashi Singham, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Road, Monterey, United States of America, dsingham@nps.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a method for dynamically changing simulation experimental settings while the model is running to determine run length.  One method is to pre-determine the input parameters as functions of the simulation output, the other is to continually adjust input choices based on the observed output in a feedback control loop.  We explore these ideas in the context of stopping rules for confidence interval procedures.</br>
