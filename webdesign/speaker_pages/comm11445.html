Title: Optimizing the Deployment of Public Access Defibrillators<br>Author: Derya Demirtas, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Rd, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, demirtas@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Roy Kwon, Timothy Chan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Sudden cardiac arrest is a major public health problem. The treatment for cardiac arrest is very time-sensitive. Deploying automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public areas for bystander use reduces the time to defibrillation and improves survival rates. In this talk, we present optimization models to guide the deployment of AEDs in public settings. Computational results using real cardiac arrest and AED data from Toronto, Canada demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.
