Title: Exotic Options Pricing in Levy Process Models with a Hilbert Transform Approach<br>Author: Liming Feng, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 117 Transportation Buliding MC-238, 104 S. Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, feng@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Linetsky<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a new approach to price discretely monitored exotic options in Levy process models. The method involves a sequential evaluation of Hilbert transforms. A discrete approximation with exponentially decaying errors is developed based on Whittaker's cardinal series for functions analytic in a strip.
