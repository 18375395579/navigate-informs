Title: Global and Local Approaches to a Logit-Based Pricing Problem<br>Author: Patrice Marcotte, Professor, University of Montreal, CP 6128, Succ. Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC, H3C3J7, Canada, marcotte@iro.umontreal.Ca<br>Coauthor(s): François Gilbert<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The logit route choice model allows one to model commuter behavior in a network both realistically and in a computationally affordable way. We consider a network toll-setting problem based on a bilevel programming framework where the reaction of the commuters is modelized with a logit model. Observations will be made concerning the general features of the revenue function and a parallel with the deterministic toll setting problem established.
