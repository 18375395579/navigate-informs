<br>Title: Handling Unplanned Absences in Rail Dispatcher Scheduling</br><br>Author: Tony Craig, Postdoctoral Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, E40-211, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, tcraig@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In rail dispatch each absent employee must be covered by a qualified extra board dispatcher or through the use of overtime.  Using data on historical absences, we employ a Poisson regression to identify factors influencing the number of absences. We then analyze the qualifications of current dispatchers and develop a simulation model to predict how changes in the workforce size and qualifications impact the cost of handling unplanned absences.</br>
