<br>Title: Causal Inference for Scale-up in Nano-manufacturing</br><br>Author: Tirthankar Dasgupta, Assistant Professor, Harvard University, Science Center, 1 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138-2901, United States of America, dasgupta@stat.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Qiang Huang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Statistical inference for nanostructure growth models is typically drawn from small scale laboratory-level experiments. To scale up nanostructure growth, it is necessary to expand the scope of inference to super-populations which mimic actual manufacturing conditions. A framework for causal inference, based on potential outcomes, can provide a solution to this challenging problem.</br>
