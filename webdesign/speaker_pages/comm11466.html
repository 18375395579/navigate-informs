<br>Title: The Effects of Demand Subsidies and R&D on Cost Reductions for a Pre-   commercial Low-carbon Energy Technology</br><br>Author: Erin Baker, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 220 ELab, Amherst, MA, United States of America, edbaker@ecs.umass.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The representation of  technological change in large energy-economic model remains highly  stylized relative to the state-of-the-art of understanding about the economics of innovation.  We address this by combining expert elicitations with a bottom-up manufacturing cost model to simulate the cost reductions that result from technology-push and demand-pull technology policies for organic photovoltaics.</br>
