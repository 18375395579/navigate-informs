However, it is difficult to monitor the geometric quality due to the challenges raised from the complexity of the data structure. In this article, we propose an additive Gaussian process (AGP) model to approximate the standard wafer geometric profile while quantifying the normal deviations. Based on the AGP model, two statistical tests are developed to monitor the conformity of the wafers.</br>
