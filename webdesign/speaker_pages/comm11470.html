Fransen, Natasha Hawkins, Irv Susel<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We discuss an approach to aggregating expert judgments when those judgments are given in the form of a distribution function. The method is based on a median filter, is reasonably simple to apply, and has some good properties. For example, both aggregation of probabilities and fractile values are equivalent. The method also has consensus preservation properties. Finally, we examine the impact of the method on calibration and derive an aggregation rule that preserves calibration in certain cases.
