Title: Nonlinearity Analysis of EEG from Patients with Absence Seizure<br>Author: Jicong Zhang, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, jicongzhang@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Art Chaovaitwongse, Panos Pardalos, Basim Uthman, Petros Xanthopoulos, Jicong Zhang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings of absence patient patients suffering were analyzed using the method of approximate entropy (ApEn). The nonlinearity analysis was performed on both before and after medical treatment. The degree of nonlinearity was determined by the differences in ApEn between original and surrogate EEG data sets. The systematic analysis and results from five patient with absence is presented.
