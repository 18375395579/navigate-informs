E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, acalmon@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Graves</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We describe, model and optimize the reverse logistics of our industrial partner, a Fortune 500 company that sells consumer electronics. Based on real data, we introduce a discrete-time model that captures the dynamics of this reverse logistics system. In addition, using an approximate dynamic programming approach, we propose a closed-loop data-driven policy  for managing inventory. The performance of this policy is analysed theoretically and through numerical experiments.</br>
