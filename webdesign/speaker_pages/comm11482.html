Title: Opinion Aggregation in Social Information Systems<br>Author: Srujana Merugu, Yahoo! Research, United States of America, srujana@yahoo-inc.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recent advances in Web 2.0 applications and tools that facilitate generation and publication of content have resulted in huge social information systems, e.g., product review/rating systems (Epinions, Youtube, Yelp), community forums (Y! Answers), social encyclopedias (Wikipedia). The availability of community generated opinions can be of tremendous value as it can enable individual users to leverage the wisdom of crowds. However, aggregating opinions involving heterogeneous topics and sources (i.e., users/automated information extraction agents) is highly  challenging due to a variety of reasons: (1) sources tend to have varying bias and expertise w.r.t. different topics and can often be anonymous, unreliable and even malicious, (2) the observed opinions are often sparse and cannot be assumed to be missing at random, (3) the notion of objective truth is often not meaningful, and is known only for an extremely limited number of cases even when applicable making it difficult to calibrate the system.  In this talk, we describe a principled statistical opinion aggregation methodology (for the special case where there exists an objective truth) that relies on modeling the opinion generation process as a stochastic transformation of the truth. We discuss specific models for both discrete and real-valued opinions that also take into account the observability bias and compare with state-of-art existing techniques.
