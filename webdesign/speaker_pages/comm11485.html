Experience with Bluetooth wireless roadside sensors show that enabled devices are typically detected multiple times as a vehicle moves through the sensor antenna coverage area, which may extend 200 to 300 yards from the roadside sensor. In this research signal strength data from Bluetooth devices is obtained at the same time that the enabled devices are detected. The signal strength data is used to identify when the vehicle is close to passing the sensor. Tests in both controlled and real world environments show the resulting accuracy is sufficient to extend the use of wireless technology to other transportation data collection applications.
