<br>Title: Making High Quality Clinical Decisions: Influence Diagrams for Cost-effectiveness Analysis</br><br>Author: Ram Duriseti, Clinical Assistant Professor, Stanford University, 1890 Oak Knoll Lane, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, United States, ram1@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Medical decisions involve the interplay of many probabilistic variables, and decision alternatives with disparate outcomes, making model design and implementation difficult.  Structural conditions on the ID related to d-separation can determine if a variable's presence or absence will impact the scope and/or the normative results of the model.    We demonstrate the impact of these conditions by constructing two versions of a decision model for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.</br>
