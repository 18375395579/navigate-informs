<br>Title: The Social Cost of Stochastic and Irreversible Climate Change</br><br>Author: Yongyang Cai, Stanford University, 424 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA, United States of America, yycai@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Lontzek, Kenneth Judd</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: There is great uncertainty about how CO2 emissions will affect economic welfare. DSICE is a DSGE extension of DICE. DSICE uses empirically plausible parameters for Epstein-Zin preferences to represent attitudes towards risk, and models uncertainty about future damages. This DSICE case implies carbon taxes much higher than implied by deterministic models, and indicates that optimal policies are much more sensitive to uncertainty than previously thought.</br>
