We develop models for predicting RT starting volumes.  Data from the BCCA patient database were used in regression models to examine patient data and other upstream indicators that may be useful in predicting RT starting volumes.  We found that a basic model using site admits from the prior three months is a good predictor for RT starting volumes.</br>
