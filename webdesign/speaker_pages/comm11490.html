Title: Real-time Demand Response Model<br>Author: Antonio Conejo, Professor, Universidad Castilla - La Mancha, Campus Universitario, Ciudad Real, 13071, Spain, Antonio.Conejo@uclm.es<br>Coauthor(s): Luis Baringo, Juan Miguel Morales<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This presentation describes an optimization model to adjust the hourly load level of a given consumer in response to electricity prices. The objective of the model is to maximize the consumer utility. Price uncertainty is modeled through robust optimization techniques. The model materializes into a simple LP that can be integrated in the Energy Management System of a household or a small business. A simple bi-directional communication device enables the implementation of the proposed model.
