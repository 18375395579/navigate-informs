The objective of the model is to maximize the consumer utility. Price uncertainty is modeled through robust optimization techniques. The model materializes into a simple LP that can be integrated in the Energy Management System of a household or a small business. A simple bi-directional communication device enables the implementation of the proposed model.</br>
