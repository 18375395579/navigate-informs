Model parameters are estimated by adjusting expert responses using a sufficient number of questions with known answers.  We apply these models to datasets of expert elicitations, testing model validity with holdout analysis and quantile-quantile plots.  The bi-normal model fits better, indicating an asymmetric overprecision bias.</br>
