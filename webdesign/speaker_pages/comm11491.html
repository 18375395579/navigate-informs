Kenney<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Elicited confidence intervals tend to be overly narrow.  We propose a model to correct this bias based on the normal and bi-normal distributions. Model parameters are estimated by adjusting expert responses using a sufficient number of questions with known answers.  We apply these models to datasets of expert elicitations, testing model validity with holdout analysis and quantile-quantile plots.  The bi-normal model fits better, indicating an asymmetric overprecision bias.
