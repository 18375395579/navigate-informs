Title: Pricing and Hedging of Volatility Derivatives<br>Author: Ashish Jain, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway Uris Hall, New York, NY, 10027, United States, aj2109@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Broadie<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a methodology to price and hedge volatility derivatives. We derive a no arbitrage relationship between variance swaps and other volatility derivatives. Using this argument, we derive a partial differential equation to price volatility swaps and variance options in the Heston stochastic volatility model and compute the volatility and variance strikes using numerical transform inversion techniques and simulation.
