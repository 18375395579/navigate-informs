Title: On the Value of Better Models for the Electricity Sector<br>Author: Alberto Lamadrid, Graduate Student, Cornell University, 419 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, ajl259@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Mount, Ray Zimmerman, Robert Thomas, Carlos Murillo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper measures the value of the stochastic solution for a system with penetration of renewable energy sources, by comparing it to a deterministic formulation with fixed locational reserves. Our model of the electricity network has a system planner seeking to minimize the cost of providing both energy and ancillary services using a security constrained Optimal Power Flow and explicitly reproducing the uncertainty in the system by using a Markovian transition probability matrix.
