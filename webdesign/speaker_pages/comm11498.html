<br>Title: Resilient Patient Scheduling in Complex Outpatient Clinics</br><br>Author: Elham Torabi, PhD Student, University of Cincinnati, 2925 Campus Green Dr., OBAIS Department, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, United States of America, torabiem@mail.uc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Craig Froehle, Uday Rao</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Complex clinics involve multiple care providers, so coping with operational disruptions can be challenging. We develop stochastic optimization models for patient scheduling with uncertain clinical task durations, minimizing clinic duration and patient waits. We consider several different assumptions about task durations and test each model’s resilience to disruption via discrete-event simulation.</br>
