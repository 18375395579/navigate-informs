Title: Risk-averse Stochastic Unit Commitment with Incomplete Information<br>Author: Ruiwei Jiang, University of Florida, 411 Weil Hall, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, rwjiang@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yongpei Guan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we propose a risk-averse stochastic unit commitment model to hedge against incomplete information upon the volatile renewable energy. Our proposed model is based on real data samples collected in practice, and can ensure renewable energy utilization with a high probability. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence property of the risk-averseness of the model as the sample size grows.
