Pintér, President  and Research Scientist, Pinter Consulting Services Inc., 129 Glenforest Drive, Halifax, NS, B3M 1J2, Canada, jdpinter@hfx.eastlink.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Frank Kampas</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We discuss non-overlapping packings of uniform and non-uniform size spheres into containers. The generic objective is to provide tightest possible packings: this leads to context-dependent model forms. We present model variants and illustrative numerical results, using MathOptimizer Professional (MOP). MOP is our Mathematica package with an easy-to-use interface to the LGO global/local optimization solver suite.</br>
