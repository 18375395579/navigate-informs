<br>Title: Most Informative Component Analysis in Application to a Stock Market</br><br>Author: Anton Molyboha, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Math department, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States of America, amolyboh@stevens.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A novel model of a stock market has been developed, which provides a global view at investors preferences. A maximum entropy technique for fitting the model to the data has been elaborated. In the framework of the model, the Most Informative Component Analysis (MICA) has been applied to characterize the state of the market. The MICA is based on the notion of mutual information and identifies the most informative factors for describing stochastic system states and comparing states one to another.</br>
