Title: An Efficient Variable Selection Approach for Analyzing Designed Experiments<br>Author: Ming Yuan, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Dr. NW, Atlanta, GA, United States, myuan@isye.gatech.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The analysis of experiments where a large number of potential variables are examined is driven by the principles of effect sparsity, effect hierarchy, and effect heredity. We propose an efficient variable selection strategy to specifically address the unique challenges faced by such analysis. The proposed methods are very fast to compute and can find sparse models that better satisfy the goals of experiments.
