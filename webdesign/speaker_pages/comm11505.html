Title: Securities Trading of Concepts: Is It Marketing or Finance?<br>Author: Hyun Shin, Assistant Professor of Marketing, Long Island University CW Post, School of Business, Brookville, NY, 11548, United States of America, hyun.shin@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ely Dahan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Securities Trading of Concepts (STOC) markets combine elements of market research and finance in order to measure the consensus on the value of new product concepts. Via statistical analyses we show that, due to the lack of new information arrival, STOC prices follow a stationary process unlike real financial securities. We predict the direction of price movements from one trade to the next by using an autoregressive model, and demonstrate external validity of the method in multiple ways.
