<br>Title: Nurse Absenteeism and Staffing Strategies for Hospital Inpatient Units</br><br>Author: Wen-Ya Wang, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street S.E., Minneapolis, United States of America, wenya@ie.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diwakar Gupta</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop models for determining the number of nurses to assign to inpatient units when nurse absentee rates are heterogeneous.  The assumption of heterogeneous absentee rates is supported by a detailed analysis of data from multiple nursing units of two hospitals. We establish structural properties of an optimal nurse assignment strategy and propose heuristics that perform well in numerical experiments.</br>
