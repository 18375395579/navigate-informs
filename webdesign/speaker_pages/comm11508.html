Title: Operations Based Data and Earnings Prediction<br>Author: Taylor Randall, University of Utah, Campus Center Drive, Salt Lake City, UT, United States of America, taylor.randall@business.utah.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jim Cannon, Christian Terwiesch<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper examines the importance and relevance of using operations based variables to predict future accounting earnings. We use the U.S. airline industry to show and identify what type of operational variables provide incremental predictive information beyond that which is found in earnings and accountings information.  Further, we show that stock market analysts do not fully incorporate the predictive information found in certain operational variables into earnings estimates.
