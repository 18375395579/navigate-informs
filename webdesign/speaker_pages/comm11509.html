<br>Title: An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to Developing Strategies for a Multi-species Stand</br><br>Author: Jules Comeau, Dalhousie University, 37 Braemar Dr., Moncton, NB, E1A3S7, Canada, jcomeau5@dal.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eldon Gunn</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In forest stand optimization, most whole stand models use multi-dimensional state descriptors. The discretization of this state space becomes a major issue when using dynamic programming (DP) in developing optimal harvest policies. This paper introduces the application of a modern dynamic programming approach in developing multi-species, even-aged decision policies in a stochastic environment.</br>
