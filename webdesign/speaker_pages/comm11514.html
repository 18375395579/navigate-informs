The system circumvents the constraints in real-time operations, and develops some effective models for data filtering, mainline volume prediction, ramp volume estimation and online simulation. The field study conducted in the Maryland Eastern Shore region (between Ocean City and Bay Bridge) has indicated the potential of the system for online travel time prediction.</br>
