Title: Why Wikipedia Works: Modeling the Stability of Collective Information Update Processes<br>Author: Sanmay Das, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Department of Computer Science, 110 8th St, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, sanmay@cs.rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Malik Magdon-Ismail<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: How do Wikipedia pages become stable and trusted information sources?  We analyze highly edited Wikipedia pages and show that they almost  inevitably converge to a stable state instead of continuing to accrue  edits (the expected behavior under traditional growth models).  We  present a stochastic model of information growth for Wikipedia pages  and show that this model provides an excellent fit to the actual  accumulation of edits on highly-edited Wikipedia pages.
