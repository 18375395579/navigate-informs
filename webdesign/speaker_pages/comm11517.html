Title: A Discrete-Time Simulation Model for the Airport Capacity/Delay Analysis<br>Author: Hojong Baik, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 301 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24060, United States, hbaik@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Antonio Trani<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We introduce a new simulation model, named VTASIM, developed for the analysis of airfield operations. Unique features of VTASIM are: 1) It is a discrete-time simulation model; 2) It can capture the communication activities between pilots and controllers; 3) To find efficient taxiing paths between gates and runway exits, the time-dependent shortest path algorithm is implemented, and 4) For runway operations, two types of aircraft sequencing (i.e., FCFS and optimized) methods are applied.
