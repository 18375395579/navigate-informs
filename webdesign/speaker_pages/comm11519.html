Behavioral reactions of route and departure time choices are considered through a positive agent-based demand model, while a Dynamic Traffic Assignment model is adopted to evaluate network dynamics. The integrated model is applied on the Inter-County Corridor in the metropolitan Washington D.C. area.</br>
