Title: Assessing Dynamic Pricing Strategies using Integrated Demand and Network Models<br>Author: Shanjiang Zhu, Assistant Research Scientist, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn L. Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, zhuxx120@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ryan Jian, Chenfeng Xiong, Mostafa Mollanejad, Lei Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This research develops an integrated demand and network modeling framework to assess dynamic pricing strategies. Behavioral reactions of route and departure time choices are considered through a positive agent-based demand model, while a Dynamic Traffic Assignment model is adopted to evaluate network dynamics. The integrated model is applied on the Inter-County Corridor in the metropolitan Washington D.C. area.
