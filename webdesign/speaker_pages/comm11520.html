We develop a framework to quantify the value of free or low cost online applications using the insight that even when people do not pay cash, they must still pay “attention,?or time, when consuming information services. We contrast the value of consumer surplus using two different methods, one based on the value of market expenditure, and one based on the value of time spent consuming free goods.</br>
