Our approach combines staffing and rostering into one step, while eliminating scheduling altogether.  This enables a more global optimization of the tactical planning problem.  Our approach however is about more than simply combining process steps.  It also leverages the inherent flexibility of the virtual call center model.  A simulation study reveals the financial benefit of our approach.</br>
