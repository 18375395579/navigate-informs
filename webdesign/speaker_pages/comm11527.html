We analyze vulnerability of SDs by modeling the assignment of protection levels to them, and thereby, decreasing their chance of being affected by the disaster.  We also consider vulnerability of route segments involved in supply distribution between SDs and demand points using some ideas from the Influence Maximization literature. Numerical examples will be presented to contrast with existing models.</br>
