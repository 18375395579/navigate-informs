Title: Real-Time Orienteering Problem with Stochastic Travel Times<br>Author: Irina Dolinskaya, Assistant Professor, Northwestern University, Technological Institute M235, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, dolira@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karen Smilowitz, Zhenyu (Edwin) Shi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study an extension of the orienteering problem (OP) with stochastic travel times where network information is updated in real-time.  Furthermore, the decisions regarding customer sequence and path choice affect the information gathered, requiring exploration vs. exploitation analysis. We present adaptive path planning methods to take advantage of this data, combining OP and optimal path finding. Application to search-and-rescue operations in a disaster affected region is also presented.
