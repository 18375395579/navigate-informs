Furthermore, the decisions regarding customer sequence and path choice affect the information gathered, requiring exploration vs. exploitation analysis. We present adaptive path planning methods to take advantage of this data, combining OP and optimal path finding. Application to search-and-rescue operations in a disaster affected region is also presented.</br>
