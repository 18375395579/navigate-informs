Title: Multivariate Statistical Process Control with Artificial Contrasts<br>Author: George Runger, Professor, Arizona State University, runger@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eugene Tuv, Wookyeon Hwang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A multivariate control region is a pattern that represents the normal operating conditions of a process. Reference data is generated and used to learn the difference between this region and random noise. Multivariate SPC is transformed to supervised learning. Such a computational approach is easily accomplished with modern computing resources.
