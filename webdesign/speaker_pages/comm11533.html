Title: Automated Learning of Algebraic Models for Optimization<br>Author: Alison Cozad, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, United States of America, acozad@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nick Sahinidis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: What often hinders the application of algebraic models and advanced optimization algorithms is the lack of algebraic formulations. Practitioners often find it easier to develop simulation models. To expand the range of application of algebraic modeling systems and optimization algorithms, we have developed ALAMO (Automated Learning of Algebraic Models for Optimization). This tool iteratively generates surrogate models from simulations or experiments that are tailored for algebraic optimization.
