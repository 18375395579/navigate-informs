Title: A Geospatial Location Problem to Minimize Customer Abandonments<br>Author: Fang Lu, University of Texas at Austin, 204 E. Dean Keeton St. Stop C2200, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, lufang05@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): John Hasenbein, David Morton<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Inspired by a practical geographical detection problem, we examine the problem  of locating M/G/k+M type stations on a network in order to minimize abandonments.  We develop heuristic algorithms based on M/G/k+M queueing  approximations and use detailed simulation models to evaluate and enhance our   suggested policies.
