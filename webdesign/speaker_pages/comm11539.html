Raghavan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In many application domains, a mobile service facility provides service to events while stationary. For example, portable base stations are used in cellular networks to provide coverage for emergencies and special events. Also, mobile clinics are used to provide services in developing countries.  We discuss routing a single mobile facility to maximize demand coverage over a continuous time planning horizon. We demonstrate how dynamic program can be used to quickly find an optimal schedule.</br>
