<br>Title: Inferring Individual Activity Patterns using Large-scale Geo-location Data</br><br>Author: Samiul Hasan, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, samiul@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The recent introduction of the location-based services in various smartphone applications has enabled people to share their activity related choices at the level of specific geo-referenced location and time. Multi-day patterns of individual activity behaviors can be inferred from this large-scale geo-location information. In this work we first develop a model for inferring the semantic labels of activity locations. This model helps to identify an individual's home and workplace from the check-in patterns. We then develop a hierarchical Bayes model for predicting patterns in individual activity choice behaviors</br>
