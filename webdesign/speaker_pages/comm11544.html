If such interval forecasts are obtained from two or more assessors, combining them into a single interval estimate is a challenging task.  We explore various heuristics for combining these interval estimates, using data from analysts predicting future financial quantities.  The heuristics are evaluated by scoring rules that trade off sharpness against calibration.</br>
