Title: Model-based Clustering of Taxonomy Trees and its Application to Analysis of Human Microbiome Data<br>Author: Patricio LaRosa, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, St. Louis, IL, United States of America, PLAROSA@dom.wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Shannon, Erica Sodergren, Yanjiao Zhou, Elena Deych, Berkley Shands, George Weinstock<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Human microbiome research uses DNA sequencing technology to characterize bacteria living in and on us and how they impact our health. The data generated is represented as a taxonomy tree of bacteria. There is one such tree for each sample analyzed. In this talk, we will present a model for bacterial taxonomy trees and a clustering method of trees using a finite mixture model based on this model. Application of this method to the analysis of bacterial taxonomy trees from HMP will be presented.
