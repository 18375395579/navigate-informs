Title: Remaining Useful Life Prediction for Automotive Batteries<br>Author: Qiang Zhou, Assistant Professor, City University of Hong Kong, Dept. of Systems Eng & Eng Mgnt, Kownloon, Hong Kong - PRC, q.zhou@cityu.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Junbo Son, Shiyu Zhou, Xiaofeng Mao, Mutasim Salman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Many failures in engineering can be traced back to some underlying degradation processes. We propose a two-stage prognostic framework for individual units subject to hard failure, based on joint modeling of degradation signal and time-to-event data.Its application in automotive battery residual life prediction has been discussed in this paper as an example.
