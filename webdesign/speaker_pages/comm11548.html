Rodrigues, Research Assistant, IIT - Instituto de Investigación Tecnológica - Madrid - Spain, calle Santa cruz de marcenado, 26, Madrid, 28015, Spain, renato.rodrigues@iit.upcomillas.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pedro Linares</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The importance of energy and environmental policy assessments requires a detailed consideration of which modeling instrument is better suited for the task. This work presents the results obtained from a traditional CGE, a time and technological disaggregated CGE, a bottom-up electricity and a hybrid modeling alternative face to face in order to underline the strengths and caveats of each of the most common modeling framework alternatives in the energy-environmental policy evaluations.</br>
