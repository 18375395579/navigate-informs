Title: A Comparison of the Original and Revised Basel Market Risk Frameworks for Regulating Bank Capital<br>Author: Alexandre Baptista, George Washington University, 2201 G Street Northwest, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, alexbapt@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gordon Alexander, Shu Yan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Risk management systems based on the original and revised Basel market risk frameworks allow the selection of trading portfolios with substantive tail risk. However, a system based on the revised framework tends to be less effective in controlling tail risk. Importantly, the minimum capital requirements in the revised framework are much less likely to be wiped out by trading losses than those in the original framework. Thus, on balance, the revised framework improves upon the original framework.
