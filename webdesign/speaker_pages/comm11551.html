Title: Using Tags for Collaborative Filtering<br>Author: Iljoo Kim, University of Utah, pactik@business.utah.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gautam Pant, Olivia Sheng<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: While tagging has been widely deployed to support search and categorization applications, studies that investigate the use of tags for improving the performance of recommender systems are limited. We propose a modified collaborative-filtering recommendation system that uses tag-based profiling and present an empirical evaluation of the proposed system.
