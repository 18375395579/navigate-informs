Title: Innovative Services in City Logistics<br>Author: Luce Brotcorne, INRIA, 40 Avenue Halley - Bat A, Parc Scientifique de la Haute Borne, Villeneuve D'Ascq, 59650, France, luce.brotcorne@inria.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Alexandre Huart, Frederic Semet<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Most providers in city logistics have transportation and storage capacities exceeding what is effectively used. To better meet the offer, an innovative strategy for an alliance of logistic providers is to develop a collaborative approach based on the pooling of residual capacities resulting of their activities. We propose a model for routing demands over a network defined by logistic services and show how innovative services can be modeled. Numerical results are presented.
