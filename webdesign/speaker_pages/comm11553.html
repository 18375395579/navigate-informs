Epidemiologists have warned that one in every three people could be infected, many of them requiring hospitalization. We constructed a model to predict the number of people infected, using data for state of Georgia.  We developed optimization models to design networks to distribute food to affected populations, and analyzed the number and location of facilities to be set up.</br>
