Title: Agent-based Simulation in Extreme Event Evacuation: Examining Social Communication<br>Author: Nannan Chen, Texas A&M University, 3006 ETB TAMU, College Station, TX, 77840, United States of America, nnchen@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Justin Yates<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop an agent-based simulation model to capture travel patterns for extreme event evacuation problems. We consider different travel behavior groups on real-world road networks and connect individual agents via social network. Traffic information is updated in real time and can be shared among agents through their social connections.
