<br>Title: Modeling Aviation Passenger Security Processes: A Judgment and Dynamic Decision-Making Approach</br><br>Author: Ignacio J. Martinez-Moyano, Computational Scientist, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 South Cass Avenue, Building 900, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States, imartinez@anl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Cox, Chris Krahe, Stephen Conrad</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A model of airport passenger security checkpoint operations using system dynamics and social judgment theory is presented. We model screening operations as a detection-selection problem of judgment embedded in a dynamic decision-making environment with multiple competing goals and strong socio-technical interactions. The model aims to capture a feedback-rich representation of the security checkpoint process in order to identify leverage points, leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness.</br>
