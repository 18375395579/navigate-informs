Title: Advanced Modeling Techniques in Python<br>Author: William E. Hart, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States of America, wehart@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Paul Watson, Carl Laird, John D. Siirola, David L. Woodruff<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Recently, a variety of algebraic modeling tools have been created within high-level programming languages, including C++, Java, Python and Ruby.  We have previously argued that this allows modelers to leverage sophisticated language constructs and standard libraries, and that this enables a more expressive modeling environment.  But is this claim true?  This presentation critiques examples of modeling with the Pyomo software, which is built in Python.
