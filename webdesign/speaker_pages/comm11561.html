Woodruff</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recently, a variety of algebraic modeling tools have been created within high-level programming languages, including C++, Java, Python and Ruby.  We have previously argued that this allows modelers to leverage sophisticated language constructs and standard libraries, and that this enables a more expressive modeling environment.  But is this claim true?  This presentation critiques examples of modeling with the Pyomo software, which is built in Python.</br>
