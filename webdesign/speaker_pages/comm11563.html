In this paper, the results of an establishment survey are used to identify important criteria in evaluating and selecting a supplier from decision-making point of view. An optimization model is also developed for supplier selection for different industry sectors. The proposed model will be eventually implemented in an activity-based freight demand modeling framework for Chicago.</br>
