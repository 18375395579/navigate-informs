Title: Simulation of Forest Biomass to Bio-fuel and Bioenergy Supply Chains<br>Author: Mahdi Mobini, PhD Candidate, The University of British Columbia, #2943 - 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z4, Canada, mahdi.mobini@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Taraneh Sowlati<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Stochastic discrete-event simulation models are developed to analyze the performance of the supply chain of forest-based biomass to wood pellets (solid biofuel) and combined heat and power. The models take into account the uncertainties in the quality of raw materials and interdependencies between different stages of the supply chain.
