<br>Title: Pricing Managed Lanes Using Simulation</br><br>Author: Robert Phillips, Nomis Solutions, San Bruno, CA, United States of America, robert.phillips@nomissolutions.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Caner Gocmen, Garrett van Ryzin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Managing toll lanes for profit is becoming increasingly common.  We consider the problem of finding revenue-maximizing tolls for a managed lane operator -- that is an operator who can charge a toll for some lanes on a highway while the others remain free to use.  We present some structural results on optimal tolls and use a simulation to evaluate the performance of different tolling schemes such as myopic, static, and dynamic tolling.</br>
