Title: Estimating Cycle Time Quantiles Using Quantile-Regression Based Metamodels<br>Author: Demet Batur, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, CBA 209, Lincoln, NE, 68516, United States of America, dbatur@unl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Bekki<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Simulation models of semiconductor manufacturing facilities are quite complex and can take a prohibitively long amount of time to run. Being able to predict delivery times for future configurations of the manufacturing system is critical and requires the ability to estimate the cycle time distribution. We present a quantile-regression based metamodeling approach and demonstrate its applicability to predicting cycle time quantiles of a simplified semiconductor manufacturing system.
