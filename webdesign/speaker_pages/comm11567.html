Being able to predict delivery times for future configurations of the manufacturing system is critical and requires the ability to estimate the cycle time distribution. We present a quantile-regression based metamodeling approach and demonstrate its applicability to predicting cycle time quantiles of a simplified semiconductor manufacturing system.</br>
