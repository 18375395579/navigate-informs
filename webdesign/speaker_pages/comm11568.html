We propose an analytical and a simulation model based on real options theory to value such a sell option ex-ante and enhance traditional make-or-buy approaches to a make-and-sell-or-buy approach for web services. Thereby, we reveal that this option may have considerable impact on traditional make-or-buy-decisions.</br>
