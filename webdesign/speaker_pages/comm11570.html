Title: Dynamic Dual-toll Pricing with Delayed Departure Times in Hazmat Transportation<br>Author: Tolou Esfandeh, Research Assistant, SUNY-University at Buffalo, 339A Bell Hall, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Buffalo, NY, 14051, United States of America, tolouesf@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Changhyun Kwon, Rajan Batta<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we develop and analyze a time dependent dual toll-pricing model to mitigate the risk of hazmat transportation.Our risk measure applies time-varying link traffic flow to indicate the accident consequences. The model permits trip makers to respond differently either by choosing the least cost path or by delaying the departure time . We formulate the model as a dynamic mathematical problem and propose a solution method.
