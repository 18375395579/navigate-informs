Title: The Erlang A Model, Square-root Staffing and Refined Heavy-traffic Results<br>Author: Johan Leeuwaarden, Technical University of Eindhoven, Netherlands, j.s.h.v.leeuwaarden@TUE.nl<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present new Gaussian approximations for the incomplete gamma function. In earlier work, these bounds were used to obtain refined heavy-traffic results for the Erlang B and C models in the Halfin-Whitt regime (square-root staffing). We now discuss how refinements can be obtained for the Erlang A model (the M/M/s queue with abandonment/reneging). Joint work with A.J.E.M. Janssen and B. Zwart.
