Title: Stochastic Modeling of Wind Generation for Long-term Planning and Regulatory Studies<br>Author: William Rosehart, Professor, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive, N.W., Calgary, AB, T2N1N4, Canada, rosehart@ucalgary.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Hamid Zareipour, David Westwick, John MacCormack<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This work describes a method to create realistic time series models of wind generation for use in planning studies.  Seasonal and diurnal regularities are filtered from the data and a stochastic model of the residual shape information is created that preserves key statistical properties of the observed data. The model can be used to create scenarios of future wind developments that reasonably capture both the deterministic and random characteristics of wind generation that are locally unique.
