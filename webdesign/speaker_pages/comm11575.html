Title: The Computational Properties of Model 4 Harvest Scheduling Models<br>Author: Rachel St.John, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States of America, rkrieg@washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sandor Toth<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Model 4 is a new spatially explicit harvest scheduling model that uses adaptive volume coefficients, driven by a set of difference equations and Boolean algebra, to transition the states of forest stands from one planning period to the next. We provide a mathematical description of Model 4, show how maximum harvest opening size constraints can be incorporated in the new model and present some computational results
