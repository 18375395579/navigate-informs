<br>Title: Sensor Fault Detection in Presence of Model Specified Manufacturing Process Faults</br><br>Author: Shan Li, University of Iowa, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, shanli@engineering.uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yong Chen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes a W control chart to detect the sensor mean shift faults in discrete manufacturing processes based on a linear fault-quality model. The sensitivity of the W chart to the occurrence of sensor faults is studied.  A parameter called sensitivity preserving ratio (SPR) is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the control chart. In comparison with the control chart directly monitoring the product quality characteristics, our W chart can separate sensor faults from the process faults.</br>
