Efficient estimation techniques are required to understand temporal dynamics and develop effective control strategies. In this work, we use nonlinear interior-point methods to estimate seasonal parameters in infectious disease models using measles case count data. Our results show seasonal patterns that are strongly correlated with school term holidays across very different social settings and holiday schedules.</br>
