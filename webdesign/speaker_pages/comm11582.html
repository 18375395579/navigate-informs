<br>Title: The Exponomial Choice Model</br><br>Author: Aydin Alptekinoglu, Associate Professor of Supply Chain Management, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States of America, aydin@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Semple</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new discrete choice model and explore its implications for pricing and assortment planning. Greatly facilitated by the fact that the loglikelihood function is concave in the unknown parameters, we estimate our model and compare it with multinomial logit on real choice data.</br>
