<br>Title: Clustered Graph Randomization: Network Exposure to Multiple Universes</br><br>Author: Johan Ugander, Cornell University, Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, jhu5@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brian Karrer, Lars Backstrom, Jon Kleinberg</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A/B testing is a standard approach for evaluating the effect of online experiments, but it is poorly suited for experiments involving social interference, when the treatment of individuals spills over to neighbors in a social network. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for using graph clustering to analyze experimental treatment effects under social interference, including graph-theoretic conditions under which individuals can be considered to be 'network exposed' to an experiment.</br>
