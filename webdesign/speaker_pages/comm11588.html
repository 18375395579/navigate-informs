Title: Monitoring Wafer Geometric Quality using Additive Gaussian Process Model<br>Author: Linmiao Zhang, National University of Singapore, 1 Engineering Drive 2, Singapore, Singapore, a0089309@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Nan Chen, Kaibo Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Monitoring wafer geometric quality in semiconductor manufacturing is difficult due to complex data structures. In this article, we propose an additive Gaussian process (AGP) model to approximate standard geometric quality profile and to quantify the profile deviations when the process is in control. Based on the AGP model, we further develop two statistical tests to monitor the wafer geometric quality.
