These smaller units are designed to be agile, expeditionary, tailored to specific circumstances (e.g., nature of threat, climate, terrain, etc.), and capable of rapid assembly. This study, completed in July 2007, based on a discrete event simulation model of the unit reset process and installation resource  constratins, identified adjustments to resources and/or procedures that appear to be necessary for units to  meet ARFORGEN guidelines.</br>
