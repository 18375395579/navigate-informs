<br>Title: Time Series Forecasting for Nonlinear and Nonstationary Systems: A Comparative Study</br><br>Author: Changqing Cheng, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74074, United States of America, changqing.cheng@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Trung Le, Satish Bukkapatnam, Hui Yang, Zhenyu (James) Kong</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Complex systems usually demonstrate nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics. Time series data from those systems can represent casual and dynamic information about the underlying dynamics, and provide a unique way to monitor the system state evolution. We reviewed the recently developed models for nonlinear nonstationary time series prediction, and provided a comparative study.</br>
