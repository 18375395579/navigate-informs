Title: Evaluating Pediatric Access to Proton Therapy Using Discrete Event Simulation<br>Author: Lauren Cipriano, Research Scientist, Institute for Technology Assessment, 101 Merrimac Street, 10th Floor, Boston, MA, 02114, United States, Lauren@mgh-ita.org<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Nguyen, James Stahl<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Proton beam radiation has proven a useful therapy for treating rare diseases such as sarcomas, eye tumors, and select head and neck and pediatric cancers.  There is growing evidence that it may also be useful for treating more common cancers such as those of the prostate.  We consider the potential demand from pediatric cancer patients in New England. We present a discrete event simulation for evaluating access to this limited medical resource.
