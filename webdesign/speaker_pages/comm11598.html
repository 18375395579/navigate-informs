Title: Location, Location, Location! Asset Pricing Models with Spatial Interaction<br>Author: Haowen Zhong, PhD Student, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, United States of America, hz2193@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Kou, Xianhua Peng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Spatial interaction is important in modeling real estate assets. In this paper, we propose SCAPM and SAPT that extend the classical asset pricing models by incorporating spatial interaction among asset returns. Our models characterize the risk premiums of both ordinary assets and futures contracts in an economy with spatial interaction and show the influence of spatial interaction on risk premiums. Statistical inference procedures for the models are also derived and an empirical test is given.
