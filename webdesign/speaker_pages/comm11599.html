Realistic behavioral models of individual location choices for these secondary activities have great importance in activity-based travel demand analysis. However, large-scale empirical observations for secondary activity location choices are not very common. In this work we develop a location choice model for discretionary activities using a large collection of check-in information shared in online social media.
