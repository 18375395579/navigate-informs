Title: Modeling the Application of Prognostics and Health Management in Large-scale Logistic Simulations<br>Author: Kimberly Welch, Sandia National Labs, P.O. Box 5800 MS 1011, Albuquerque, 87185, United States of America, kmwelch@sandia.gov<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Prognostics is a growing concept in system design and is a requirement for military systems, such as the JSF F-35 Fighter Jet and the Future Combat Systems.  Algorithms have been developed by SNL in order to model the effects of prognostics in large-scale reliability and logistics simulations.  These prediction algorithms allow for an intelligent response to preventative maintenance concepts.  Two different modeling approaches were developed and will be discussed along with results.
