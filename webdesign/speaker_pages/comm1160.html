<br>Title: Quantitative Complexity Analysis in Multi-Channel Intracranial EEG Recordings from Epileptic Brains</br><br>Author: Chang-Chia Liu, Research Assistant, University of Florida, Dep. of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Dep. of Biomedical Engineering, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, iamjeff@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Deng-Shan Shiau, J. Chris Sackellares, W. Art Chaovalitwongse, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical methods have been successfully used in EEG analysis. We show that the degree of complexity reflected by the value of the minimum embedding dimension converged to lower value during the Ictal state was observed in epileptic regions as well as non-epileptic regions. We suggest that the nonlinear dynamical analysis can provide a useful mechanism for detecting relative changes in brain dynamics, which cannot be detected by conventional linear analysis.</br>
