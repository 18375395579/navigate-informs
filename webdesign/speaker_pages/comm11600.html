A novel aspect of this project is the inclusion of weather variables in the data set. The data mining techniques include Support Vector Machines (SVM) using the Gaussian kernel and Random Forests (RF).  The data mining techniques are compared to negative binomial regression.  The predictive performance of all models is assessed via 10-fold cross-validation.</br>
