Title: Economic Analysis of the Registered Traveler Program<br>Author: Alan Scheller-Wolf, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, awolf@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vineet Kumar, Ramayya Krishnan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The registered traveler program allows participants to use special, faster lines for security checks if they submit additional information to the government. We use a game-theoretic framework to model such travelers who value shorter wait times, but face a loss of utility if they reveal private information. We find conditions under which having a registered traveler program is socially suboptimal, and characterize the optimal level of information revelation when such a program is desirable.
