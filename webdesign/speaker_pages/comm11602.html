Title: Analytical Support to Marine Aviation Logistics<br>Author: Tom Tsoutis, USMC, 3300 Russell Road, Quantico, VA, anastasios.tsoutis@usmc.mil<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Marine Aviation Logistics Support Program (MALSP) II is the next generation of logistics support concept with the aim of producing improved performance while reducing the deployment footprint.  We use modeling to analyze different configurations in order to determine the best way to set up aviation logistics support.  The scope of our analysis includes developing a method to use historical data and expected operational utilization to predict demand profiles.
