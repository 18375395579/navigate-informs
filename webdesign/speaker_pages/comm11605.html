Their study has yielded inequalities that are useful in computation. We consider a multicommodity extension of variable upper bound flow models. We perform a polyhedral study of this extended model, investigating novel aspects of its structure while also examining its relationship to the single-commodity case. In particular, we identify a large family of inequalities that generalizes well-known flow cover inequalities.</br>
