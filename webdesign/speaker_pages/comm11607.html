<br>Title: Generation Investment Equilibria with Strategic Producers in an Electricity Pool: An EPEC Approach</br><br>Author: S. Jalal Kazempour, PhD student, Univ. of Castilla - La Mancha, E.T.S.

The investment problem of each producer is modeled through a bilevel model, which is transformed into an MPEC using a primal-dual transformation. The joint consideration of all producer MPECs constitutes an EPEC. To identify its solutions, each MPEC is replaced by its KKT conditions, which are in turn linearized. The equilibria represented by such conditions are explored using an auxiliary MILP.</br>
