A generalized DEA model is developed to analyze firms' financial statements over time to determine a relative financial strength indicator that is highly correlated with stock returns. The model uses expert information in input/output selection. The correlation maximization binary model is solved via a two-step heuristic algorithm. Computational evidence is presented with over 800 public firms from 9 US sectors.
