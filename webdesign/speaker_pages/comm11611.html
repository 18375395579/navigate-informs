Serdar Simsek, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, ASimsek13@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin, Robert Phillips<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a structural estimation method based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) and willingness-to-sell (WTS) distributions. The data consist only of whether or not trade takes place, if it does, the negotiated price.  Our method provides accurate estimates when applied to both synthetic and real data sets. We also show how the WTP and WTS estimates can be used to improve revenues for the seller by optimally setting reserve prices on negotiations.
