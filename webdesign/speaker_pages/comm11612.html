Title: Estimating Likelihood of Terrorist Attacks by Modeling Terrorist Objectives and Values<br>Author: Richard John, Associate Professor, University of Southern California, Department of Psychology, MC-1061, University Park, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-1061, United States, richardj@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Heather Rosoff<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Current methods for terrorism risk assessment focus on target vulnerability, terrorist capability, and attack consequence, largely ignoring terrorist motivations.  Analogous to PRA methods that use physical, chemical and biological models to estimate key uncertainties, we represent terrorist motivations with utility models of terrorist objectives and values that include uncertainties in attack outcome and terrorist values (e.g., risk attitude and trade-offs among conflicting objectives).
