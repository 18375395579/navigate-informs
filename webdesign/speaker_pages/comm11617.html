Berkeley, NUS Business School, Singapore, Singapore, andrewlim@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Poomyos Wimonkittiwat</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present an approach for dynamic utility maximization when asset prices are modulated by a hidden Markov model with unknown transition matrix and observation statistics that combines Gibbs' sampling with approximations of the cost-to-go function in the dynamic programming. Optimality bounds are also presented.</br>
