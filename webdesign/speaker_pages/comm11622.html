Rural Road, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, qli30@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mohan Gopalakrishnan, Srimathy Mohan, Antonios Printezis, John Fowler</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Based on an in-depth study of a catheterization facility within a large hospital organization in Arizona, we will present the scheduling problem and design a simulation model to support the construction and revision process of their daily scheduling activities. We use historical data to evaluate the performance of our scheduling approach in terms of utilization, staff overtime and patient waiting time.</br>
