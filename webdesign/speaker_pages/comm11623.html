Title: Analysis of a Threshold-based Node Sleep Scheduling Policy for Energy Harvesting Sensor Networks<br>Author: Arupa Mohapatra, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, arupa@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Natarajan Gautam<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Autonomous wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting nodes are gaining prominence in long-lived remote surveillance applications.  Node sleep scheduling is a popular approach to ensure “energy-neutral?operation in these networks. We present a fluid model based analysis of performance of such a network under a threshold based sleep scheduling policy.
