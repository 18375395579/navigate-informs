Title: A Demand Forecasting Model Using Financial Indicators and Experts' Input<br>Author: Vishal Gaur, Cornell University, vg77@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nikolay Osadchiy, Sridhar Seshadri<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a forecast evolution model to investigate the correlation between the sales volume of a retailer and the state of the economy, characterized by the return on an aggregated financial index. We test this model on a panel data of sales forecast evolution for 214 US retailers over 10 years, each year containing multiple forecasts of varying terms. Our model is useful for demand forecasting, operational planning, and hedging demand risk.
