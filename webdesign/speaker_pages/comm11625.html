Challenges Include: changes in only a few attributes (or only in sub-regions), big data is dirty data, no models  (nonlinearities).  A robust, scalable strategy will be presented that can be applied to different data representations such as traditional time-ordered data, events as point-processes in a high-dimensional space (of numerical and categorical attributes), or network transactions.</br>
