Title: Successful Case Study for Integration between Business and Analytics in the Propylene Value Chain<br>Author: Nicaleen Van der Westhuizen, Sasol Technology, Synfuels Road, Secunda, South Africa, nica.vanderwesthuizen@sasol.com<br>Coauthor(s): Gerrit Streicher, Marlize Meyer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Molecules meant for chemical manufacturing were lost along a very integrated and dynamic value chain serving multiple businesses. Sound engineering principles were incorporated in an Excel based mass balance tool which was used hand in hand with an integrated simulation model of the Propylene Value chain. The combined analytics capability were able to identify pinch points and constrains in the value chain under different conditions and ultimately a road map for project implementation.
