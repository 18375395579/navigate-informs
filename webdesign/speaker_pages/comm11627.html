Title: Optimizing Radiation Delivery Schedules for Gliomas<br>Author: Kevin Leder, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, Kevin.Leder@me.umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ken Pitter, Eric Holland, Franziska Michor<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We construct a model to study the response of gliomas to radiation therapy. In particular, we consider a model considering two distinct cell populations, a slow growing radio-resistant stem cell population and a faster growing radio-sensitive progenitor cell population.  Cells dynamically switch back and forth between these two states in response to radiation doses. In the context of this model we identify near optimal dosing schedules, and compare their performance to standard therapies.
