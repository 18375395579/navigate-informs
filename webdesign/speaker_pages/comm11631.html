<br>Title: Bayesian Models for Executives' Environmental Uncertainty after 9/11</br><br>Author: Ehsan Soofi, Professor, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, PO Box 742, Milwaukee, WI, United States of America, esoofi@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Nystrom, Masoud Yasai-Ardekani</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Shortly after 9/11, we solicited probabilities from 93 executives to study their uncertainties about the state of future economy, its effects on the organizations, and organizational ability to respond. The data provide two bivariate marginal distributions. The trivariate distributions of state-effect-response are imputed by maximum entropy. Uncertainty about probabilities is modeled using a Dirichlet model and by a Bayesian hierarchical model.  A set of uncertainty tableaux present the results.</br>
