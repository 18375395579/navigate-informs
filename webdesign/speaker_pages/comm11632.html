Title: Classification of Discrete Event Simulation Models and Output: Creating a Sufficient Model Set<br>Author: Kathryn Hoad, Research Fellow, Warwick Business School, The University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom, kathryn.hoad@wbs.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Ruth Davies, Stewart Robinson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This presentation describes the creation of a representative and sufficient set of models/output data that can be used by discrete event simulation researchers to test their research ideas. The identification of certain DES model/output characteristics is described, as is the creation of a classification system for each general type of model/output encountered in 'real life' DES modelling. The process of setting up this classification system is explained and the classification tables outlined.
