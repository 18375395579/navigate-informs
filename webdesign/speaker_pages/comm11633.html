Initial beliefs are based on population characteristics. Estimates of the time to nadir, and nadir level (which might be linked to maximal tumor regression) are updated as new information becomes available. The model could be used as input in the monitoring and treatment decision making process of individual prostate cancer patients as well as a tool to help schedule radiation therapy across patients.</br>
