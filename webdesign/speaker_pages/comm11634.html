System uncertainty models are used to evaluate such protocols: calibration using mean of replicate measurements; calibration based on acceptance when quality control specimens were within one standard deviation of target. The effect of calibrator concentrations on assay uncertainty was studied, and calibrator concentrations minimizing uncertainty at specific concentration levels were identified.</br>
