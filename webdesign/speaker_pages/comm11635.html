<br>Title: Some Limit Theorems for a Cumulative Degradation Process</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Kharoufeh, Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, jkharouf@pitt.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present transient and asymptotic reliability measures for a cumulative degradation process resulting from Markov-modulated wear and damage-inducing shocks of random magnitude.  The asymptotic results lead to computationally-expedient approximations for remaining life distributions suitable for use within a real-time prognostics framework.  A few numerical illustrations are provided.</br>
