<br>Title: Residue-residue Hydrophobic Contact Prediction for Alpha-helical Proteins Via MILP Optimization</br><br>Author: Christodoulos Floudas, Stephen C. Macaleer '63 Professor in Engineering and Applied Science, Princeton University, Department of Chemical Engineering, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, floudas@titan.princeton.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A new optimization-based method is presented to predict the hydrophobic residue contacts in alpha-helical proteins. These residue contacts are highly useful in narrowing down the conformational space searched by protein structure prediction algorithms. The proposed approach uses a high resolution distance dependent force field to calculate the interaction energy between different residues of a protein.</br>
