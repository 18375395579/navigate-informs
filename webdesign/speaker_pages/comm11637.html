Title: Energy Modeling at the Machine Level<br>Author: Janet Twomey, Wichita State University, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, KS, 67260-0035, United States, janet.twomey@wichita.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haitao Liao, Lawrence Whitman, Bayram Yildirim<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk reports on a framework for energy collection and operational models at the machine level.  The framework gives detailed energy profiles of industrial equipment.  That detailed profile not only provides an accurate assessment of energy consumed for a given material, machine, and part geometry, but also provides significant information for prescribing energy reduction strategies at the machine level.  A description of the framework is provided, as well as scheduling intervention strategies for turning equipment ON/OFF during idle periods.  An application to lower energy consumption at a Wichita, KS aircraft supplier is given for illustrative purposes. The limitations of the current results and ongoing research at the machine level are described, and the future research at the facility and enterprise level are discussed. This research has been supported by NSF DMI- 0537839 grant.
