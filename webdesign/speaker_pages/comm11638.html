Title: Integrated Activity-Based Modeling and Dynamic Traffic Micro-Assignment Simulator<br>Author: Travis Waller, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States, S.Travis.Waller@engr.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chandra Bhat<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk will discuss research related to an integrated Activity-Based/DTA model (CEMDAP and VISTA).  Given the disaggregate data on socio-demographics, activity-travel environment and prescribed policy actions for the base year, CEMDAP generates detailed activity-travel patterns for each individual in a population which serve as inputs for the integrated DTA model. Technical, computational, and practical issues involved in this demand-supply integration problem will be discussed.
