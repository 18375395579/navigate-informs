Title: Location-allocation under Uncertainty Applied to Disaster Operations Management<br>Author: Raha Akhavan-Tabatabaei, Assistant Professor, Universidad de los Andes, Cra 1 Este No 19A - 40, Bogota, Colombia, r.akhavan@uniandes.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): Andrés L. Medaglia, Ridley Morales<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Strategically locating emergency response facilities based on regional risk maps can reduce the impact of a disaster on communities. We model a general location-allocation problem for emergency response as a capacitated facility location problem under uncertainty. To solve the model, we use two-stage stochastic programming with side constraints to minimize the total expected cost and limit the downside risks. We illustrate our methodology using data from the city of Bogot?(Colombia).
