<br>Title: Incorporation of Some Gd&T Aspects into Stream of Variation Analysis for Multistage Assembly Processes</br><br>Author: Zhenyu (James) Kong, Assistant Professor, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States, james.kong@okstate.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A large body of research has been conducted in variation propagation for multistage assembly processes. Most of them were mainly focused on the process modeling, i.e., how the obtain the coefficient matrix which represents the linear relationship between input variable (error sources such as tooling variation) tolerance and output variable (measurement points) variation. For modeling of the input variable tolerance, the assumptions of linear and independent tolerances are made. However, these assumptions may bring some conflicts when applying the model for real applications. This paper discusses some GD&T aspects, such as composite tolerances, circular tolerances, bonus tolerances and clearance tolerance which are widely used in real industrial applications. The mathematical modeling of these tolerances is developed and incorporated into the developed 3D stream of variation analysis (SOVA) model. A few case studies are provided which use the commercial Monte Carlo simulation software as bench mark to validate the results from SOVA. The reasonably consistent comparison results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.</br>
