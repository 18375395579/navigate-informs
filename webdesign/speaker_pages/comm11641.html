Title: Operations, Disruptions and Recovery<br>Author: Goran Stojkovic, Senior Operations Research Analyst, Jeppesen, 1800 McGill College Avenue, Suite 1930, Montreal, QC, H3A 3J6, Canada, Goran.Stojkovic@jeppesen.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In operations disruption management, multiple parties are changing data simultaneously and the preferred approach to solve the  disruption recovery problem usually varies by user. The lack of  industry best practices and standards makes it hard to evaluate  generated solutions and perform convincing benchmarks. We propose a  standard benchmarking process based on an automated testing  environment and a Recovery Performance Indicator (RPI) model in order  to show the added value to the customer.
