This has caused higher risk and less investment in solar power generation. We propose an original SREC price model, and provide a dynamic programming solution algorithm. Our model includes a feedback mechanism for generation response to market prices. Finally, after calibrating our model to reproduce historical prices, we analyse and propose alternative market mechanisms capable of improving market performance.</br>
