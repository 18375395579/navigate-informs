Title: Analysis of High-resolution of NMR Spectra in the Complex Wavelet Transform Domain<br>Author: Seoung Bum Kim, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Arlington, 500 W. First Street, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, sbkim@uta.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Successful identification of the important metabolite features in high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra is a crucial task for the discovery of biomarkers that have the potential for early diagnosis of disease and subsequent monitoring of its progression.  In the present study we have proposed to use a complex wavelet transform combined with the false discovery rate-based feature selection method to improve feature selection and classification of high-resolution NMR spectra.
