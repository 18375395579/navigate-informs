Title: Calibration of Building Energy Model under Uncertainty<br>Author: Huafen Hu, Assistant Professor, Portland State University, 1930 SW 4th Ave, Room 400, Portland, OR, 97201, United States of America, hu@cecs.pdx.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Calibrated building model is playing a more significant role in building retrofit and control but yet remains to be an art rather than a science due to the inherent nonlinearity and uncertainty in building behavior. This study presents a simple but effective Monte Carlo approach that delivers calibrated building models by a walk-through audit. A university building is used to demonstrate the strength and robustness of the approach to unavoidable noise/disturbance in building model calibration.
