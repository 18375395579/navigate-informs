Title: Optimizing Pandemic Control Strategies using Simulation Meta-modeling<br>Author: Michael Beeler, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, mfbeeler@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Carter, Dionne Aleman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Pandemic simulations can be so high-dimensional that it is difficult for conventional designed experiments to explore the full space of possible disease parameters, population characteristics, and simulated pandemic responses. Stochastic kriging, an alternative simulation meta-modeling technique, is used to search the simulation design space for good pandemic control strategies and construct a response surface covering a range of possible future scenarios.
