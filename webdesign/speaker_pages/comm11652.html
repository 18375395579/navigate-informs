<br>Title: Diagnosis of Process and Sensor Faults in Manufacturing Processes</br><br>Author: Shan Li, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, shanli@engineering.uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yong Chen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian variable selection based diagnosis approach to identify process mean shift fault and sensor mean shift fault simultaneously in manufacturing processes. The potential process faults and sensor faults always outnumbers the number of sensor measurements. The proposed approach utilizes the fact that only a few process and sensor faults can occur simultaneously. A guideline on how to select the values of hyperparameters in the Bayesian variable selection is also given.</br>
