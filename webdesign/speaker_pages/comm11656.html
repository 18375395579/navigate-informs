Title: Dulles Metrorail - Congestion Mitigation Plan Microsimulation<br>Author: John Duesing, Senior Associate, Cambridge Systematics, 405 Lexington Avenue, 26th Floor, New York, NY, 10174, United States, jduesing@camsys.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Cambridge Systematics, as the developer of the Tyson’s Corner Travel Demand Model for the County of Fairfax, developed a methodology for assessing the diversions and re-routing that will result from the construction of the Metrorail Orange line. We proposed integration of the Tyson’s Corner demand model with a VISSIM traffic microsimulation model of the study area to adequately evaluate the traffic impacts in the corridor. This integration will allow for modal shifts, time period shifts, as well as route shifts that will occur due to construction impacts.
