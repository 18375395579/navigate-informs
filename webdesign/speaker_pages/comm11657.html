Title: Operations Research and the Revolution in Aggregate Economics<br>Author: Edward C Prescott, W.P. Carey Chaired Professor of Economics, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, United States of America<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The extension of recursive methods to dynamic equilibrium modeling spawned a revolution in aggregate economics. This revolution has resulted in aggregate economics becoming, like physics, a hard science and not exercises in storytelling.  Operations research played a major role in the development of practical methods to model dynamic aggregate economic phenomena and to predict the consequences of policy regimes.  I learned about recursive methods when obtaining a Master’s Degree in Operations Research at Case Institute of Technology in 1962-63. Of particular importance were the tools I mastered in a queuing course taught by Maurice Sasieni, though I learned some importance lessons from Russell Ackoff in scientific methodology. The reason that these tools were important was that there were rational people in some of the models.  This was in sharp contrast with the now defunct field of Keynesian macroeconomics, where economists searched for the dynamic system governing the evolution of the national income and product accounts statistics and other aggregate statistics.  Robert E. Lucas tried to develop economic foundations for these empirically determined, policy-invariant, dynamic systems and found that the existence of such systems was inconsistent with dynamic economic theory.  Subsequently recursive methods were used to develop a quantitative theory of aggregate fluctuations and other aggregate phenomena.
