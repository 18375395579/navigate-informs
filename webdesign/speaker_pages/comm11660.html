Title: SPC for Monitoring Nonlinear Profiles Using Wavelets and B-splines<br>Author: Shing Chang, Associate Professor, Kansas State University, Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Eng, changs@ksu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A statistical process control framework is proposed to monitor nonlinear profiles. The proposed methodology aims at identifying mean shifts or the shape changes in a profile. Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) is applied to separate variation or noise from profile contours. A B-spline model is then used to further reduce problem dimension.
