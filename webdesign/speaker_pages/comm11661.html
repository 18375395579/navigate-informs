<br>Title: A Finite-mixture Modeling Approach to the Management of Transportation Infrastructure Systems</br><br>Author: Pablo Durango-Cohen, Assistant Professor, Northwestern University, pdc@northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Maintenance optimization models rely on the specification of a perfect deterioration model. This can lead to inadequate characterizations due to population heterogeneity or epistemic uncertainty, and consequently to the implementation of inefficient policies.  We propose a framework where deterioration is represented by a finite-mixture model.  Policies are obtained by solving a partially-observable.  Numerical examples illustrate the convergence and effectiveness of the approach.</br>
