Title: Platoon based Arterial Route Travel Time Estimation using Mobile Sensor Data<br>Author: Peng Hao, RPI, 12 25th ST, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, haop@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuegang Ban<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The authors aim to estimate the arterial corridor travel times using sample travel time data from mobile sensors. For the link segment, the platoon dispersion model is applied to compute the link travel time and arrival rate at downstream intersection. For the intersection area, the derived time-dependent arrival pattern is utilized to construct the dynamic delay pattern. This model is calibrated and tested using NGSIM data set.
