<br>Title: Using Expert Assessments to Estimate Operational Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Saurabh Bansal, Pennsylvania State University, 405 Business Building, University Park, PA, United States of America, sub32@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Genaro Gutierrez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In industries with a rapid innovation rate, historical data seldom exists to provide credible probability distributions. We develop a systematic approach to use subjective estimates of fractiles provided by experts to obtain estimates of the mean and variance of probability distributions. We illustrate the application of the theory developed using an ongoing implementation at a seed corn producer for the estimation of yield uncertainty.</br>
