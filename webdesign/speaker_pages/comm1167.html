Title: Risk Trade-offs between Duration and Resource Idleness in Linear Projects<br>Author: Pandelis Ipsilandis, Professor, Technological Education Institute of Larissa, School of Business, Larissa, 41110, Greece, ipsil@teilar.gr<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Linear repetitive projects employ resources used in a sequential manner. Thus effective resource management is very important both in terms of project cost and duration. Existing methodologies (CPM, RSM) optimize the schedule with respect to a single factor, duration or work continuity. Here we present a multi objective model that takes into consideration cost elements regarding duration, idle time of resources, and delays in unit deliverable's, to define a range of alternative schedules.
