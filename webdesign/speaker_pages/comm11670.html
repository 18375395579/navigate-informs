Title: Ranking Pandemic Interventions via Multilevel Sensitivity Analysis of Model Results<br>Author: Patrick Finley, Complex Systems Engineer, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800 MS 1198, Albuquerque, NM, 87110, United States of America, pdfinle@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Moore, Greg Lambert, Leland Evans, Richard Martinello, Carter Mecher, Robert Glass, Victoria Davey<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Multilevel sensitivity analyses (SA) of pandemic disease models are used to rank potential mitigation strategies.  Novel SA methods based on weighted Levenschtein-edit distances, penalized multinomial logistic regression, and stochastic dominance of Gaussian process surfaces produce mitigation effectiveness rankings which vary in response to demographic and contact-network parameters.  If the ranking criterion is changed from total infected to $/QALY, intervention strategy rankings also change.
