Title: A Multiple Services Lifetime Value Model<br>Author: Howard Dover, Salisbury University, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD, 21801, United States of America, hfdover@salisbury.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ram Rao, B.P.S. Murthi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We address the challenge of computing lifetime value in the presence of multiple interdependent streams of profit.  We propose a multi-state, semi-Markovian model to capture the dependency between contractual product spells.  The advantages of this model specification versus other methods, like correlated models, are explored using data from an online content provider.   The MSCLV model allows firms with more than one contractual relationship to predict the customer lifetime value.
