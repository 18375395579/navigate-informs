Title: Therapeutic Optimization Considering Medical Research and Development<br>Author: Steven Shechter, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Steven.Shechter@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Oguzhan Alagoz<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Most patient-level decision models do not consider the downstream availability of new treatment options coming out of the research and development pipeline.  We present a Markov Decision Process model for patient treatment, which incorporates uncertainty around the development of new therapies, and show how optimal values and policies compare between models that do and do not consider the R&D dynamic.  We present structural properties as well as results from a numerical example for treating HIV.
