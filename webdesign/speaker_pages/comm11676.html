The sampled posterior optimization programs are constructed using metamodels to determine the posterior distribution of the optimal dosage. The goal is to maximize the benefit of using the dosage and simultaneously control the side effects, explicitly for each individual subject, with a prescribed posterior probability guarantee.</br>
