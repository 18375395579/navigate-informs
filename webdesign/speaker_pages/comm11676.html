Title: Determining the Optimal Dosage Using Metamodeling Techniques<br>Author: Xi Chen, Assistant Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, Statistical Sciences & Operations Resear, 1015 Floyd Avenue, Grace E. Harris Hall, Richmond, VA, 23284-3083, United States of America, xchen4@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edward Boone<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This talk is about determining the optimal dosage while controlling for tolerable side effects through metamodeling techniques with a Bayesian perspective. The sampled posterior optimization programs are constructed using metamodels to determine the posterior distribution of the optimal dosage. The goal is to maximize the benefit of using the dosage and simultaneously control the side effects, explicitly for each individual subject, with a prescribed posterior probability guarantee.
