<br>Title: GCG 1.0 - A Generic Branch-cut-and-price Solver</br><br>Author: Gerald Gamrath, Research Assistant, Zuse-Institut Berlin, Takustr 7, Berlin, 14199, Germany, gamrath@zib.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Martin Bergner, Marco Lübbecke, Christian Puchert</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We implemented GCG, a branch-cut-and-price solver based on the branch-cut-and-price framework SCIP.  Given a MIP, GCG performs a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation (based on user input, or a reformulation suggested by the solver) and does a full branch-cut-and-price search. It inherits advanced MIP solving features from SCIP, extended by plugins using both the original and the extended formulation.  We report on our computational experiments and discuss what can be learned from a generic solver.</br>
