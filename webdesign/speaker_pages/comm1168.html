Title: Monitoring Data Quality in Distributed Data Warehouses with Delays<br>Author: Ilona Murynets, PhD Student, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States of America, imurynet@stevens.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Jiang, Rong Duan, S. Tom Au<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Poor data quality and the lack of integration in data warehouse (DWH) make it difficult for business users to obtain a consistent view of business processes.   To monitor operational data feeding systems, this paper proposes a statistical model for  data feeding systems from heterogeneous databases to a central DWH. An online statistical process control (SPC) procedure is developed to identify  inconsistencies in the feeding data.
