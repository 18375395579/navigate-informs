<br>Title: Quantitative Risk Assessment of Animal Antibiotics at the Animal Health Institute</br><br>Author: Tony Cox, President, Cox Associates, 503 Franklin Street, Denver, CO, 80218, United States, tcoxdenver@aol.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The Animal Health Institute (AHI) recently applied OR to quantify impacts on human health from continued use of animal antibiotics.  Unexpectedly, quantitative models showed miniscule risks to human health, but significant potential health benefits from reduced animal and human illnesses.  These new models and methods let industry and regulatory decision-makers quantify and compare human health impacts of alternative animal antibiotic uses, to better protect human and animal health.</br>
