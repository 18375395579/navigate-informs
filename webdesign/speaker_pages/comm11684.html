Congestion on roads is a function of disaster type and is a major deterrent for ambulance routing. We model congestion using stochastic simulation, which along with casualty clusters are used to reallocate hospital capacities via an optimization model. This is used for ambulance scheduling and routing. Results are demonstrated via case-studies.
