<br>Title: Modeling the Spatio-temporal Dynamics of Local Wind Fields at a Wind Farm</br><br>Author: Arash Pourhabib, Research Assistant, Texas A&M University, TAMU 3131, College Station, TX, 77840, United States of America, arash.pourhabib@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding, Jianhua Huang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Viable power system operations hinge on accurate short-term wind speed forecast. We present a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) model for analyzing local wind fields for the purpose of wind speed forecast. The SDE model takes into account both spatial and temporal dependencies among wind speeds measured at different locations. Using discretization and least square techniques, we solve the proposed SDE and demonstrate its usefulness over time series practice for wind speed forecast.</br>
