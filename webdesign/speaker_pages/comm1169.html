<br>Title: Gaussian Process Models for Computer Experiments With Qualitative and Quantitative Factors</br><br>Author: Zhiguang Qian, Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1220 Medical Sciences Center, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, zhiguang@stat.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff C. F. Wu, Huaiqing Wu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Modeling experiments with qualitative and quantitative factors is an important but unsolved issue in computer modeling. Some Gaussian process models that can accomodate both qualitative and quantitative facotors are proposed. A real example for modeling the thermal distribution in a data center is used to illustrate the proposed models.</br>
