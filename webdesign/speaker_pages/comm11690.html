Title: Estimating Link-based Traffic Flow Dynamics from Bluetooth and GPS Sensor Data: A  Linear Programming Reformulation<br>Author: Xuesong Zhou, University of Utah, MCE Building 2135, 110 S. Central Campus Dr., Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, xzhou99@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jiangtao Liu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This talk presents a new linear programming formulation to utilize multiple data sources, including link count, travel time, OD split fractions from Bluetooth and GPS data, to estimate dynamic traffic OD matrices. A real-world test case is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model.
