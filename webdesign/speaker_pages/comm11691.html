Title: Applying Price Directed Decomposition to Hierarchical Forest Planning Models<br>Author: Sam Pittman, Operations Research Analyst, Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, WTC 1B20 PO Box 9777, Federal Way, WA, 98063, United States, sam.pittman@weyerhaeuser.com<br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Bare, D. Briggs<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Hierarchical production models offer a means of better managing large and complex forest planning models dealing with forest-wide and landscape level detail. In this talk, Lagrangian relaxation is used to formulate a hierarchical model that maximizes the net present value of harvest incomes while recognizing specific geographical units that are subject to harvest flow and green-up constraints. The model is solved using a modified Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition/column generation routine.
