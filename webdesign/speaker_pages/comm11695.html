Title: Using Weather Forecast Information to Model Stochastic Evolution of Terminal Capacity<br>Author: Yoonjin Yoon, UC Berkeley, 107D McLaughlin Hall, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, yoonjin@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Stochastic forecasts of airport terminal capacities utilize a set of capacity scenarios. In previous research, capacity scenarios are generated solely from the historical capacity profiles, such as historical AAR. In this talk, we consider how to incorporate the weather forecast information, to tailor capacity scenarios to a specific day-of operation. Data mining is used to generate the capacity scenarios and update the probabilistic scenarios.
