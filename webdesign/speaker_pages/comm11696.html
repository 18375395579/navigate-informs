Title: A Colorectal Cancer Screening Model Incorporating Patient Choice<br>Author: Maria Mayorga, Clemson University, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, mayorga@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kristen Hassmiler-Lich<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Despite its demonstrated effectiveness, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is sub-optimal.  Furthermore, most studies comparing different screening recommendations assume that all patients behave the same.  We use a validated US-level agent-based model (ABM) that had incorporates patient preferences for alternate screening compliance as well as for screening modalities, thus accounting for patient heterogeneity.  Cost effectiveness analyses are conducted using North Carolina claims data.
