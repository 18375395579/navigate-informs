Title: Large-Scale Genomic Pattern Recognition and Classification for Cancer Prediction<br>Author: Eva K. Lee, Associate Professor & Director, Georgia Institute of Technology, Center for OR in Medicine & HealthCare, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jin Shi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis is critical to successful treatment of cancer. In this talk, we first present pattern recognition algorithms in finding hidden sequence signatures in the human genome that are related to cancer formation. Next using these patterns, an optimization-based classification model is used to classify normal patients versus cancer patients and develop the predictive rule, which can then be used for early cancer diagnosis for future patients.
