Title: Traveling Salesman Tour Length Estimation on General Graphs<br>Author: Bahar Cavdar, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Main Building, Office: 447, Atlanta, Ge, 30332, United States of America, baharca@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joel Sokol<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: There are many models in the literature to estimate the optimal Traveling Salesman tour length. However, these models are engineered for uniform random graphs. What if we have a general graph where the nodes follow a specific pattern? We develop a new tour length estimation model which captures the different node scatter than uniformity and discuss the implementation of the model into heuristic algorithms to improve the tour quality.
