Title: Bayesian Mean and Variance Wavelet Thresholding for Multiple Complicated Functional Data<br>Author: Jye-Chyi (JC) Lu, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30022, United States, jclu@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Myong K. Jeong, Cuizhen Shen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to describe data trend and variation for several complicated functional curves.  In particular, a wavelet based random-effect model enables us to characterizes local variations between curves. Our work develops a wavelet thresholding procedure for both mean and variance parameters. Bayes factors makes the hypothesis testing for parameter thresholding simple. A real-life example from antenna manufacturing illustrates the developed methods.
