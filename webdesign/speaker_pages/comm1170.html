Jeong, Cuizhen Shen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This talk uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to describe data trend and variation for several complicated functional curves.  In particular, a wavelet based random-effect model enables us to characterizes local variations between curves. Our work develops a wavelet thresholding procedure for both mean and variance parameters. Bayes factors makes the hypothesis testing for parameter thresholding simple. A real-life example from antenna manufacturing illustrates the developed methods.</br>
