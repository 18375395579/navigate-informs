We discuss issues that arise when modeling  the probability of floods,  the expected damage and measures to prevent floods. Our aim is to  minimize the sum of future investing costs and expected damage over a long period (of about 300 years).  We present some MINLP optimization models and a dynamic programming  model, as well as some computational results.</br>
