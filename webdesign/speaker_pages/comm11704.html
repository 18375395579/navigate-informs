Title: Computational Issues in the Analysis of Call Center Arrivals<br>Author: Refik Soyer, George Washington University, Decision Sciences Dept Funger Hall  415, School of Business, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, soyer@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Murat Tarimcilar, Fabrizio Ruggeri<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk we consider analysis of call center arrivals that are mostly linked to individual advertisements. We discuss the problem of prediction for aggregate arrivals based on advertisement specific data and illustrate how these predictions can be developed in a Bayesian analysis. We also address the issue of how to deal with call arrival data that are not 100% linked to ads. We consider this as a missing data problem and develop a data augmentation  algorithm for the Bayesian analysis.
