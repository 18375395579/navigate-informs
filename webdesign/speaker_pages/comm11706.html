Title: A Mixed Integer Programming Approach to Improve Operational Scheduling of Radiation Therapists<br>Author: Vincent Chow, Operations Research Analyst, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 600 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC, V5Z4E6, Canada, vchow@bccancer.bc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Pablo Santibanez, Travis Nordin, John French, Martin Puterman, Scott Tyldesley<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Radiation therapists (RTs) are integral to cancer care, performing tasks such as imaging, treatment planning and delivery. We present a mixed integer programming model to create RT schedules with daily assignments. Results from implementation at a mid-size center in Western Canada show 30% to 40% improvement in a range of quality metrics. The model is packaged into a customized web-based scheduling platform and used by the RT manager on a regular basis.
