After the serious flood in 1953 a cost-benefit model was developed by van Dantzig to determine optimal dike heights. Recently, Eijgenraam improved and extended van Dantzig’s model, to update the dike investment plan.     We show how Eijgenraam’s approach can be modeled as an MINLP problem. The goal is to minimize the sum of the expected loss for flooding and the costs of heightening the dikes. Preliminary numerical results are given. This talk extends results presented in the previous talk of this session to the multi-segment case.</br>
