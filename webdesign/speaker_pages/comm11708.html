Title: GIS-based Construction of a Topographical Road Graph for Bicycle Tour Routes<br>Author: Katherine Carl, Graduate Teaching Associate, University of Arizona, 825 E. 5th Street, Apt. 203A, Tucson, AZ, 85719, United States of America, kcarl@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Moshe Dror<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper describes the algorithmic components of transforming road map data into an enhanced topographical road graph using polyline data from the OpenStreetMap, elevation data from a Digital Elevation Model, and a model of perceived exertion (PE) for bicyclists of different levels of expertise.  The graph constructed allows for the calculation of the PE of any sequence of road segments for bicyclists of different levels of expertise and facilitates the construction of a path of minimal PE.
