<br>Title: Streaming vs. Downloading of Online Music: Complements or Substitutes?</br><br>Author: Jui Ramaprasad, Assistant Professor, McGill University, Desautels Faculty of Managemen, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, jui.ramaprasad@mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sanjeev Dewan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Online music models have evolved over the past decade, from a single option of purchasing full albums to downloading and streaming of individual songs. Using streaming and radio play data for a set of songs released in early 2011, we examine the relationship between streaming and downloading using the literature on innovation co-diffusion as our framework. Our results shed light on whether streaming and downloading are substitutes or complements to one another.</br>
