However, resource constraints and limited access, makes it impossible to directly measure traffic on all the links. We  introduce a physically interpretable, probabilistic model of network-wide traffic that can be used in conjunction with easily obtainable measurements to provide more accurate prediction than is possible with only the inexpensive measurements.</br>
