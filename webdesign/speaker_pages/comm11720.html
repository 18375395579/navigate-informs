Title: Active Model Adjustment for Dynamic Decision Making: Generic Approaches and Simulation Experiments<br>Author: Jörn Schönberger, Dr., University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany, jsb@uni-bremen.de<br>Coauthor(s): Herbert Kopfer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In a dynamic decision problem, once made decisions require revision or confirmation after the considered decision situation has changed. Rolling horizon planning consecutively re-solves a mathematical model and the model is updated reactively driven only by the changed problem data. Generic approaches to update the decision model actively by exploiting solution evaluation results to adjust parameters in the decision model are presented. The predominance of the active approach is demonstrated.
