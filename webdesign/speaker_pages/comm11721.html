Ryser, Duke University, United States of America, ryser@math.duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin McGoff, Evan Myers, David Sivakoff, David Herzog, Rick Durrett</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Approximately 5% of all cancers worldwide are caused by infection with the sexually transmitted Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Acknowledging that sexual network structure and temporal ordering of relationships play a crucial role in HPV transmission, we develop a dynamic random graph model for adolescent sexual networks. Incorporating the HPV infection dynamics, we then use the model to assess efficacy of competing vaccination policies.</br>
