Title: Using Kriging to Estimate Network Performance in Wireless Local Area Networks<br>Author: Abdullah Konak, Assistant Professor, Penn State - Berks, Tulpehocken Road, Reading, PA, 19610, United States, konak@psu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This research proposes an approach based on Kriging, which is a regression technique used in geostatistics to interpolate data, to estimate the performance indicators of wireless local area networks such as signal strength, interference, and data rate.  The approach aims to remedy some drawbacks of the existing site survey software.
