Title: An Economic Analysis of Brazil Fuel Policies, Consumption and Choice of Fuel, and Emission Impacts<br>Author: Hector Nunez, Universtiy of Illinois, nunez5@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hayri Onal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We use an economic equilibrium model to analyze the impacts of recent changes in Brazil fuel policies and strong demand in world sugar markets. We simulate consumers?driving demand and fuel choices in response to the reduced blend rate and taxes, and determine land use changes, GHG emissions, and welfare implications. Our results show that despite the reduction in driving demand, GHG emission from Brazil would increase significantly due to the consumption of a more carbon intensive fuel blend.
