<br>Title: Formulating and Solving Call Center Scheduling Models in Excel</br><br>Author: Thomas Robbins, Assistant Professor, East Carolina University, 3212 Bate Building, Greenville, NC, 27858, United States of America, robbinst@ecu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Call center scheduling models present a significant challenge to operations researchers and practitioners alike.   Though conceptually simple to describe, straightforward scheduling options create a combinatorial explosion that makes model difficult to solve to optimality.  We examine the drivers of complexity and investigate the feasibility of solving these models in Excel.  We present two different formulations; a standard set-covering model and a more complex global constraint model.</br>
