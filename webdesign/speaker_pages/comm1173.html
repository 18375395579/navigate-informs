Title: Simulating the Western Electricity System’s Response to a Carbon Market<br>Author: Andrew Ford, Professor, Washington State University, Troy Hall 311, Pullman, WA, 99164-4430, United States, forda@wsu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper describes a computer simulation analysis of a  cap and trade market to reduce carbon emissions in the electricity system in the western USA and Canada.  The simulations show a dramatic reductions in carbon emissions over the next two decades. This analysis is made possible by a novel, interdisciplinary combination of system dynamics and power systems engineering methods.
