Title: A One-class Classification Approach for Multivariate Statistical Process Control<br>Author: Thuntee Sukchotrat, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Texas at Arlington, The University of Texas at Arlington, PO Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, tsukchotrat@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The problems of one-class classification (OCC) have received attentions from various fields. We propose a OCC approach to improve phase I and phase II analysis in multivariate statistical process control (SPC). We introduced the chart statistic that represents the degree of being an outlier from the OCC result. The control limit is established using the user-specified level of significance on a quantile basis. This is an attempt to bring the advantages of OCC techniques to solve SPC problems.
