Title: A Competitive Model of Price Dispersion in Online Retailing<br>Author: Jan Stallaert, Associate Professor, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Road, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States, jan.stallaert@business.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Zhang, Sulin Ba<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a competitive model, based on online retailers?differentiation, to explain price dispersion. We empirically test the predictions of this model and find that the model is a viable alternative to the hedonic price model. In addition, our competitive model is able to predict and explain observations that are seemingly inconsistent with a hedonic model.
