Title: Cross-Domain Model Building and Validation to Reinforce Understanding of Nanowire Weight Kinetics<br>Author: Li Wang, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Ave., RM 236, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, wang40@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Qiang Huang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Understanding nanostructure growth faces issues of limited data, lack of physical knowledge, and large process uncertainties. These issues result in modeling difficulty because a large pool of candidate models almost fit the data equally well. In this talk, we present a new cross-domain model building and validation approach to address these challenges for scalable nanomanufacturing.
