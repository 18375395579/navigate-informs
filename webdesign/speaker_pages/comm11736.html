Title: Predictive Stream Mining Challenges at NSA<br>Author: Kevin Drummey, Technical Director, National Security Agency/Enterprise Operations Research, Modeling & Simulation Group, 7923 Severn Hills Way, Severn, MD, 21144, United States of America, kwdrumm@nsa.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this presentation, we describe some of the unique challenges faced by the National Security Agency when mining raw data in a near-real-time environment for items of interest. We consider items based on metadata associated with particular events, where the metadata is generated from multiple, multimedia, raw data sources. We are motivated by our customers' limited time, resources, and data storage. Our main goal is near-real-time automation of the predictive modeling process.
