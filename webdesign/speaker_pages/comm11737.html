Title: Evaluating Flexible Capacity Across Multiple Markets<br>Author: John Birge, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, John.Birge@ChicagoGSB.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Flexible capacity that can respond to demand, supply, and pricing variations across multiple markets presents challenges for evaluation.  This talk will focus on evaluating capacity in different markets in the context of exchange rate uncertainty. Assuming an underlying stochastic exchange rate process, we will present a general analytical framework that allows characterization of parameter sensitivities and bounds on the value of capacity with limited information.
