Title: A Study of Rare Events in Finance<br>Author: Ionut Florescu, Assistant Professor, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on The Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States of America, ifloresc@stevens.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this work we investigate financial events where the price shows large changes with relatively small volume. These event are detected in real time and the methodology is compared with two other ways to detect extrema of multivariate distributions: p-efficient points and ziggurat method. We also investigate the relationship between these events and lack of liquidity on the market which is measured using the aggressor indicator available in certain exchange data.
