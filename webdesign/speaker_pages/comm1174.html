<br>Title: A Simulation-based Transit Assignment Model</br><br>Author: Mark Hickman, Associate Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E. Second Street, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States of America, mhickman@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alireza Khani</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In the context of a scheduled fixed-route transit service, we explore a more realistic passenger assignment using an integrated traffic and transit simulation tool to generate transit vehicle trajectories. Using these trajectories, we assign transit passengers to the network using either a trip-based shortest path or a trip-based hyperpath assignment. The simulation model and the associated transit assignment methods are illustrated on a case study from Sacramento, California.</br>
