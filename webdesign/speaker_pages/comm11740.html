Title: Modeling State-dependent Priorities of Malicious Agents<br>Author: Sumitra Sri Bhashyam, PhD Candidate, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London, United Kingdom, S.Sribhashyam@lse.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Gilberto Montibeller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: One way to anticipate terrorists?malicious actions is to consider their values when modeling their decisions - such values will drive their choices. Using multi-attribute utility theory we suggest modeling dynamic preferences of a malicious agent by incorporating state-dependent weights to account for preference change caused by exogenous triggers and representing the environment as a system dynamics model. We explore its use in the context of counter-terrorism analysis.
