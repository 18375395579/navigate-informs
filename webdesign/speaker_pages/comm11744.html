Title: Solving Beam-Angle Selection and Dose Optimization Simultaneously via High-Throughput Computing<br>Author: Hao Zhang, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 922 Erin St. Apt. 4, Madison, WI, United States of America, haoz@cae.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Leyuan Shi, Robert Meyer, Warren D'Souza<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We provide a framework for integrating two stages of Radiation Treatment Planning (RTP): Beam Angle Selection (BAS) and Dose Optimization (DO). Alternative BAS and DO algorithms or commercial RTP software and clinical experience can be embedded within the framework. Automated BAS and improved dose distribution are achieved within the framework. Computational efficiency is achieved by utilizing High-Throughput Computing (HTC) via the Condor system.
