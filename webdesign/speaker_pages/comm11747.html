Title: Dynamic Traffic Assignment for Operations Planning<br>Author: Andy Chow, Postdoc Scholar, California PATH, 1357 S. 46th Street, Richmond Field Station, Bldg 452, Richmond, CA, 94804, United States of America, ahfchow@path.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuegang (Jeff) Ban<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper investigates the development and application of dynamic traffic assignment for real world traffic operations planning. We particularly highlight some theoretical features and limitations of DTA models (e.g. existence of user equilibrium, path-based and link-based formulations, and approximation schemes for solving large-scale problems) and the ways we tackle the challenges. The findings can also support further analysis and model development in this area.
