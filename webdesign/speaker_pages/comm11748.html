Title: Designing Clinical Trials for Cancer: An Analytics Approach<br>Author: Stephen Relyea, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Bldg. E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, srelyea@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Silberholz, Dimitris Bertsimas, Allison O'Hair<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a data-driven approach for designing new clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy treatments. Our approach combines (i) text-mining to develop a database of existing trial results, (ii) statistical modeling to predict outcomes of new drug combinations, and (iii) optimization models to select novel treatments that strike a balance between maximizing patient outcomes (exploitation) and learning new things about treatments that may be useful in the future (exploration).
