Title: Valuation of Electricity Generation Facilities: Optimal Exercise Boundaries Approach<br>Author: Valeriy Ryabchenko, PhD Student, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, valeriy@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stan Uryasev<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The paper presents an optimization approach to valuation of electricity generation assets. We build a LP model to find the optimal operation boundaries for an electricity generation plant. We consider different operational constraints: start-up and shut-down costs, ramp-up time, output dependent operating heat rate. The model is furnished with a set of monotonicity constraints on decision variables. We test the model with historical and simulated sample paths.
