Title: A New Sequential Sampling Scheme for Reliability-based Design Optimization<br>Author: Pingfeng Wang, Assistant Professor, Wichita State University, WIchita, KS, United States of America, Pingfeng.Wang@wichita.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zequn Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This talk presents a new sequential sampling approach for efficient simulation-based design for reliability. A cumulative confidence level (CCL) is defined to quantify the accuracy of reliability estimation using Kriging models and a new sequential sampling scheme is then developed to sequentially enroll new design samples to update the Kriging models based on the maximum improvement of the defined CCL measure. Multiple case studies are used to show the efficacy of the methodology.
