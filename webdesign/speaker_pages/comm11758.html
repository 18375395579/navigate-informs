Title: Adaptive Operation Decisions for Smart Building Cluster<br>Author: Mengqi Hu, Assistant Professor, Mississippi State University, PO Box 9542, 260 McCain Hall, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, United States of America, mhu@ise.msstate.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An adaptive decision framework is developed to derive operation decisions for the smart building cluster by considering system dynamic, uncertainties in the building and environment. The adaptive decision framework has three stages: decisions generation, execution, and calibration. The result demonstrates that the framework is able to derive adaptive operation decisions for the building cluster which could make buildings quickly respond to the dynamic environment, and achieve more cost savings.
