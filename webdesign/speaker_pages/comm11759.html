Moitra, Professor, IIM Calcutta, Diamond Harbour Road, Joka, Kolkata, WB, 700104, India, sdmoitra@hotmail.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes a model that would help an organization achieve an optimal network security. The model considers the patterns of Internet crimes against organizations and postulates a relationship between security measures and incidence of cyber attacks. The model balances the reduction in the expected damage caused to the organization’s systems with the cost of the network security. An illustrative example is provided. The model can be implemented quite easily by organizations.</br>
