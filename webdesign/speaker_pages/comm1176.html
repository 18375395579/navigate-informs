<br>Title: Policy Evaluation Algorithms Using Function Approximations</br><br>Author: Angelia Nedich, Assistant Professor, University of iIllinois at Urbana Champaign, 104 S Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, angelia@uiuc.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider policy evaluation algorithms for infinite horizon dynamic programming problems with discounted cost. The focus is on discrete time dynamic systems with a large number of states. We discuss methods for policy evaluation that use temporal diffrences and function approximations. The methods update parameters of the function approximation on-line incrementally   based on observations of system states from an infinite trajectory.</br>
