Title: Multi-period Planning for Electric-car Charging Station Locations: A Case of Korean Expressways<br>Author: Sung Chung, New Mexico Tech, 801 Leroy Place, Socorro, 87801, United States of America, schung@nmt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Changhyun Kwon<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a multi-period planning problem that extends a flow-refueling location model. We develop a case study based on the real traffic flow data of the Korean Expressway network in 2011, for which it is highly desirable to build charging stations within the network. We discuss performances of single-period and multi-period models.
