<br>Title: A Minimum Risk Equitable Hazardous Materials Flow Model</br><br>Author: Ashrafur Rahman, University of Connecticut, 261 Glenbrook Road, Unit 3037, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, arahman@engr.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Lownes</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We formulate a hazardous materials flow model to minimize the risk over the entire network for multiple origin-destinations. A new approach was used to define link risk using a decay function, travel time, traffic volume, and population. To consider risk equity, we include a risk threshold to limit the risk on each link.</br>
