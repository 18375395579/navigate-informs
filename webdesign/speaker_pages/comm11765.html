Title: Data Mining Meta-optimization for Biomechanics Data Analysis<br>Author: Kaizhi Tang, tangkz@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Xiong Liu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We address the problem of meta-optimization of finding an optimal data mining model which has the best performance for a given dataset. We have applied data mining meta-optimization in analyzing biomechanics data. The results show that meta-optimization can significantly improve the performance of data mining algorithms.
