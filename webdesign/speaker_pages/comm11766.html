Title: Operations Research and Network Science through Minerva's Social Science Lens<br>Author: Kathryn Coronges, United States Military Academy, Department of Behavioral Sciences, West Point, United States of America, kathryn.coronges@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Arney<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Today's military is based on information processing for decision making.  No longer are operations always won by the most powerful, but rather victory often goes to the information dominant, culturally-aware, net-centric force.  Minerva seeks to understand the cultural, social, and behavioral dynamics that shape military operations.  Our Minerva framework takes an interdisciplinary approach that require operations research analysis, network modeling, and social science perspectives.
