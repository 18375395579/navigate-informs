Title: Robust Dependence Modeling for High-dimensional Covariance Matrices<br>Author: Zhe (David) Zhu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, zhe.zhu@sloan.mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Roy Welsch<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Estimating dispersion matrices is a fundamental step for many applications, but classical sample covariance estimates are very sensitive to outliers. We propose a new robust covariance estimator using the regular vine structure and robust partial correlation estimators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such estimator in the active asset allocation application.
