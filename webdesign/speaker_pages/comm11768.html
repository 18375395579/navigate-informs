<br>Title: A Dynamic Network Equilibrium Model in Face of Uncertain Capacities</br><br>Author: ManWo Ng, Graduate Research Assistant, Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering / The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, C1761, ECJ 6.208, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, mwng@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In previous studies, it has been shown that travelers select their paths not only based on an estimated deterministic travel time, but also based on travel time reliability. In this paper we extend the cell transmission model-based dynamic route choice model to account for travel time reliability caused by supply variations. Numerical examples are presented and discussed.</br>
