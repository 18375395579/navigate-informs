Title: Pumping Scheduling in Object Oriented Simulation of Hydroelectric Power Systems<br>Author: Jesús M. Latorre, Universidad Pontificia Comillas, Alberto Aguilera 23, Madrid, 28015, Spain, Jesus.Latorre@iit.icai.upcomillas.es<br>Coauthor(s): Andres Ramos, Santiago Cerisola<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The simulation model, based on the OOP paradigm, uses a fixed time step of one day, and adapts the management decisions obtained from a longer scope model to a daily use. It can model generating and pumping units and canals. We propose a three pass algorithm in order to reduce spillages to a minimum. This algorithm determines the hydro production of every reservoir including pumping scheduling decisions, to reach this objective. Numerical results from a real basin from Spain are presented.
