<br>Title: Long Term Capacity Equilibria under Risk: A Stochastic LP Approach Extending MARKAL</br><br>Author: Daniel Ralph, University of Cambridge Judge Business School, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, d.ralph@jbs.cam.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yves Smeers</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Linear Programming, LP, is standard for modelling long term capacity equilibria, eg, MARKAL for electricity capacity, given Perfect Competition, PC. Uncertainty can be handled via expectations, ie, stochastic LP.  We extend this to give an economic market interpretation of system capacity planning under risk aversion (Coherent Risk Measures). Namely, stochastic LP can be used to model capacity equilibria under risk assuming PC and financial securities are traded in a Complete Risk Market.</br>
