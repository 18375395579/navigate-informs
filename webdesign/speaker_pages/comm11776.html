Title: Emergency Disruptions and Patient Overflow: A Simulation Study<br>Author: Yann Ferrand, University of Cincinnati, Department of QAOM, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, United States of America, ferrany@email.uc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mike Magazine, Uday Rao<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In a hospital that serves elective and emergency patients, we seek to answer whether it is better to deal with emergency overflows by dedicating rooms based on type of patient, or by allowing flexibility through room sharing between all patients. We use discrete event simulation to evaluate the performance of several allocation policies under various input conditions, such as arrival patterns and processing time variance, by measuring patient wait time, doctor utilization and staff overtime.
