Title: Use of DEA Cross-efficiency Evaluation in Portfolio Selection<br>Author: Sungmook Lim, Associate Professor, Korea University, Jochiwon-eup, Yeongi-gun, Chungnam, 339700, Korea, Republic of, sungmook@korea.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Joe Zhu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a novel use of DEA cross-efficiency evaluation in portfolio selection. In addition to average cross-efficiency scores, we suggest to examine the variations of cross-efficiencies, and to incorporate the two statistics of cross-efficiencies into the mean-variance formulation of portfolio selection. Two benefits can be attained by this approach; selection of robust portfolios and alleviation of the so-called “ganging together?phenomenon of DEA cross-efficiency evaluation.
