Title: Ordinal Regression Model for Forecasting Enroute Controller Requirements<br>Author: Shin-Lai Tien, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Maryland, Dept. of Civil & Environmental Engr., College Park, MD, 20742, United States, alextien@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Schonfeld<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A model for forecasting enroute controller requirements in response to future flight demand is developed for incorporation into the FAA's NAS Strategy Simulator. Probabilities of using between 0 and 4 controllers per sector are estimated from the controller work history based on traffic densities and other sector characteristics. The model's results can help in estimating future capacity and evaluating enroute performance.
