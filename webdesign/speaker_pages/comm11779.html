Title: Designing and Valuation of Financial Options on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve<br>Author: Fernando Oliveira, Assistant Professor, ESSEC Business School, Avenue Bernard Hirsch - BP 50105, 95021 - Cergy-Pontoise, France, oliveira@essec.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Frederic Murphy<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We design and evaluate financial options for market-based management of the U.S. government’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). We use a coupled Markovian Decision Process to model a game in which a public maximizes social welfare and a private player is a speculator. We compute the optimal number of options required by the optimal policy. Finally, we analyze the conditions under which the value of such options can be computed and we solve instances of the model using Monte-Carlo simulation.
