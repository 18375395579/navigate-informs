Amongst other methods, the efficiency of port production can potentially be analyzed by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) or by the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) model. This paper aims to evaluate the efficiency of major North American ports using DEA and FDH models.  The results show that the above two techniques lead to different conclusions.</br>
