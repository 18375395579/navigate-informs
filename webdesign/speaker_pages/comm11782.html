Title: Flow Modeling and Prediction of Heterogeneous Patients Using Semi-Markov Mixture Clustering<br>Author: Chitta Ranjan, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, nk.chitta.ranjan@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kamran Paynabar, Jonathan Helm<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Planning methods in hospitals rely on accurate estimation of patient flow for census predictions. We propose a hybrid clustering-classification prediction model for better estimation of patient flow. Semi-Markov model-based clustering is developed to cluster a heterogeneous mix of patients into homogeneous groups of patients with similar flow patterns. The clustering model is then linked with a classifier to predict the patient flow based on patient attributes.
