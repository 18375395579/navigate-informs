Title: An Agent-based Data Mining Meta-optimization Engine<br>Author: Xiong Liu, xliu@i-a-i.com<br>Coauthor(s): Kaizhi Tang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Data mining meta-optimization usually involves evaluating a series of configurations for many algorithms. Since each configuration can be evaluated independently, the data mining meta-optimization problem can be solved using distributed computing. We developed an agent-based, distributed computation engine to power the meta-optimization. This engine can significantly reduce computational time.
