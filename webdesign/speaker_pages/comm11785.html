Title: Clinical Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness of Antiretroviral Therapy in Resource-Poor Settings<br>Author: Heather Hsu, Research Assistant, Section of Decision Science and Clinical Systems Modeling, University of Pittsburgh, 200 Meyran Avenue, 2nd Floor, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, hsuhe@upmc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rochelle Walensky, Jon Kaplan, Kenneth Freedberg, Milton Weinstein, Sue Goldie, Yazdan Yazdanpanah, Elena Losina, Xavier Anglaret, April Kimmel, Charles Holmes<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: As antiretroviral therapy (ART) is increasingly utilized in resource-limited settings, questions remain regarding treatment timing and use of diagnostic tests to guide clinical decisions.  Our aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ART for HIV-infected adults in Côte d’Ivoire and similar settings. We present a state-transition simulation model of HIV, incorporating CD4 and HIV RNA as predictors of disease progression, to project long-term clinical, cost, and cost-effectiveness outcomes.
