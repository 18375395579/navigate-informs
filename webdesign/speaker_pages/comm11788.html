<br>Title: The Simulation Start-up Problem: Performance Comparison of Recent Solution Procedures</br><br>Author: James Wilson, Professor, Edward P. Fitts Department of Industrial Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695-7906, United States of America, jwilson@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anup Mokashi, Emily Lada</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We summarize the results of a comprehensive experimental performance comparison of some recent procedures for solving the simulation start-up problem, including the methods incorporated in MSER-5, N-Skart, WASSP, and SBatch.  Substantial differences in performance are observed, especially in comparisons of MSER-5 with  the latter three procedures.</br>
