Title: Long Term Optimization of the Production Chain in Open-pit and Underground Copper Mines<br>Author: Felipe Caro, Assistant Professor, University of California, Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management, Westwood, CA, 90095, United States, fcaro@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jaime Catalan, Rafael Epstein, Marcel Goic, Pablo Santibanez, Andres Weintraub<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Based on our experience in modeling Chilean open pit and underground copper mines, we discuss the importance of modeling in an integrated way the production chain from the initial extraction to the delivery of final products. In particular, we show the impact of a model used to optimize long term mining plans that has been implemented at Codelco, Chile.
