Title: A Risk Mitigation Model Concerning Hazardous Materials and Terrorist Threat<br>Author: Justin Yates, Ph.D Candidate, SUNY at Buffalo, Dept. of Industrial and Systems Eng, 418 Lawrence D. Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260-2050, United States, jtyates@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Karwan, Rajan Batta, Irene Casas<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Models reducing the capability of attackers to use hazardous materials (hazmat) as a terrorist weapon often accept assumptions which limit their applicability.  Using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and optimization software, this research incorporates combinatorial and stochastic modeling with spatial referencing and representation tools to develop a more robust OR model for mitigating risk in a geographic area due to the potential, intentional use of hazmat as a weapon of destruction.
