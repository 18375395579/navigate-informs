<br>Title: A Monte Carlo Approach to Information Recovery</br><br>Author: Jun Yang, Prof., Duke University, Durham, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, junyang@cs-duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Haixun Wang, Junyi Xie, Yuguo Chen, Philip S. Yu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed a surge of interest in noisy and  incomplete data. An approach for recovering information from such  data should incorporate prior knowledge, even if it has complex forms  that do not admit closed-form solutions. Moreover, the approach  should quantify uncertainties and correlations in the recovered  data.  We present such an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling, and  illustrate it in the contexts of noisy sensor data and  privacy-preserving data publishing.</br>
