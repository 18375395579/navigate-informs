An approach for recovering information from such  data should incorporate prior knowledge, even if it has complex forms  that do not admit closed-form solutions. Moreover, the approach  should quantify uncertainties and correlations in the recovered  data.  We present such an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling, and  illustrate it in the contexts of noisy sensor data and  privacy-preserving data publishing.
