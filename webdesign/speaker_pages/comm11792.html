<br>Title: Simulation Cloning with Induced Negative Correlation</br><br>Author: Judy Lee, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, jlee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir, Richard Fujimoto</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Simulation cloning expedites simulation experiments by sharing computational results among different sample paths. We study the use of simulation cloning for estimating transient performance measures. We consider basic cloning with one or more decision points. Also, we induce negative correlation to reduce variance. When simulating a replication is costly and variability is larger in the replicated part, cloning can significantly improve the efficiency of the simulation.</br>
