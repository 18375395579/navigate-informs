Title: The Value of Temporal Data for Learning Networks of Influence Faster<br>Author: Spyros Zoumpoulis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, szoumpou@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Munther Dahleh, John N. Tsitsiklis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We assess the value of temporal data for learning local influence relations between networked entities from data on outcomes both theoretically and practically. Our theoretical guarantees characterize the sufficient and necessary scaling of samples required for correct learning under different data modes. Experiments on both synthetic and real data quantify the improvement in learning due to richer temporal data, and show that our methodology recovers the underlying network well.
