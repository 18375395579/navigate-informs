Title: Tutorial:  Building a Stochastic Simulation from Scratch<br>Author: H. Ric Blacksten, Senior Analyst, ANSER/Homeland Security Institute, 2900 S.

From scratch means without special-purpose simulation add-ins or template simulations.   We show how to construct a real time simulation, sampling from Bernoulli, Poisson,  Gaussian and general piecewise-linear user-input distributions.  We show that, for some problems, simpler expected value models give incorrect results.
