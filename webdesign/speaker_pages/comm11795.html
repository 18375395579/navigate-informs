The fraction may be anywhere between 0 and 1 and rules of thumb such as Np>5 may not be helpful. We propose a Cusum chart where the nominal false alarm rate is achieved, and the parameters are calculated easily (without tables, simulation, or Markov Chain analysis). The new method also has a superior sensitivity compared with other easily designed existing methods.</br>
