Title: Quantification of Surgical Team Communication Patterns Related to HRO Principles<br>Author: Amanda Baty, Texas Tech University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Box 43061, Lubbock, TX, 79409, United States of America, amanda.baty@ttu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Matis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This research establishes a set of high reliability organization (HRO) principles and recurrence metrics which are significant in predicting the performance of surgical teams based on their communication patterns, where performance is defined by the time to respond to a shock. Through a simulation study communication patterns of surgical procedures are analyzed. Linear regression is conducted to determine significant HRO and recurrence metrics in predicting performance of surgical teams.
