Title: The Value of Hedging<br>Author: Thomas Seyller, Ph.D Candidate, Stanford University, Dept. of Management Science & Engineerin, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, tseyller@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We will present a decision analysis approach to hedging. We will first use indifferent buying and selling prices to define the value of hedging that an uncertain deal provides with respect to the decision maker’s existing portfolio; we will then examine some of the fundamental properties of the value of hedging and show how probabilistic dependence and risk attitude affect it. Throughout the presentation, we will refer to concrete examples to illustrate the approach.
