In recent years, many new designs have been created to address the large number of factors and complex response surfaces that often arise in simulation studies.  These include procedures capable of handling discrete-valued or qualitative factors.  We describe some of these advances, and summarize the results of utilizing large-scale designed experiments for several defense simulation studies.</br>
