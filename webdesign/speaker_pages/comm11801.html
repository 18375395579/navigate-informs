First, a multi-attribute regression model based on a discrete-event simulation is developed to model the impact of PHEV demand on the service level of charging stations. Second, a multi-objective, mixed-integer, non-linear model is formulated to find the location, number of chargers and capacity of charging stations, and the allocation of electricity between charging stations and demand nodes.</br>
