Title: Robust Optimization for Large-scale, Network-based Resource Allocation Problems<br>Author: Lavanya Marla, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, United States, lavanya@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Barnhart<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider large-scale, network-based resource allocation problems under uncertainty. By proactively modeling data uncertainty, we generate plans which are robust operationally. We propose in this work a decomposition modeling and algorithmic framework that improves solution tractability for deterministic problems and, in addition, models uncertainty. As proof-of-concept, we apply our approach to an airline scheduling problem and evaluate its performance using data from a large carrier.
