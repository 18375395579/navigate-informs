Title: Contact Tracing for Chronic Viral Diseases<br>Author: Benjamin Armbruster, IEMS, Northwestern, Evanston, IL, United States of America, armbrusterb@fastmail.fm<br>Coauthor(s): Margaret Brandeau<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a compartmental model of a chronic infectious disease to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of different levels of screening and contact tracing.  We determine the optimal level of control to identify infected individuals for treatment (screening plus contact tracing), and we determine the optimal mix of screening and contact tracing for any level of control.  We apply our model to an example of Hepatitis B virus.
