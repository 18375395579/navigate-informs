<br>Title: Air-travel Passenger Time-of-day and Day-of-week Preferences</br><br>Author: Gregory Coldren, President, Coldren Choice Consulting Ltd., 123 South Adams St., Rockville, MD, 20850, United States of America, gregorycoldren@yahoo.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This talk estimates air-travel itinerary share models focusing on passenger time-of-day and day-of-week preferences. Models using continuous time-of-day utility curves gotten from trigonometric functions are shown to be superior to models using time period constants. The models differentiate between outbound vs. inbound passengers and different days of the week. Finally, advanced GEV models are estimated allowing for increased inter-itinerary competition among time periods and carriers.</br>
