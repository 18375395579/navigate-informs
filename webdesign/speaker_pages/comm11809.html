Title: Exporting Models as POAMS Web Services<br>Author: Victor Foulk, Systems and Industrial Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, vfoulk@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Leo Lopes<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The POAMS system contains some interface libraries designed to export a Mathematical Model, as opposed to an Instance, as a Web Service. In this talk, we will illustrate two aspects of POAMS web services: the benefits this approach affords to users of mathematical programming models; and the steps model creators must take to enable their models to be exported as Web Services.
