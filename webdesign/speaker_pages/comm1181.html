<br>Title: Discrete Combat Models: Investigating the Solutions to Discrete Forms of Lanchester's Combat Models</br><br>Author: William Fox, Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Department of Defense Analysis, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, wpfox@nps.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine a few historic battles by investigating the use of Lanchester's equation in a discrete version. We use discrete dynamical systems to model these conflicts and gain insights into methods of “directed fire?conflicts. We employ numerical and graphical solutions to be analyzed and that do not require the mathematical rigor of differential equations. We further investigate the analytical form of the “direct fire?solutions to be used in modeling efforts.</br>
