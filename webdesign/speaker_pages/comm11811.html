<br>Title: Sequential Value Function Approximations for Real-world Dynamic Programming</br><br>Author: Huiyuan Fan, University of Texas at Arlington, Dept. of Ind. & Manuf. Sys. Eng., Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, hyfan@uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victoria Chen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A sequential method for future value function approximations of dynamic programming (DP) is presented based on combining the methods of sequential design of computer experiment and the theory of consistency for a class of nonparametric estimators. Multilayer feed-forward neural networks are taken as the nonparametric models and low discrepancy sequences are used for sequentially sampling the training data. The new method is validated with a nine-dimensional inventory forecasting problem.</br>
