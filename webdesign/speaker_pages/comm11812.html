The World Health Organization recommends which strains of influenza to include in each year’s vaccine based on surveillance data and epidemiological analysis. We propose a class of multi–stage stochastic mixed-integer programming models addressing the optimal design of the annual flu shot in terms of timing and composition.</br>
