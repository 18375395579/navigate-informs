The flows in the national airspace system are not sufficient to warrant a direct interpretation as fluid flow.  Instead, we explore the use of fluid approximations by considering aircraft as divisible objects whose flow in the system carries stochastic implications.  We test these ideas on the DELAYS queuing model and a diffusion model.</br>
