<br>Title: The Demand for Resource Allocation Technologies: The Case of Hospital Surgical Management Software</br><br>Author: Eli Snir, Asst. Professor, Southern Methodist University, Cox School of Business, PO Box 750333, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States of America, esnir@cox.smu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey McCullough</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the potential for health IT to increase healthcare resource allocation efficiency. In particular, we model hospital’s surgical scheduling software demand. We develop a theoretical software demand. We test this model using IT investment and surgical service data from about 3000 hospitals. Using revealed preference techniques, we find that scheduling software demand is increasing in service scope and is used to enhance surgical service efficiency.</br>
