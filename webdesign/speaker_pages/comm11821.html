Title: Optimizing Downstream Biomanufacturing Operations under Quality Constraints and Batch Failures<br>Author: Tugce Martagan, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, martagan@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Krishnamurthy<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a continuous state, discrete time Markov Decision Process model to optimize downstream purification processes in a biomanufacturing facility. The model combines the physical characteristics of chromatography (column dimensions, resin binding capabilities) along with process reliability (yields, failures, and constraints on purity levels) to determine optimal policies.
