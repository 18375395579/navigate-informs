Title: Interaction-driven Physical Model Selection for SA-MOCVD Synthesis Process of Nanowires<br>Author: Lijuan Xu, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Ave, GER 236, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, lijuanxu@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Qiang Huang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Numbers of physical models are proposed to describe the SA-MOCVD synthesis of nanowires without definite conclusion. In this paper, we incorporate interaction modeling to capture the local variability and develop an interaction-driven technique to select physical models to achieve better understanding of the process.
