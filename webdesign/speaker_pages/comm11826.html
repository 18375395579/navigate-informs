Title: Optimal Replacement Models for a Wind Turbine Component<br>Author: John Flory, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1048 Benedum Hall, 3700 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, jhnflory@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Kharoufeh<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present two partially-observed Markov decision process (POMDP) models for replacing a wind-turbine component based on observability of a stochastic operating environment. Component degradation is environment-driven and continuous. The POMDP models are solved using belief-projection, and numerical experiments suggest the existence of optimal threshold-type policies with respect to cumulative degradation.
