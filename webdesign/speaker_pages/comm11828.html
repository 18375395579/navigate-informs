Title: Evacuating Patients based on Prioritization Modeling<br>Author: Kevin Taaffe, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, 110 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, taaffe@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ashley Childers<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the event of an emergency evacuation of a healthcare facility, the typical planning assumption is that all patients will be evacuated.  With limited resources, there may not be time to transfer all patients.  Based on selected objectives, we suggest a decision framework for patient evacuation based on priority modeling.
