<br>Title: Evacuating Patients based on Prioritization Modeling</br><br>Author: Kevin Taaffe, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, 110 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, taaffe@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ashley Childers</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In the event of an emergency evacuation of a healthcare facility, the typical planning assumption is that all patients will be evacuated.
