We built a simulation model of the Emergency Department, which captures all relevant treatment processes, complicated arrival rates and adjustable staff deployment. To tackle a challenge of data incompleteness, we estimated required parameters in our model with the help of meta-heuristics. We will also present some insights and suggestions for operational improvements by using our model.</br>
