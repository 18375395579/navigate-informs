Title: Effects of Warpage on Fatigue Reliability of Solder Bumps: Experimental and Analytical Studies<br>Author: Ying Hung, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Dr. NW, Altanta, GA, yhung@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): C. F. Jeff Wu, Wei Tan, Charles Ume<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Out-of-plane displacement has been a major thermomechanical reliability concern for electronic packages. In this research, the effect of initial PWB warpage on the low cycle thermal fatigue reliability of the solder bumps was evaluated from experimental thermal cycling tests and finite element results. Kriging model was used to predict solder bump fatigue life based on the initial PWB warpage, package locations, and solder bump materials.
