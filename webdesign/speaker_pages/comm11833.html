<br>Title: Mathematical Programming Approaches to Reduce Gene Signature Size</br><br>Author: Glenn Fung, Senior Scientist, Siemens Medical Solutions, 51 Valley Stream Parkway, Malvern, PA, 19355, United States, glenn.fung@siemens.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Recent technologies to capture gene expression levels from a DNA microarray have made possible to find new gene expression signatures with prognostic and diagnostic significance but that depend on thousands of genes. This may lead to poor signature generalization capabilities on unseen data. We explore the use of several mathematical-programming-based techniques to reduce the gene signature sizes while maintaining the signature prognostic and diagnostic significance.</br>
