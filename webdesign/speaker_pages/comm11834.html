Title: Imaging Based Treatment Plan Optimization for Glioblastoma<br>Author: Jan Unkelbach, Massachusetts General Hospital, 30 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, United States of America, junkelbach@partners.org<br>Coauthor(s): Bjoern Menze, Ender Konukoglu, Helen Shih<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Treatment planning for radiotherapy consists of two problems: 1) determining external beam parameters to realize a desired dose distribution, and 2) determining the desired dose distribution from clinical and biological data including dose-response relations, imaging data, or histology. Quantitative approaches to integrate these sources of data involve both mathematical modeling approaches a well as statistical machine learning methods. This approach is discussed for treatments of gliomas.
