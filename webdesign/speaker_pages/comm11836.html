Title: Detecting Anomalous Patterns in Multivariate Temporal Data<br>Author: Weng-Keen Wong, Assistant Professor, Oregon State University, 1148 Kelley Engineering Center, Corvallis, OR, 97330, United States, wong@eecs.oregonstate.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A common task in many domains involves the monitoring of routinely collected data for anomalous patterns.  This task is prevalent in surveillance and also in the analysis of scientific data.  We present algorithms for detecting anomalous patterns in multivariate, categorical time series.  These algorithms have primarily been applied to the area of disease surveillance but they are general enough to address similar problems in other domains.
