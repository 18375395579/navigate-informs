<br>Title: A Data-integrated Nurse-patient Assignment Simulation: Development and Validation</br><br>Author: Durai Sundaramoorthi, The University of Texas at Arlington, Campus Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019-0017, United States, dxs7400@omega.uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger, Victoria Chen, Seoung Bum Kim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research develops and validates a novel data-integrated simulation to evaluate nurse-patient assignments (SIMNA) based on a real data set provided by Baylor Regional Medical Center (Baylor) in Grapevine, Texas. Data mining methods were utilized to extract important knowledge from the data for the simulation. A simulation-based optimization technique was developed to assign the incoming patient during a given shift.</br>
