However, the normal system used by soccer leagues is to award three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. From the standpoint of gaining league points, a soccer game can be modeled as a non-zero-sum game. Here, we propose a game theoretic approach to modeling tactical changes of formation. We show a solution of the game with the expected number of league points and discuss a merit of cooperation between two teams, using real data of the J League.
