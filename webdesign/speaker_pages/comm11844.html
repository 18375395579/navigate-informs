<br>Title: A Mixed Integer Programming Model and Analysis of Biofuel Production</br><br>Author: Halil Ibrahim Cobuloglu, Graduate Research Assistant, Wichita State University, 1845 N Fairmount, Office 208A, Ind. & Manuf. Engineering Department, Wichita, KS, 67260, United States of America, hicobuloglu@wichita.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Esra Buyuktahtakin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we propose a multi-objective mixed integer programming model for biofuel production using switchgrass in US. This mathematical model maximizes the yield from switchgrass during its expected life span while considering its potential economical and environmental impacts under various production and harvesting scenarios.</br>
