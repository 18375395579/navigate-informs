Title: Modeling Information Sharing and Cooperation in Multi-agent Systems<br>Author: David Jeffcoat, Senior Research Engineer, AFRL/MNGN, 101 W.

Our focus is on a special form of cooperation, namely information sharing.  The objective is to develop mathematical models for cooperation via information sharing in complex large-scale systems.  The approach is based on the techniques of discrete-state, continuous-time Markov chain models.  The primary application context is the search for targets in a combat scenario.
