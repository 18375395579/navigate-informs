<br>Title: Dynamic Constraint Formulation for Supply Chain Disruptions</br><br>Author: Julie Drzymalski, PhD Candidate, Lehigh University, Mohler Laboratory, 200 W. Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, jud204@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Odrey</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A hierarchical Petri net (PN) approach is taken to model a multi-echelon Supply Chain (SC) using a modular approach for the process steps and performance measures. Our modeling is extracted from the SCOR 8.0 model. Strategic and operational policies are considered dynamic. In response to a disruption, these policies are optimized and enforced on the system as dynamic constraints. These constraints, combined with the place invariants of the PN, yield a supervisory net for control of the SC.</br>
