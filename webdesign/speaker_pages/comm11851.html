Title: Selfish Drug Allocation for Containing an International Influenza Pandemic<br>Author: Francis de Vericourt, Professor, European School of Management and Technology, devericourt@esmt.org<br>Coauthor(s): Peng Sun<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Recent epidemiological studies suggest the prophylactic use of antiviral drugs or imperfect vaccines to slow down an influenza epidemic, which gives rise to a game where each country allocates its stockpile in order to protect its own population. We develop a Reed-Frost model for an epidemic at its onset, and show that the underlying game is supermodular and a unique Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium exists. We also provide results for the optimal centralized solution.
