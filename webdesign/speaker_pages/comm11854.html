Title: Development of a Supply Chain Design Optimization Tool Using Xpress-Mosel and GLPK<br>Author: Ricki Ingalls, Associate Professor, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, ricki.ingalls@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chinnatat Methapatara, Peerapol Sittivijan, Mario Cornejo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper addresses an on-going effort of developing a supply chain modeling tool that combines optimization and simulation. Two different versions of the optimization module are developed, one using Xpress-Mosel and the other one using the open source software GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit). This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using a commercial solver such as Xpress-Mosel and an open source solver such as GLPK.  It also discusses modeling and execution issues.
