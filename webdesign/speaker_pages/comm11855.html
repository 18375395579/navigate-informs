<br>Title: Discrete Event Simulation Analysis of a Reservation-based Car Sharing System with One-way Journeys</br><br>Author: Matthew Petering, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, 3200 North Cramer St., EMS E367, Milwaukee, WI, 53211, United States of America, mattpete@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Liping Li</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We use a discrete event simulation model to analyze the performance of a reservation-based car sharing system that allows one-way journeys.  The model appears to be unique in the literature in that it (1) explicitly models the state of the online reservation system in continuous time; (2) provides a full animation of car pick-ups, journeys, and drop-offs; and (3) explicitly includes the rental of extra parking time at a car’s pick-up and drop-off location in the car reservation process.</br>
