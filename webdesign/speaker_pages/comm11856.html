Lee</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a large number of innovations in the field of bioinformatics, as exemplified by the Human Genome Project. Consequently, the rapid increase in the amount of sequence data requires efficient algorithms to analyze and make important discoveries in this exciting field. The talk will present Integer Programming models to address this need. Computational results on large-scale sequence analysis problems will be provided to demonstrate the robustness of proposed methodology.</br>
