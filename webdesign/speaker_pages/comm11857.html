Title: A Birth Death Model for the Performance of an EMS System with Re-positioning<br>Author: Ramon Alanis, University of Alberta, School of Business, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G2R6, Canada, ramon.alanis@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Bora Kolfal, Armann Ingolfsson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a Markovian Birth and Death model for the behavior of an EMS system, and how it can be used to estimate its expected performance. We demonstrate how it can be used to estimate the effects of changes in repositioning policies, and validate the model with field data.
