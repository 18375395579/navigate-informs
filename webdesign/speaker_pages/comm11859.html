<br>Title: Assessing Project Management Competences in the Globalized Environments</br><br>Author: Constanta-N Bodea, Professor, Academy of Economic Studies, 6, Piata Romana Street, Bucharest, Ro, 010374, Romania, bodea@pm.org.ro</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cristina Mihaila, Sergiu Jecan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The paper presents a competence assessment approach based on the semantic networks. The approach is implemented in a web based learning environment capable of building and conducting a complete and personalized training cycle, from the definition of the learning objectives to the assessment of the learning results for each learner. The testing and evaluation facilities of the system are based on the ontological approach. The educational ontology is mapped on a semantic network. Further, the semantic network is projected into a concept space graph. The semantic computability of the concept space graph is used for test design.</br>
