Title: The Development of a Spatially and Temporally Scalable Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model<br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, PO Box 210072, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, chiu@utep.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jorge A. Villalobos, Pitu Mirchandani<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present the theoretical development and implementation of a spatially and temporally scalable DTA (STS-DTA) model.  The STS-DTA model utilizes a cluster-computing methodology that enables flexible scaling of the network.  The Anisotropic Mesoscopic Simulation (AMS) model provides temporal scalability in traffic simulation resolution. Model semantics and research issues are discussed.
