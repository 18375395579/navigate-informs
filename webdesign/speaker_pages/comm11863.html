<br>Title: Product Assortment Decisions for a Network of Retail Stores using Data Mining with Optimization</br><br>Author: Fidan Boylu, University of Connecticut, One University Pl, Stamford, CT, 07020, United States of America, fidan.boylu@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a model for product assortment optimization for a network of retail stores operating in various locations. We combine local information captured from each retail store and deploy a global frequent itemset analysis based on association rule mining. We solve a network optimization model to find which products to include in a store’s assortment and which stores to ship from. We use the transactional level data from a leading plastics manufacturer and retailer in the United States.</br>
