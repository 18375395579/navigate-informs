<br>Title: Options Framework for Strategic Investments with Knightian Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Bex Thomas, Operations Researcher, GE Global Research, 1 Research Circle, Niskayuna, NY, 12309, bex.thomas@ge.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Strategic investments are difficult to analyze based on standard approaches such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Net Present Value (NPV). However, such strategic investments determine the firm’s competitive success in a dynamic competitive market place. Usually such strategic options are high value, high risk technological investments. We will discuss a real options based framework to quantify the value of strategic options and investing under risk. We will extend the real options framework to incorporate the distinction between risk and uncertainty as shown by Frank Knight. The effect of Knightian uncertainty is shown to be very different from that of traditional uncertainty in the form of risk. We will apply this concept for strategic investment in a photovoltaic technology.</br>
