<br>Title: Capacity Analysis of Wake Vortex Hazards</br><br>Author: John Shortle, George Mason University, 4400 University Dr., MS 4A6, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States, jshortle@gmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A landing airplane that encounters a wake may roll, resulting in a crash. Separation requirements insure that severe wake encounters do not occur. This talk examines potential capacity benefits that can be achieved by reducing separation constraints during periods when crosswinds exist to blow the wakes out of the approach path. The probabilistic analysis combines a direct data feed of flight-track data with simulation of wake-evolution models.</br>
