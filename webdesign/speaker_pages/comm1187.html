Title: Using Options Market Data in Asset Liability Management<br>Author: Alan King, IBM, PO Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, kingaj@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk we discuss a framework to calibrate contingent assets and liabilities to options market data.  The calibration framework has a natural interpretation as a utility function, and the output is a risk-neutral measure that can be used to mark the contingent assets and liabilities to market data.  We discuss how this framework can be applied to asset-liability management problems.
