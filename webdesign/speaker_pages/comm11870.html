Fedorka-Cray, Adrienne Dunham, Beth McGlinchey, Mark Huckabee<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Science based risk analysis improves the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service’s ability to combat threats to public health from food-borne illness by allowing the Agency to focus  resources on hazards that pose the greatest risk.  Innovative algorithms enable detection and containment of threat by analysis of multiple streams of microbiological and sub-typing data, as well as data representing other risk factors such as inspection noncompliance, establishment sizes, and types of produced food.
