<br>Title: How Many Doctors Does it Take?</br><br>Author: Les Vertesi, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Dr, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada, les_vertesi@sfu.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The Ministry of Health and BC’s doctors have discovered discrete event simulation and are currently using it to resolve a long-standing contractual dispute about emergency departments.  The model demonstrates some unusual characteristics in that too much detail actually destroys the model and prevents it from achieving its purpose.  The experience provides insight into the more generic question of what makes modeling activity useful to health care providers, and what does not.</br>
