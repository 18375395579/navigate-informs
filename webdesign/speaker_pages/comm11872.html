Title: Issues in Simulation of Process Execution Monitoring and Adjustment Schemes<br>Author: Dr. Russell Barton, Professor, Penn State, Department of Supply Chain and Informati, 406 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, rbarton@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Shu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: SPC methods can be applied to monitor the timeliness and correctness of the movement of physical or virtual entities through a process.  Comparison of process execution statistical monitoring methods with each other, or with traditional process execution management rules, can require sophisticated discrete-event simulation models.  We discuss the practical issues in building and using simulation models to study process execution monitoring schemes.
