Title: Optimal Transportation Fuel Portfolio Design under Uncertain Technology Growth<br>Author: Yuche Chen, University of California, Dept. of Civil and Env. Eng., Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, ychchen@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yueyue Fan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study focuses on designing an optimal portfolio of liquid transportation fuels, subject to resource, environmental, and technological constraints.  Cellulosic ethanol technology growth is treated as the main source of uncertainty and modeled explicitly in a stochastic programming framework.  The model is used to evaluate the least-cost fuel portfolio that complies with the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and the expansion pattern of cellulosic ethanol industry to support the optimal fuel pathway.
