Title: Optimal Resource Allocation for Preparedness and Recovery of Interdependent Systems<br>Author: Cameron MacKenzie, University of Oklahoma, 202 W Boyd St, Norman, OK, United States of America, cmackenzie@ou.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kash Barker<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Investing in infrastructure and industry sectors can lessen the direct impacts of disruptive events, and an input-output model can demonstrate how those direct impacts propagate to other economic sectors. We develop a model where the decision maker allocates resources to prepare for a disruption and to help individual industries recover if the disruption occurs. These models are applied to a case study to analyze the economic impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
