Title: The Balance Optimization Subset Selection (BOSS) Model for Causal Inference<br>Author: Jason Sauppe, University of Illinois, Dept of CS, Urbana, IL, United States of America, sauppe1@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sheldon Jacobson, Edward Sewell, Alexander Nikolaev<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Scientists in many fields rely on observational (non-random) data to estimate the effects of a treatment. To control for potential sources of bias in the estimate, a matching procedure is used. The success of the matching process is assessed using a balance measure. The Balance Optimization Subset Selection model eliminates the matching step and optimizes the balance measure directly. This has the potential to lead to more informed decisions about treatment effectiveness.
