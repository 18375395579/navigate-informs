Title: A Multiattribute Model for Evaluating the Benefit-risk Profiles of Treatment Alternatives<br>Author: James Felli, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Drop Code 1011, Indianapolis, IN, 46236, United States of America, FELLI_JAMES_C@LILLY.COM<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Contrary to the expectations of physicians, patients and regulators, methodologies for making useful risk and benefit tradeoffs continue to be the subject of intense debate.  We have developed a multiattribute model designed to highlight and quantify the relative merits and deficits of treatment alternatives in well-defined and specific contexts, and advocate the usefulness of the model in providing a common, transparent platform for informed and focused discussion among stakeholders.
