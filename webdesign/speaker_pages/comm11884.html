Title: Robust Decision Making using a General Utility Set<br>Author: Sanjay Mehrotra, Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd., Evanston, IL, United States of America, mehrotra@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jian Hu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A robust decision-making framework is built on a general utility set which characterizes a decision maker's risk attitude described by certain boundary and auxiliary conditions. This framework is studied using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) approach.  We shows the asymptomatic convergence and give a mixed-integer reformulation. An application of this framework is illustrated using a portfolio investment decision problem.
