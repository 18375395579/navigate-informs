Title: A Physical-statistical Model for Controlling Density of Zinc Oxide Nanorods<br>Author: Tirthankar Dasgupta, Assistant Professor, Harvard University, 1 Oxford Street, Department of Statistics, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, dasgupta@stat.harvard.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Roshan Josep Vengazhiyil, Benjamin Weintraub<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In order to develop a simple, scalable and cost-effective technique for controlling Zinc nanorod array growth density, layer-by-layer polymer thin films were used in a wet chemical growth process. The objective was to fit a model connecting the thickness of polymer films to the observed density of nanorods. A physical-statistical model fitted with the experimental data helped in better understanding of the underlying growth mechanism.
