Title: A Tractable Analysis of the Transient Behavior of Multi-server Queues<br>Author: Nataly Youssef, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, youssefn@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chaithanya Bandi, Dimitris Bertsimas<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose an analytically tractable approach for studying the transient behavior of multi-server queues with heavy tailed arrival and service processes. We model the queueing primitives via polyhedral uncertainty sets and take a robust perspective. We report computational results that suggest that our new method leads to remarkable closeness to simulation results for a wide range of parameters such as traffic intensity, heavy tail coefficients and number of servers.
