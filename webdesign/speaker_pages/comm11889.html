There are no existing commercial efficient decision tools for developing mitigation strategies on early response, vaccination, prophylaxis, hospitalization, and quarantine actions. A simulation model is presented that mimics propagation of outbreaks under the influence of mitigation strategies using a game-theoretical framework.</br>
