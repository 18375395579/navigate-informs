Title: A Fictitious Play Dynamic Model for the Development of Mitigation Strategies for Pandemic Outbreaks<br>Author: Javier Visbal, Graduate Asistant, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 00, Colombia, javierv@uninorte.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): Carlos Paternina-Arboleda, Diana Ramírez, Edgar Navarro-Lechuga<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Limited inventory of vaccine, antiviral drugs and other health resources pose healthcare delivery challenges for transmittable influenza virus with pandemic potential. There are no existing commercial efficient decision tools for developing mitigation strategies on early response, vaccination, prophylaxis, hospitalization, and quarantine actions. A simulation model is presented that mimics propagation of outbreaks under the influence of mitigation strategies using a game-theoretical framework.
