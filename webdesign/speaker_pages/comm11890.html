Title: Two-stage Group Screening for Computer Experiments<br>Author: Thomas Santner, Professor, The Ohio State University, 1958 Neil Avenue, Cockins Hall 404, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, tjs@stat.osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyejung Moon, Angela Dean<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Experimentation using computer codes to simulate physical processes  is used in many research fields.  Such codes often have many inputs and are cpu intensive.  We propose a two-stage group screening procedure to identifying active inputs.  Stage 1 partitions the inputs into groups and identifies an output for each group; the it identifies active groups using main effect and total sensitivity indices.  Stage 2 identifies active inputs from the individual inputs that comprise the active groups.
