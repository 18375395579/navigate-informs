<br>Title: Structural Estimation of Callers?Delay Sensitivity  in Call Centers</br><br>Author: Seyedmorteza Emadi, PhD student, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, s-emadi@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Baris Ata, Zeynep Aksin, Che-Lin Su</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We model callers' decision making process in call centers as an optimal stopping problem. After each period of waiting a caller decides whether to abandon or to continue to wait. The utility of a caller is modeled as a function of his waiting cost and reward for service. We use random coefficient model to capture the heterogeneity of the callers. Using the data of individual calls made to an Israeli call center, we estimate the cost and reward parameters of the callers.</br>
