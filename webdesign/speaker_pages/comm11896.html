<br>Title: A Robust and Efficient Dynamic Traffic Assignment Solution Procedure for Large-scale Applications</br><br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E 2nd St. Room 206, Department of Civil Eng.and Eng. Mech., Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, chiu@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brenda Bustillos, Eric Nava</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Most simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models are limited spatially and temporally due to computational resource requirements. The concept of rolling epoch is introduced to perform temporally scalable DTA modeling procedure. Model developments and numerical results are presented and discussed in this talk.</br>
