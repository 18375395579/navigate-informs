<br>Title: NET and sim Expression in Drosophila</br><br>Author: Leo Lopes, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1127 E. James E. Rogers Way, Room 111, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, leo@sie.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Konieczka, Parker Antin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present NET: the Network Elucidation Template, a framework for optimization procedures that find the complete structure of a network which is only partially observable. NET combines several methodologies to solve problems whose neighborhood strucutres are complex and whose objective evaluation is expensive. We illustrate NET with an implementation for finding the cell signaling network responsible for producing a line of cells in which the sim gene is expressed in Drosophila embryos.</br>
