A Bushenkov, Marc McDill, Jose G Borges</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper focuses on the use of a decision support system for oak ecosystems?scenario analysis including multiple objectives (e.g.cork production, carbon stocks, protection). The Feasible Goals Method/Interactive Decision Maps (FGM/IDM) technique (applying the Estimation Refinement method) was used to approximate and visualize the Pareto frontier of this multi-criteria optimization problem. Results are discussed for a large-scale application on a cork and holm oak forest in Southern Portugal.</br>
