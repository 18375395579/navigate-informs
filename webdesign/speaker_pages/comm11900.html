GenIQ lets the data define the model- automatically data mines for new variables, variable selection, and the model equation. GenIQ requires no programming, produces models that outdo statistical models, and is for modelers who daringly consider a different model: unsuspected equation, ungainly interpretation, and easy implementation.</br>
