Title: Machine Learning Alternative Model to Statistical Regression Models<br>Author: Bruce Ratner, br@dmstat1.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The GenIQ Model is a machine learning alternative model to the statistical ordinary least squares and logistic regression models. GenIQ lets the data define the model- automatically data mines for new variables, variable selection, and the model equation. GenIQ requires no programming, produces models that outdo statistical models, and is for modelers who daringly consider a different model: unsuspected equation, ungainly interpretation, and easy implementation.
