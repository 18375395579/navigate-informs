Title: Utility of Dependence, Departure from Independence, and Bayesian Reliability<br>Author: Ehsan Soofi, Distinguished Professor, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Lubar School of Business, P.O.

This approach integrates ideas from classic literature on dependence, the Bayesian expected utility in terms of uncertainty reduction, and measuring departure of a dependent model from the independence. We present applications to lifetime models such as Bayesian predictive joint distribution of components of a system and shock models, and Bayesian test of equality of parameters of lifetime models.
