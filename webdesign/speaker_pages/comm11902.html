Title: Revenue Management with Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Julia L. Higle, The Ohio State University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Columbus, OH, United States of America, higle.1@osu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present revenue management models based on stochastic programming constructs. Our model is one that combines capacity-based calculations to obtain price-based policies, while explicitly recognizing the stochastic nature of customer demand in the various market segments.  Data requirements and computational implications will be discussed.
