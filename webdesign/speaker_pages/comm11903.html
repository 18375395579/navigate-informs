The replacement decision is based upon the component's underlying state of degradation.  Information about the degradation state is gathered from real-time sensory signals acquired using condition monitoring techniques.  We formulate the model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and show that a control limit policy (CLP)is optimal for this model.</br>
