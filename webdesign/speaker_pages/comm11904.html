<br>Title: Evidence-Theory Based Parameter Assessment for Homeland Security Risk Analysis</br><br>Author: William McGill, Center for Technology and Systems Management, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, wmcgill@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bilal Ayyub</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper applies the Transferable Belief Model to estimate parameter distributions for probabilistic risk assessments based information from previous analyses, expert opinion, and qualitative assessments (i.e., evidence).  The proposed methodology is demonstrated with an example that estimates the physical vulnerability of a critical infrastructure asset.</br>
