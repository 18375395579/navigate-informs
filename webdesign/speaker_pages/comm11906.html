However, how to place the knots appropriately in B-spline curve fitting remains a difficult problem. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage knots placement method to place knots adapting to the curvature structures of the unknown function. We demonstrated the effectiveness using numerical studies on multiple representative functions.</br>
