Title: Optimizing Emergency Systems with Self-routing Users<br>Author: Jessica Heier, Doctoral Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, jheier@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Ergun, Julie Swann<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study network problems motivated by emergency response scenarios, such as anti-viral distribution during a flu pandemic.  In these problems, decentralized users choose among the facilities opened by a centralized planner.  We quantify the impact of decentralized decision-making on system performance and present price of anarchy results for several cases.  We then extend this framework to the development of facility location models that incorporate decentralized behavior.
