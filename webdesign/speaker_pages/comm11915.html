Title: Nonlinear Modeling of Spiral Wave Formation and Turbulent Patterns in High-dimensional Systems<br>Author: Yun Chen, University of South Florida, 4202 E.

Many previous investigations focused on such space-time patterns on the regular 2D surfaces. This paper presents a dimensionality reduction approach for modeling nonlinear reaction-diffusion mechanisms in high-dimensional systems. This present investigation shows great potentials for characterizing and quantifying space-time dynamics in high-dimensional systems.
