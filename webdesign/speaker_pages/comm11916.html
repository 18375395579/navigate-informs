We developed a finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision process to find the optimal policies for biopsy or short-interval follow-up that maximize patient’s expected quality-adjusted life years. We estimated model’s parameters from clinical data, and performed sensitivity analyses. We provide optimal decision policies based on patient’s demographic factors and mammographic findings.
