Title: Calibration of Probability of Precipitation Forecasts<br>Author: Eric Floehr, President, Intellovations, eric@intellovations.com<br>Coauthor(s): Eric Bickel<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk we will present the results of a large-scale calibration study involving probability of precipitation (POP) forecasts from multiple forecasting services (The Weather Channel, The National Weather Service, and Custom Weather). This is the largest POP calibration study ever published, involving POP forecasts covering nearly 800 locations over a 4-year timeframe. We will compare the sharpness and calibration of forecasts and determine the optimal weighting of each service.
