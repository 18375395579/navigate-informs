Title: Review of Applying Hybrid Approach of Capacity Simulation on a Shared-use Rail Corridor<br>Author: Hamed Pouryousef, Graduate Research Assistant, Michigan Technological University, 824 Dow, CEE Dept, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI, 49931, United States of America, hpouryou@mtu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pasi Lautala<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: There are several simulation tools available for analyzing rail capacity utilization. This research uses two common simulation tools developed in the U.S. and Europe, Rail Traffic Controller (RTC), and RailSys respectively, on a single shared corridor. It evaluates the potential operational benefits of a hybrid approach where output from one software (RTC) is used as input for optimization at another (RailSys) and then brought back to RTC for validation.
