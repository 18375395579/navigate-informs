This research uses two common simulation tools developed in the U.S. and Europe, Rail Traffic Controller (RTC), and RailSys respectively, on a single shared corridor. It evaluates the potential operational benefits of a hybrid approach where output from one software (RTC) is used as input for optimization at another (RailSys) and then brought back to RTC for validation.</br>
