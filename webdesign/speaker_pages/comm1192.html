Title: Rough Set Based Approach to  Clustering Categorical Data Using Rough Set Theory<br>Author: Teresa Wu, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, Industrial Engineering Department, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States, teresa.wu@asu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This research proposes a new algorithm for clustering categorical data, termed Min-Min-Roughness, based on the Rough Set Theory, which has the ability to handle the uncertainty in the clustering process. Soybean and Zoo data sets are used to compare MMR with the results from fuzzy set based algorithms. In addition, a larger dataset, Mushroom, is used to compare MMR with Squeezer, K-modes, LCBCDC, ROCK and a traditional hierarchical algorithm.
