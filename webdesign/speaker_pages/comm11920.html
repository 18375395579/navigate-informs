Title: An Optimal Dynamic Hedging Strategy for Jet Fuel Costs<br>Author: Juliana Nascimento, Princeton University, EQuad, ORFE Department,, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, jnascime@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a dynamic strategy to hedge changes in the price of aircraft fuel using future contracts on commodities that are highly correlated with fuel. We model the commodity price using an unobservable two-factor model that allows mean-reversion in short-term prices and uncertainty in the equilibrium level to which prices revert. We combine dynamic programming and Kalman filter estimation to obtain an optimal policy that minimizes the expected costs while keeping the variance at low levels.
