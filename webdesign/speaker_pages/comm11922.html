<br>Title: Nanorod Length Estimation by Fusing Projection and Orientation Data</br><br>Author: Abhishek Shrivastava, Assistant Professor, Florida State University, 2525 Pottsdamer Street, Tallahassee, FL, 32310, United States of America, shrivastava.abhishek.k@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chiwoo Park</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Accurate and precise estimates of nanostructure dimensions are a prerequisite to use of quality engineering tools. In this talk we present a method for estimating lengths of nanorods grown in arrays. We obtain nanorod length projections from an electron micrograph and their orientation information using polarized Raman spectroscopy. We propose a statistical model to fuse this information. We will demonstrate the efficacy of the model using simulations, and a real case study.</br>
