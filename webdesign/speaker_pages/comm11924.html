<br>Title: Improving Forecasting Accuracy by Segmented Rate of Change (RoC) in Technology Forecasting using DEA</br><br>Author: Dong-Joon Lim, Portland State University, Engineering and Technology Management, Portland, OR, 97201, United States of America, tgno3.com@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tim Anderson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Technology Forecasting using Data Envelopment Analysis (TFDEA) captures technological advancement from the evolution of the State Of the Art (SOA) frontier. This study proposes a procedure to improve the forecasting accuracy by capturing local rate of change for each frontier segment that represents different product families. This approach is illustrated using previously published applications including commercial airplanes, jet fighters, LCD panels, hybrid electric vehicles, and DSLR cameras.</br>
