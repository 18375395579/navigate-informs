Title: Guess What I’m Doing Now!?  An Analytic Engine For Detection of Mode-of-motion In Humans<br>Author: Saeed Ghassemzadeh, Att Labs-Research, 180 Park Avenue, Florham Park, NJ, 07932, United States of America, saeedg@research.att.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce a generalized analytic engine which provides an algorithmic framework for detection of different modes-of-motion in human beings. The engine in turn can be used for detecting the deviation from the normal pattern and consequently correcting the anomalies.  The algorithm was developed using the geriatric data from actual human subjects.  The data was collected from ZigBEE enabled sensors embedded in the insoles of subject's slippers.
