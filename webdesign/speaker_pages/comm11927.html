Title: The Impact of Climate Policy on U.S. Aviation and High-speed Rail<br>Author: Regina Clewlow, PhD Candidate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, rclewlow@alum.mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Sussman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this study, we examine the energy and CO2 emission impacts of aviation and potential high-speed rail in major short-haul intercity corridors in the United States.  We couple a simulation model of high-speed rail and aviation demand with a general equilibrium model that examines the impact of climate policy on the U.S. on a regional scale.   We will present the modeling methodology, as well as the results of economic and emissions analyses for several policy scenarios.
