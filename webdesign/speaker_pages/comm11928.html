We model the multicriteria decision-making behavior of the various decision-makers.  We explore the dynamic evolution of the product flows, the associated product prices, as well as the levels of social responsibility activities on the network until an equilibrium pattern is achieved. We illustrate the model and computational procedure with several numerical examples.</br>
