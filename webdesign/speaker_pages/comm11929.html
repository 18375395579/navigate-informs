Title: Multi-component Rating and Collaborative Filtering for Recommender Systems<br>Author: Nachiketa Sahoo, The Heinz School of Public Policy and Management Carnegie Mellon University, nsahoo@gmail.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Collaborative filtering algorithms have been traditionally designed to work with user ratings with only one component. However, recently there has been  growing interest in using ratings on multiple aspects of items. In this work we present a mixture model based collaborative filtering algorithm for multi-component rating data. In developing this approach we draw from psychometric literature pertaining to the halo effect in multi-component rating. We evaluate the algorithm using data collected from Yahoo Movies. We found that the use of multiple components leads to improvement in recommendations over using only one component when very little training data is available.  However, it is observed that when a lot of training data is available we do not gain much from using additional components of the ratings. Beyond generating recommendation, we also show that we can use the proposed model to fill-in missing rating components. Theories in psychometric literature and the empirical evidence suggests that rating specific aspects of a subject is difficult. Hence, our exploit of the mixture model to fill in the missing component values leads to the possibility of a rater support system to facilitate gathering of multi-component ratings.
