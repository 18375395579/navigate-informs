Title: A Stochastic Dynamic Programming Approach for Transmission Investments<br>Author: Enzo Sauma, P. Universidad Catolica de Chile, Ave. Vicuña Mackenna #4860, Santiago, RM, Chile, esauma@ing.puc.cl<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We reformulate a previously-developed static model of transmission investments in restructured electricity systems using a stochastic dynamic framework. In particular, we study the optimal transmission investment strategy of a network planner based on  equilibrium models characterizing the dynamic competitive interaction among oligopolistic generation firms.
