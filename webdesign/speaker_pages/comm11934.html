Title: Tutorial on Agent-based Modeling and Simulation<br>Author: Charles Macal, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S. Cass Ave., Bldg 900-DIS, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States, macal@anl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Michael North<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a new approach to modeling systems comprised of autonomous, interacting agents.  Complex adaptive systems, emergent behavior, and self-organization are a few of the notions from ABMS.  Applications are growing rapidly in fields ranging from modeling the stock market to predicting the spread of epidemics.  This tutorial covers the foundations of ABMS, development toolkits and methods, practical aspects, and the relationship of ABMS to conventional OR.
