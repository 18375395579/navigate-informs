<br>Title: The Value of Increased Worker Qualification in Rail Dispatcher Scheduling</br><br>Author: Tony Craig, Postdoctoral Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, E40-211, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, tcraig@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: When an unplanned absence occurs among rail dispatchers, the absence must be filled using a scheduled extra board dispatcher or an overtime worker.  Dispatchers may only work positions at which they are qualified, and the number of qualifications is small compared to the number of positions.  We analyze data on historical absences, and use simulation to estimate the value of extra qualifications compared to increased staffing levels and a willingness to use overtime.</br>
