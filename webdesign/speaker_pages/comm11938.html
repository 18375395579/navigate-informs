The model is capable of generating plans in real-time, supporting both reactive and proactive decision making, and maintaining situation awareness. Bayesian belief network is employed for the belief module. Decision field theory, a cognitive approach to human decision making, is employed for the intention module. SOAR architecture is employed for the learning capability of the model.</br>
