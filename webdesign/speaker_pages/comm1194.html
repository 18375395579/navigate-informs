<br>Title: A Data-Integrated Simulation Model for Nurse Activity (Submitted for the 2006 Pierskalla Award)</br><br>Author: Durai Sundaramoorthi, Graduate Research Associate, The University of Texas at Arlington, 400 Yates Street, #217, Arlington, TX, 76010, United States, dsundaramoorthi@uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victoria Chen, Jay Rosenberger, Seoung Bum Kim</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This research develops a novel approach for constructing simulation models based on a real data set provided by Baylor Regional Medical Center (Baylor) in Grapevine, Texas. Kernel density estimates and trees were utilized to extract important knowledge about the workload of nurses from an encrypted data set provided by Baylor for four care units. Results from this data-integrated simulation of nurse-patient assignments are discussed.</br>
