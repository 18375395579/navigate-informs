Title: Leveraging Agent-Based Models for Military Analysis and Decision-Support: Techniques and Application<br>Author: Matthew Koehler, MITRE, 7515 Colshire Drive, MS: H305, McLean, VA, 22102, United States, mkoehler@mitre.org<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We have investigated the use of agent-based models for military decision-support and applied these models in a number of domains. This paper will address some techniques used in our investigations and two applications of agent-based models. The techniques include methods for examining large parameter spaces inherent within agent-based models and use of data within an agent-based model. The specific applications include Course of Action Analysis, and Acquisition and Capabilities Analysis.
