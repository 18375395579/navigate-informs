This paper will address some techniques used in our investigations and two applications of agent-based models. The techniques include methods for examining large parameter spaces inherent within agent-based models and use of data within an agent-based model. The specific applications include Course of Action Analysis, and Acquisition and Capabilities Analysis.</br>
