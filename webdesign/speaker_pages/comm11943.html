Title: Influence Diagrams for Pricing and Capacity Planning Under Uncertainty<br>Author: Barry Cobb, Virginia Military Institute, Scott Shipp Hall, Lexington, VA, United States, cobbbr@vmi.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Influence diagrams are used to model capacity and pricing decisions for a monopolist facing uncertain demand.  We examine how the optimal solution changes based on the timing of demand information and the flexibility to augment initial capacity.  Comparisons are made to analytical solutions available in economics literature.
