Title: Once More: Putting the “O?Back into Military Operations Research<br>Author: George Kuhn, LMI, 2000 Corporate Ridge, McLean, VA, 22102, United States of America, GKuhn@lmi.org<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Research results are described for two core military management topics: estimating Forces personnel attrition (casualty estimation), and forecasting unit-level requirements for aircraft (helicopter) spare parts. While being clearly different planning domains on one level, at another level the difficulties that have long burdened estimating/forecasting such requirements share a common root: unless data collection and analysis are grounded on capturing and reflecting the inherent character of military operations, estimates/forecasts will inevitably fail to describe requirements accurately. Evidence is presented that, properly grounded on describing patterns of military operations, quantitative analysis can project requirements accurately—and these results differ markedly from standard portrayals that rely on conceptual and quantitative conventions incongruent with the underlying character of military operations.
