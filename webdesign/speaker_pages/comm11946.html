<br>Title: Graph Theory-based Coarse-graining Potential Function Fitting for Atomistic Simulations</br><br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Professor, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, United States of America, satish.t.bukkapatnam@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Changqing Cheng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Atomistic molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations have been widely used to study nanomanufacturing processes, but the computational overhead has limited the simulations only to the initial nano-synthesis stage. A graph theory-based coarse-graining potential fitting approach was investigated to coarse grain the atomistic simulation, and realize large-scale simulation of the nanomanufacturing processes.</br>
