As much as 85 percent of the operating budget for some metropolitan bus systems is obtained from governmental sources.  As part of the process for obtaining funding, a relatively accurate forecast of ridership demand is necessary.  In this paper, we consider relevant factors that affect the forecast of ridership.  Alternative forecasting models are evaluated using data from a metropolitan transit authority.</br>
