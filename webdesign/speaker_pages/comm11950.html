<br>Title: On Observable Chaotic Maps for Transportation Queueing Analysis</br><br>Author: Joseph Y.J. Chow, Assistant Professor, Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON, M5B 2K3, Canada, joseph.chow@ryerson.ca</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Chaotic mapping can capture a number of characteristics in queues: transient behavior, intermittency, steady state, and complex distributions. The proposed queueing model uses chaotic mapping of inter-arrival times to generate arrivals so that parameters can be calibrated with observable data. A sample mapping based on the logistic map is presented and shown to be ergodic. A joint parameter and state estimation algorithm is presented. The advantages are studied with two connected nodes.</br>
