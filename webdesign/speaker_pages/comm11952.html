Selecting the right person to lead an IT project is challenging, especially for larger vendors who have access to a myriad pool of talent and a vast divergence in projects. A consistent method of resource allocation is critical. We develop a two-stage model to optimize the fit between IT projects and project managers and evaluate the model using data collected from a major IT vendor.</br>
