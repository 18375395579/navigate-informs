It has 7 different types of patient flow, different process times and different schedule times for each resource. The objective of this study was to identify how to simulate such a complex system. The simulation process of cancer center began with a simple model and complexity was added incrementally.  As the model increased in complexity, it became more representative of actual system.</br>
