Title: Averaging Metric Phylogenetic Trees<br>Author: Scott Provan, Professor, University of  North Carolina, Statistics and Operations Research, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-3260, United States of America, Scott_Provan@UNC.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Megan Owen, Ezra Miller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The statistical analysis of tree-like objects has been made significantly more meaningful when viewed in the framework of the phylogenetic tree space developed by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann.  We discuss properties of this space that enable an effective hybrid steepest descent algorithm to be constructed for finding sample means.  We give two applications:  reconstructing species trees from gene trees, and comparing the structure of blood vessels in the brain.
