Title: Empirical Dynamic Complex Network Model of Genetic Expression Processes<br>Author: Hoang Tran, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, United States of America, hoangmt@ostatemail.okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we present an approach to reconstruct the nonlinear dynamics of a complex network from a high-dimensional vector time-series based on causality analysis. It overcomes the challenges associated with sparse time samples, large parameter space, and the need for accurate priors with previous Bayesian network models. Our method is applied to study the data set on genetic expression of Drosophila melanogaster using a sequence of DNA microarray data.
