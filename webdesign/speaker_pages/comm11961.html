<br>Title: Rank-based Process Control for Mixed-Type Data</br><br>Author: Dong Ding, HKUST, HKUST, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, dding@ust.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fugee Tsung, Jian Li</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Conventional control charts focus on either continuous or categorical data monitoring separately. However little literature deals with mixed-type data monitoring when both continuous and categorical observations exist. We utilize ordinal information in the categorical variables and propose an efficient control chart based on standardized ranks. Simulation results show that the proposed chart is effective in detecting location shifts and robust to various distributions.</br>
