Title: Personalized Biopsy Referral Decision Modeling in the Presence of Breast Cancer Regression<br>Author: Fan Wang, University of Arkansas, Department of Industrial Engineering, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, fxw005@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shengfan Zhang, Kathleen Diehl<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Mammography, the current standard modality for breast cancer screening, is not perfect. Biopsy is often performed to verify the presence of cancer after positive results. We developed a discrete time finite-horizon Markov decision process model to optimize biopsy referral policies based on total expected quality-adjusted life years. The model incorporates individual’s breast cancer risk factors and mammogram screening history and allows the possibility of spontaneous disease regression.
