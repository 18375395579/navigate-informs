Biopsy is often performed to verify the presence of cancer after positive results. We developed a discrete time finite-horizon Markov decision process model to optimize biopsy referral policies based on total expected quality-adjusted life years. The model incorporates individual’s breast cancer risk factors and mammogram screening history and allows the possibility of spontaneous disease regression.</br>
