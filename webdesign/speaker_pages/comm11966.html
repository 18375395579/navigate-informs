<br>Title: Dependencies Among Multiple Quality Responses: Characterization and Aggregation for Prediction</br><br>Author: Leman Esra Dolgun, Anadolu University, Industrial Engineering Department, Eskisehir, 26555, Turkey, ledolgun@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gülser Köksal, Nimetullah Burnak</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present results of a structured survey with several quality control experts to characterize preferential and statistical dependencies among multiple quality responses. We then consider aggregation of these responses via Choquet integral for predictive modeling. The method is tested for different dependence situations identified through the survey. We elaborate on design of the reference alternatives to control the number of comparisons required to capture the expertise of the decision maker.</br>
