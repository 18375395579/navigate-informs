Title: Information Sharing and Cooperation in Multi-Agent Systems<br>Author: David Jeffcoat, Eglin AFB, jeffcoatd@eglin.af.mil<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This research is concerned with the modeling and analysis of cooperation within a heterogeneous, multi-agent team.  Our focus is on a special form of cooperation, namely information sharing.  The objective is to develop mathematical models for cooperation via information sharing in complex large-scale systems.  The approach is based on the techniques of discrete-state, continuous-time Markov chain models.  The primary application context is the search for targets in a combat scenario.
