<br>Title: Fixing Phantom Stockouts: A POS-Based Shelf Inspection Model</br><br>Author: Li Chen, Assistant Professor, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, li.chen@duke.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Phantom stockout is a retail stockout phenomenon caused by shelf execution failure and/or product shrinkage (e.g., theft and spoilage).  In this paper, we propose a simple but effective partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model to tackle this problem.  We show that the optimal shelf inspection policy is a threshold policy based on the number of consecutive zero-sales periods.  We further extend the analysis to models with time-varying parameters.</br>
