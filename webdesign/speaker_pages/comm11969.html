<br>Title: Multi-Flight Demand Untruncation with Recapture</br><br>Author: Richard Ratliff, Sabre Holdings, Richard.Ratliff@sabre-holdings.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We discuss a new method for demand untruncation using origin-destination booking activity across multiple flights in a market. This approach involves choice models which estimate market-class group demand across flights. We give closed-form solutions for estimating flight spill and recapture, unique to the specific pattern of flight closures and bookings. Computational experience with this methodology shows considerable promise in reducing forecast errors.</br>
