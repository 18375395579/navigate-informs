Title: Achieving Optimal Solution Performance for your Optimization Modeling Project<br>Author: Sandip Pindoria, Maximal Software, United Kingdom, sandip@maximalsoftware.co.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Bjarni Kristjansson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: When working with real world, large-scale models there are many factors that come into play how to gain the optimum speed. In addition to choosing the correct solver algorithms and tuning solver parameters, other factors include how the model is formulated for sparsity, where the data resides, and what hardware gives best results. In this presentation, we will report on our experiences at Maximal in solving and tuning difficult models for our customers.
