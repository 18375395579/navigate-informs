<br>Title: The Masking Effect of Averages for Healthcare Capacity Modeling</br><br>Author: Louis Luangkesorn, Research Assistant Professor, University of Pittsburgh, 3700 O'Hara St., 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, United States of America, lol11@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Theologos Bountourelis, Spencer Nabors, Mina Kabiri, Andrew Schaefer, Gilles Clermont</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Health care capacity decisions are often based on average performance metrics such as occupancy, however these may hide the effects of variability in the system.    We demonstrate that occupancy and similar metrics do not reflect the ability of a healthcare system to provide patient service and propose using service based metrics for congestion as more suitable for healthcare settings.  We then provide a case study where these metrics were used to advise a capacity expansion project.</br>
