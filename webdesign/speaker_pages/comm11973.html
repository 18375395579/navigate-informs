Title: Optimal Sensor Locations for Providing Freeway Travel Times<br>Author: Jeff Ban, Assistant Research Engineer, CCIT, University of California, Berkeley, 2105 Bancroft Way, Berkeley, CA, 94804, United States, xban@calccit.org<br>Coauthor(s): J.D. Margulici, Ryan Herring, Alexandre Bayen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this presentation, we show that determination of the optimal sensor locations for providing travel times can be modeled using dynamic programming. The model can be solved via a shortest-path search on an acyclic network constructed via available information from vehicle trajectories. Some results are shown for applying the model on two simple and widely used travel time calculation methods: the instantaneous and dynamic travel times using loop detectors.
