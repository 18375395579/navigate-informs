Title: Bayesian Downscaling of Outputs from Numerical Model Output<br>Author: Veronica Berrocal, Duke University, 920 Clarendon Street, Durham, NC, United States of America, vjb2@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Gelfand<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In many environmental problems data arise from two sources: numerical models and monitoring networks. The first source provides predictions at the level of grid cells, while the second source gives measurements at points. Accommodating the spatial misalignment between the two types of data is of fundamental importance. In this paper we propose a simple method to downscale the output from numerical models to point level using spatially varying coefficient modeled as correlated Gaussian processes.
