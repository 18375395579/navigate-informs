Title: On-line Steady-state Detection Based on Multiple Change-point Models Using Particle Filters<br>Author: Jianguo Wu, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States of America, wu45@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shiyu Zhou, Xiaochun Li, Yong Chen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Steady-state detection is critical in process performance assessment, fault detection and process control. We proposed a robust on-line steady-state detection algorithm using multiple change-point model and particle filtering techniques. The steady-state detection problem is formulated as a multiple change-point problem using a segmental linear model.
