Title: A Family of Growth Models for Representing Price Evolution in Online Auctions<br>Author: Galit Shmueli, University of Maryland, Robert H Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, United States, gshmueli@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wolfgang Jank, Valerie Hyde<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Bids in online auctions arrive at discrete timepoints. We represent the continuous price-process as a functional object. Typical nonparametric smoothing (e.g., p-splines or monotone splines) used to estimate price curves from observed discrete bid data has several limitations. We present a parametric family of growth models that overcomes these limitations. It is parsimonious, insightful, and useful. A measure of fit and automated fitting algorithm are provided. eBay data used for illustration.
