We developed a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of darunavir versus other protease inhibitors in treatment-experienced adults.  The model tracks the remaining lifetime of a treatment-experienced cohort by virologic and immunologic response to treatment.  We discuss this model with an emphasis on the application of modeling techniques to HIV.</br>
