Title: Cost-effectiveness of Darunavir for Treatment-experienced Adults with HIV Infection in the US<br>Author: Anita Brogan, Senior Director, Health Economics, RTI Health Solutions, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, RTP, NC, 27709, United States of America, abrogan@rti.org<br>Coauthor(s): Erik Smets, Silas Martin, Josephine Mauskopf<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Darunavir is a novel protease inhibitor used with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV infection.  We developed a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of darunavir versus other protease inhibitors in treatment-experienced adults.  The model tracks the remaining lifetime of a treatment-experienced cohort by virologic and immunologic response to treatment.  We discuss this model with an emphasis on the application of modeling techniques to HIV.
