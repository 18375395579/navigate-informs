Title: Optimal Resource Capacity Management for Stochastic Networks<br>Author: Ton Dieker, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, ton.dieker@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Soumyadip Ghosh, Mark Squillante<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a general framework for determining the optimal resource capacity for each station comprising a stochastic network, motivated by applications arising in computer capacity planning and business process management. In this talk we propose an iterative methodology that relies only on the capability of observing the queue lengths at all network stations given any resource  capacity allocation.  We theoretically investigate the proposed methodology for single-class Brownian tree networks, and further illustrate the use our methodology and the quality of its results  through extensive numerical results.
