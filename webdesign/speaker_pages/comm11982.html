In this talk we propose an iterative methodology that relies only on the capability of observing the queue lengths at all network stations given any resource  capacity allocation.  We theoretically investigate the proposed methodology for single-class Brownian tree networks, and further illustrate the use our methodology and the quality of its results  through extensive numerical results.</br>
