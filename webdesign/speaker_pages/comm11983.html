Title: The Development of MALTA  for Regional Mass Evacuation Simulation Modeling<br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E. 2nd St., Tucson, AZ, United States, chiu@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jorge Villalobos, Pitu Mirchandani<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The requirement of the large-scale modeling calls for the development of the Multi-Resolution Assignment and Loading of Traffic Activities (MALTA). This talk presents the spatially scalable dynamic traffic assignment (SSDTA) based modeling approach in MALTA that is of particular advantage for large-scale traffic modeling. Modeling approaches and system framework are presented. We will also present one particular example of applying MALTA to a major U.S. metropolitan area.
