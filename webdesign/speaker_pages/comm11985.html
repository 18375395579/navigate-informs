Title: Using Design Structure Matrix to Improve Product Development Performance<br>Author: Sappinandana Akamphon, Massachussets Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue Rm E40-422, Cambridge, MA, 02144, United States, sup@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bob Bordley, Richard Roth, Daniel Reaume, Randolph Kirchain<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Product development is a highly complex process with intricate network of dependency between various activities. Design structure matrix (DSM) has been developed to model the interdependency and repetitive problem solving nature of product development processes. By combining DSM, activity time and cost distributions, along with Monte-Carlo simulation, the total cost or time effect of a change can be approximated to identify activities with highest impact.
