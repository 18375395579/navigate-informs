Following the tradition of structural estimation models in Econometrics, we assume that the decision maker acts rationally and chooses the optimal decision for a cost function that is un-observable for us as researchers. Based on the observed decision making and a set of co-variates, we use Maximum Likelihood estimation to obtain the cost parameters describing the latent cost function.</br>
