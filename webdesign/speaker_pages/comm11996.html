By testing fundamental queuing theory results via regression analysis, we quantify how expected delays increase with aircraft utilization, and also how capacity flexibility and variance in travel time along a route impact flight delays at any level of aircraft utilization.  We also analyze scenarios that provide useful insights into airline scheduling decisions.</br>
