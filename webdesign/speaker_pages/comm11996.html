Title: An Empirical Investigation into the Causes of Airline Flight Delays<br>Author: Kamalini Ramdas, Ramdask@Darden.virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Williams<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine why airlines differ systematically in their on time performance. By testing fundamental queuing theory results via regression analysis, we quantify how expected delays increase with aircraft utilization, and also how capacity flexibility and variance in travel time along a route impact flight delays at any level of aircraft utilization.  We also analyze scenarios that provide useful insights into airline scheduling decisions.
