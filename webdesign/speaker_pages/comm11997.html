In this study, we develop an Analytic Network Process (ANP) model that evaluates the multiple dimensions of outsourcing decisions within a corporate environment. The implementation of ANP is illustrated on a real life application and the results are evaluated by examining the fundamental principles of the methodology and elements of the model.
