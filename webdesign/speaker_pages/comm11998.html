Title: Knowledge Discovery from Heterogeneous Data for Risk-informed Decisions to Facilitate Rapid Response<br>Author: Olufemi Omitaomu, Research Associate, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1 Bethel Valley Road, MS 6017, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831, United States of America, omitaomuoa@ornl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Auroop Ganguly<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Heterogeneous data from wide-area sensor infrastructures are processed through innovative knowledge discovery methodologies to develop multivariate characterizations of normal behavior, which in turn produces risk-based delineation of unusual behavior. The approach is illustrated in the context of transportation safety and security. A risk-based assessment is developed to categorize commercial trucks into safety or security hazards based on their weight profiles and radioactive signatures.
