One issue associated with its operation is how to evaluate the quality of a service tested in a laboratory environment. We present a service quality evaluation scheme for a service laboratory environment, consisting of two parts: a repository of service evaluation criteria and a guideline to select pertinent criteria for a particular case study. The result of a case study will also be presented.
