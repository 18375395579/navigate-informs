Title: Donor-Dependent Scoring Schemes: Shaping the Allocation of Cadaver Kidneys in a New Era<br>Author: Yichuan Ding, University of British Columbia, 4735 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, V6T1C3, Canada, Daniel.Ding@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Stefanos Zenios, Baris Ata<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper undertakes a modeling based analysis of scoring systems which are used to allocate cadaver kidneys to patients on the waitlist. We use a fluid model to approximate the transplant waitlist, and assume that patients make rational decisions based on the predictions from the fluid model. We show that at the equilibrium state, a donor-dependent ranking system increases the chance of survival-based matching and enables the acceptance of kidneys when compared to a donor-independent system.
