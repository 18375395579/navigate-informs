Chang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods in profile analysis involve one profile only. This study examines three methods on monitoring multiple correlated nonlinear profiles using B-spline modeling and multivariate EWMA control charts. A two-profile simulation study is conducted to generate average run lengths for comparison. A real-world data set from a vulcanization process is used to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed methods.</br>
