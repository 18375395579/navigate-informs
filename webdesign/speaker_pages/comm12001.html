Procedures were developed to estimate and monitor the hard-to-measure cutter tilts by integrating cutting force modeling and surface data patterns. A Ford case study has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research also establishes a theoretical framework of surface characterization driven by process physics.</br>
