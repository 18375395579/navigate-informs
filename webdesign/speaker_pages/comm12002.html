The operational cost of providing a service at an ATM is much lower than that of providing the same service by a bank teller. Furthermore, the initial cost of installing an ATM is reasonable. These facts make ATMs an important alternative channel for the bank branches.  The main objective of this case study is to help students improve their empirical modeling, analysis, and decision support skills. It is designed to help students understand how regression models should be developed and used to support decisions under uncertainty.</br>
