Title: Private Valuation of Claims using Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Alan King, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, kingaj@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Olga Streltchenko<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Valuing contingent claims can be formulated as a stochastic programming problem.  We explore the advantages of the SP model in modeling realistic aspects of investing, including: calibration constraints, existing positions, spreads, and risk preferences.  Capturing these realistic features of investing and hedging leads to a paradigm in which investors can construct and calibrate a private valuation measure for the evaluation of trades and the pricing of illiquid positions.
