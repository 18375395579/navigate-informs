We explore the advantages of the SP model in modeling realistic aspects of investing, including: calibration constraints, existing positions, spreads, and risk preferences.  Capturing these realistic features of investing and hedging leads to a paradigm in which investors can construct and calibrate a private valuation measure for the evaluation of trades and the pricing of illiquid positions.</br>
