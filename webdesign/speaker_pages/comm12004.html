We describe the approach we have used in the SP component of the LINDO API  optimization library. The two major tasks are eliciting from the user: 1) sequencing of decisions and random events, and 2) distributions of random variables, including dependencies. This library is accessible via the spreadsheet add-in What’sBest! and the modelling languages GAMS and LINGO.</br>
