Title: A Novel Framework for Beam Angle Optimization in Radiation Therapy<br>Author: Hamed Yarmand, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Francis H.

We use the dose to OARs in the ideal plan, which uses all candidate beams, to find the plan with the minimum number of beams and a predetermined maximum deviation from the ideal plan. We use mixed integer programming (MIP) for optimization and two heuristics to reduce the computation time.
