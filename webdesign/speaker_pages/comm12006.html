<br>Title: A Novel Framework for Beam Angle Optimization in Radiation Therapy</br><br>Author: Hamed Yarmand, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center, 30 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, 02114, United States of America, yarmand.hamed@mgh.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Craft</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Two important elements of a radiation therapy treatment plan are quality (measured based on the target coverage and dose to organs at risk (OARs)) and delivery time, heavily depending on the number of beams. We use the dose to OARs in the ideal plan, which uses all candidate beams, to find the plan with the minimum number of beams and a predetermined maximum deviation from the ideal plan. We use mixed integer programming (MIP) for optimization and two heuristics to reduce the computation time.</br>
