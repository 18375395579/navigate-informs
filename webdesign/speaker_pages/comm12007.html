This introduces an error component in the simulated performance that is not usually captured in the analysis of simulation output data, which affects the coverage probability of confidence intervals.  Often this error dominates the error caused by the finite length of the simulation run.  Under certain conditions bootstrap methods can provide intervals with approximately correct coverage.</br>
