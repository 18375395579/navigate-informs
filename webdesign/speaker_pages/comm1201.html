Title: Planning for Demand Failure: A Dynamic Lot Size Model for Clinical Trial Supply Chains<br>Author: Adam Fleischhacker, Rutgers University, 180 University Ave #35, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, adam_fleischhacker@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Yao Zhao<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: How much of a product do you manufacture if demand for that product may disappear?  To answer this question, we generalize the Wagner-Whitin (W-W) model to incorporate the risk of disappearing demand.  We highlight this model’s applicability and relevance to the clinical trial drug supply chain.  In addition, we show how to transform this stochastic model into the deterministic W-W model and thus, one can directly apply decades of W-W model results in cases where demand may suddenly cease.
