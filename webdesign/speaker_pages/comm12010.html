Title: Calibration of Mesoscopic Traffic Simulation Models Using Population Based Evolutionary Algorithms<br>Author: Fabrice Marchal, Laboratory of Transportation Economics (LET), Lyon, France, fabrice.marchal@let.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to calibrate dynamic traffic simulation models with real data acquired from traffic counts and travel time measurements acquired from GPS devices. The methodology is demonstrated on the city of Lyon with the mesoscopic traffic simulation tool METROPOLIS that features a departure time choice model based on the work of W.Vickrey.   The methodology calibrates the demand and supply parameters as well as the departure time choice parameters.
