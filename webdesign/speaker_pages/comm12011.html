<br>Title: A General Framework for Cooperation under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Ulas Ozen, Researcher, Bell Labs Ireland, Alcatel-Lucent, Alcatel-Lucent, Blanchardstown Industrial Park, Dublin, 15, Ireland, uozen@alcatel-lucent.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Henk Norde, Marco Slikker</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general framework for situations with decision making under uncertainty and cooperation possibilities. This framework is based upon a two stage stochastic programming approach. We show that under relatively mild assumptions the cooperative games associated with these situations are totally balanced and, hence, have non-empty cores. Finally, we consider several example situations, which can be studied using this general framework.</br>
