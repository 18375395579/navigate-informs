We will demonstrate some real-world MPL models that have been formulated as web-based applications using the MPL OptiMax Component Library.  A Portfolio Optimization model will be explored and shown how it can be iterated to produce a trade-off curve (Efficient Frontier) between the Return and Risk.  A Vehicle Routing application with multiple vehicles and depots. We will also demonstrate a Nurse Rostering application with multiple contract rules and objective criterias.</br>
