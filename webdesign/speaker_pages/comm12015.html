<br>Title: Real-Time Yield Management of e-Services</br><br>Author: Parijat Dube, IBM Research, 19 Skyline Drive, Hawthorne, NY, 10532, United States, pdube@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yezekael Hayel</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a framework for real-time yield management of e-services. The framework employs demand forecasting, yield management and customer behavior monitoring modules. The quality of service measure is the expected delay and using queueing theory we model the dependence of the expected delay on the demand, customer choices and providers' capacity. Using numerical examples we show the gain in revenue that can be realised by firms in markets with different buying power of customers.</br>
