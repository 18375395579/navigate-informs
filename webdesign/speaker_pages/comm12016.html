Box 94079, Amsterdam, 1090 GB, Netherlands, Han.La.Poutre@cwi.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Valentin Robu, Pieter Jan 't Hoen, Han Noot</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present research results on the reduction of CO2 emission by intelligent truck usage, as part of the Dutch research program Energy, Ecology, and Technology. We describe market-based, automated techniques for cargo allocation to trucks and transportation companies. We present agent-based models and interactive simulation systems. We model the players by agents and design bidding strategies. We also describe how to get robustness in the results of adaptive simulation systems.</br>
