Art Chaovalitwongse, Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Rd, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, wchaoval@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ya-Ju Fan, Rajesh Sachdeo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present new optimization models used in epilepsy treatment to classify different physiological states of the brain from electroencephalograms (EEGs). The proposed technique is used to select the brain areas that best classify seizure susceptibility (pre-seizure) and normal periods. The empirical results show that the proposed technique achieves an average sensitivity and an average specificity over 80% in 10 patients.</br>
