<br>Title: Modeling the Community Care Services for Alternate Level of Care (ALC) Patients: A Queuing Network A</br><br>Author: Pedram Noghani, MSc student, University of Ottawa, unit 929- 2660 Norberry Crescent, Ottawa, On, k1v6n2, Canada, pedram.noghani@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we try to model the alternative level of care (ALC) patients flow to show the effect of downstream capacities on number of ALC patients and their length of stays in acute care facilities. We develop queuing network model to capture patients flow using a heuristic approximation method to find the steady state parameters of the model.</br>
