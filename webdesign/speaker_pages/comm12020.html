Title: Strategic Resource Planning for Seismic Retrofit of Transportation Networks<br>Author: Fan Peng, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Dept. of Civil & Environmental Eng, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, fanpeng2@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Liang Chang, Yanfeng Ouyang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Retrofitting seismically-vulnerable transportation infrastructure (e.g., bridges) is essential in mitigating network functional loss and facilitating emergency evacuation. We propose an optimal resource planning model to prioritize seismic retrofit projects in a bridge network. Effective solution algorithms based on Lagrangian relaxation are developed. Numerical results of empirical examples are presented.
