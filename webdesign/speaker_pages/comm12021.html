Title: A Surrogate Model Approximating the Performance of the Compass Model<br>Author: Gary Kochenberger, University of Colorado at Denver, Denver, CO, gary.kochenberger@cudenver.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Manuel Laguna, Candy Brinkman, Jim Kelly<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: COMPASS is an agent-based model designed to simulate the flow of sailors through the sequence of career decisions.  While COMPASS holds great promise as a policy evaluation tool, it is, by its very nature, computationally cumbersome.  To address these computational issues, we are developing a surrogate model to approximate COMPASS with enough accuracy to provide good  starting points for policy variables.
