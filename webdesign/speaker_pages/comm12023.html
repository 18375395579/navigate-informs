<br>Title: Multivariate Statistical Process Control using Approximate Likelihood Ratio</br><br>Author: Elsayed Elsayed, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, United States of America, elsayed@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abdel Magid Hamouda, Myong K (MK) Jeong, Khalifa N. Al-Khalif, JINHO KIM</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present a new multivariate SPC (MSPC) chart for monitoring the mean vector change of a multivariate normal process. The chart utilizes an approximate likelihood ratio of a central and a noncentral chi-square distribution, which can be approximated by a central chi-square distribution having different degrees of freedom. We integrate the likelihood ratio into a multivariate CUSUM scheme for small shifts detection and provide performance comparisons with other MSPC charts.</br>
