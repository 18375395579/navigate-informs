Al-Khalif, JINHO KIM<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present a new multivariate SPC (MSPC) chart for monitoring the mean vector change of a multivariate normal process. The chart utilizes an approximate likelihood ratio of a central and a noncentral chi-square distribution, which can be approximated by a central chi-square distribution having different degrees of freedom. We integrate the likelihood ratio into a multivariate CUSUM scheme for small shifts detection and provide performance comparisons with other MSPC charts.
