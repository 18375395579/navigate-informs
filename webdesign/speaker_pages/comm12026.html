Title: Improving the Reliability of Treatment Effect Estimates using the BOSS Model<br>Author: Jason Sauppe, PhD Student, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 201 North Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, sauppe1@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sheldon Jacobson, Edward Sewell<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Deriving unbiased causal inferences from observational (non-random) data requires some method of adjustment to control for potential confounding factors. The Balance Optimization Subset Selection (BOSS) model formulates these adjustments as an optimization problem and uses the solution to make causal inferences. These inferences can be strengthened by using alternate optima to provide second opinions, either enhancing confidence or suggesting the presence of unobserved factors.
