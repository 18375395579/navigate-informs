Title: Long-term Extraction and Backfill Scheduling in a Complex Underground Mine<br>Author: Donal O'Sullivan, Colorado School of Mines, 1500 Illinois St., Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, dosulliv@mines.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alexandra Newman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We use an integer programming model to optimize production at a complex underground mining operation. Mine managers seek to maximize metal production while using a mixture of mining methods to extract the ore.  We apply a sliding time window heuristic to solve for a four year schedule with weekly fidelity.
