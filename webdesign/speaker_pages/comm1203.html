Title: Using 911 Call Records to Identify Potential Pre-Terror Attack Surveillance<br>Author: John S. Hollywood, RTI International, jhollywood@rti.org<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a methodology for processing, filtering and analyzing 911 call records to identify potential pre-terror attack site surveillance. We have tested this methodology successfully on a major city's 911 call data, processing over 1.3 million records to identify a handful of locations of interest. We also found that ethnic profiling would have failed to detect the majority of potential surveillance incidents, and that using text and data mining tools provided only a marginal benefit over call type and keyword-based search and analysis.
