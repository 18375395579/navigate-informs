Title: Evaluating the Potential of Radio Frequency Ablation for the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer<br>Author: Lauren Cipriano, Research Scientist, Institute for Technology Assessment, 101 Merrimac Street, 10th Floor, Boston, MA, 02114, United States, Lauren@mgh-ita.org<br>Coauthor(s): Chung Yin Kong, Pamela McMahon, Scott Gazelle, Jo-anne Shepard, Michael Lanuti<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Due to high rates of comorbid disease not all early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients are eligible for potentially curative surgical resection.  Radiofrequency ablation of early stage lung cancers has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in small studies,  but long term data are unavailable.  Using a microsimulation model of lung cancer we determine the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of using radiofrequency ablation to treat patients ineligible for ideal conventional therapy.
