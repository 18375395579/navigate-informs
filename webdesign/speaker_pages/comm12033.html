Title: Next Generation Emergency Location Tools: Heuristics with Simulation<br>Author: Hari Rajagopalan, Associate Professor, Francis Marion University, P.O. Box 100547, Florence, SC, 29502, United States of America, HRajagopalan@fmarion.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cem Saydam, Elizabeth Sharer, Muhammad Zaffar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Location models for emergency response systems have rapidly evolved from the initial mathematical models which required many simplifying assumptions to make the models tractable. In this paper, we discuss the use of simulation with meta-heurstic search methods in location models to bring more realism and generate a richer output to get a better insight on the effectiveness of location models.
