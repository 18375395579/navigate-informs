The proposed class of models provides two major benefits. First, it allows capturing assumptions on the diffusion process that are not traditionally captured by extant models, such as heterogeneity in the number of social ties. Second, the proposed models may be calibrated shortly after launch using a combination of aggregate data and disaggregate data.</br>
