<br>Title: A Model of Mental Accounting and Reference Price Adaptation</br><br>Author: Woonam Hwang, PhD Candidate, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, whwang.phd2009@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Manel Baucells</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a modification of discounted utility that incorporates a process of mental accounting. Consumers hold reference prices in mind, which they use to calculate the book value at which items enter and exit the mental account. Reference prices are endogenously determined. The model explains a wide array of observed anomalies such as reluctance to trading, sunk-cost effects, payment depreciation, preference for pre-payment, and the flat-rate bias. We compare our model with existing models.</br>
