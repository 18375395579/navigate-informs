<br>Title: Using Surrogates to Calculate Sensitivity Analysis While Optimizing</br><br>Author: Genetha Gray, Sandia National Labs, P.O. Box 969, MS 9159, Livermore, CA, 94551-0969, United States of America, gagray@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): John D. Siirola, Ethan Chan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we will describe how hybridization can be used incorporate sensitivity analysis into optimization procedures.  Specifically, by dynamically incorporating Bayesian sensitivity techniques into the minimization process, we will show how the usefulness of computational models can be drastically improved.  We will review the basic hybridization algorithm and resulting software.  We will also give some ideas for useful hybrids and show some results for a real world problem.</br>
