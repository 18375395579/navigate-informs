<br>Title: Revisiting the NH needle exchange program: A sensitivity test for deviations from uniform sampling</br><br>Author: Donald Lee, Yale University, 135 Prospect St, Box 208200, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States of America, donald.lee@yale.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Program evaluation relies critically on the quality of and methodology for outcome measurement. However, it is often difficult to obtain information on outcomes for the entire population, or even a representative sample. We introduce a sensitivity test for deviations from equal probability sampling of units, and use it to test the robustness of the reported outcomes in the New Haven needle exchange program. Joint work with Peter Aronow (Yale Political Science).</br>
