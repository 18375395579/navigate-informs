Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, ktarun@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Gyana Parija, Vinayaka Pandit<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a stochastic programming model to help BPO firms make optimal workforce hiring and deployment decisions across all the business processes. The model uses MILP approach to minimize the total cost of managing the workforce. It uses scenario trees to model stochastic demand. We further present two scenarios of usage of the model that optimize the client’s effectiveness metric and enable firms to provide differentiated services by entering into revenue sharing agreement with the client.
