This work presents a hybrid model that can design clauses for sustaining construction contracts. The model integrates multi-objective linear programming model with stochastic dynamic programming model. The model incorporates uncertainty, multiple objectives and sustainable provisions. A case study is included as a means to demonstrate the use of the model.</br>
