However, they have only been proposed to model the aging rate of a single machine and the available literature on developing maintenance strategies based on equivalent age is preliminary. Thus, the objective of our work is to allow for multiple machine configurations with dependencies, while triggering maintenance based on multiobjective optimization routines and experimental results.</br>
