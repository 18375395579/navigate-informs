Supply chain risks can be quantified in terms of potential loss of money, time, or material through simulation. Consequently, risk management strategies can be optimized through a simulation-optimization methodology and evaluated by performing a cost-benefit analysis. In this paper, the proposed approach is demonstrated using a refinery supply chain case study.</br>
