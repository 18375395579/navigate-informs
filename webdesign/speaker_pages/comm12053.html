<br>Title: System Reliability Prediction based on Component-level Prognostics Information</br><br>Author: Zhigang Tian, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, tian@ciise.concordia.ca</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Prognostics can be performed directly for individual components. However, failure time of an individual system can not be predicted directly based on the component prognostics information. In this work, we propose a system reliability analysis framework and methods based on component prognostics information. A method is presented to evaluate system failure time distribution based on predicted component failure time distributions.</br>
