Title: Learning Logistic Demand Curves in Business-to-Business Pricing<br>Author: Huashuai Qu, University of Maryland, 1305 Mathematics Building, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, huashuai@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Fu, Ilya Ryzhov<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose an approximate Bayesian model for predicting the win/loss probability for a given price in business-to-business pricing. This model allows us to learn parameters in logistic regression based on binary data and can be quickly updated after each new observation. We also derive an approach for price bidding, allowing decision-maker to achieve multiple objectives by integrating the uncertainties. We test the statistical model and the bidding strategy with synthetic and real data.
