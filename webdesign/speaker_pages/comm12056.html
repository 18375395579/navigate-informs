This model allows us to learn parameters in logistic regression based on binary data and can be quickly updated after each new observation. We also derive an approach for price bidding, allowing decision-maker to achieve multiple objectives by integrating the uncertainties. We test the statistical model and the bidding strategy with synthetic and real data.</br>
