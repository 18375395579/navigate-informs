What strategies can a casino use to retain player loyalty? What’s the best way to pay a healthcare provider for patient outcomes? Incentive issues in OM are traditionally analyzed using principal-agent models, but these are impractical because some required components (e.g. agent cost function) are rarely ever known. This talk introduces a practical, data-driven remedy that will be applied to Medicare’s dialysis payment system.</br>
