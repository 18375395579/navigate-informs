Red tickets are mandatory to be fixed by law but not yellow tickets. We proposed a risk model to prioritize yellow tickets by estimating its derailment risk. Given the inputs from risk model and other constraints, a repair schedule optimization model was developed to further reduce total cost on potential derailment and maintenance.</br>
