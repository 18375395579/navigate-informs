Data often consist of observations of the process at arbitrary times, so that the exact times when the state changes are unobserved. For example, the progression of chronic diseases is often described by stages of severity, and the state of the patient may only be known at doctor or hospital visits. We conduct an exploratory study using multi-state Markov models to examine various implied volatility regimes using data on currency options. Volatility regimes are nothing more than states of the world defined by volatility characteristics. We also estimate transition probabilities of going from one volatility regime to another, as well as 'lengths of stay' - the length of time of each regime. Our results have implications in selecting an optimal trading strategy from a set of rules-based strategies.</br>
