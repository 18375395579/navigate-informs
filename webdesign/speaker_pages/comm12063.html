Title: Skart: A Skewness- and Autoregression-adjusted Batch-means Procedure for Simulation Analysis<br>Author: James Wilson, Professor, North Carolina State University, 111 Lampe Drive, Campus Box 7906, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, jwilson@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ali Tafzzoli, Emily Lada, Natalie Steiger<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss Skart, an automated sequential batch-means  procedure for constructing a skewness- and  autoregression-adjusted confidence interval for the  steady-state mean of a simulation output process that  satisfies user-specified requirements on (absolute or  relative) precision and coverage probability.  In an  extensive performance evaluation, Skart compared favorably  with ASAP3, WASSP, SBatch, ABATCH, LBATCH, and the  Heidelberger-Welch and Law-Carson procedures.
