In this work, we present a degradation framework that characterizes the interactions among the degradation  processes of components and predict component residual life times using real-time sensory data. We conduct a series of simulation studies and compare the performance of our approach with a benchmark model. The results show that our prediction of the residual life distribution is more accurate, compared with the benchmark model, in which component interactions are not taken into account.</br>
