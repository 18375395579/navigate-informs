This framework lacks a mathematical rigor that models the processing and feedback processes in a capacity constrained system. This research develops a dynamic mathematical model and solution approach for representing dynamic information flow and processing from sensors to commanders within this Dynamic Model of Situated Cognition framework.</br>
