Title: C++ Algorithmic Differentiation by Operator Overloading<br>Author: Brad Bell, Mathematician, Applied Physica Laboratory, University of Washington, 1013 NE 40th Street, Seattle, WA, 98105-6698, United States, bradbell@washington.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Reverse mode algorithmic differentiation calculates a gradient using a small multiple of the number of operations required to compute an objective. This requires storing the operations and values corresponding to the objective. As memory gets larger, reverse mode can be efficiently applied in more cases. We present a C++ templated objective and use it with float, double, and the AD types defined by ADOLC, CppAD, and FADBAD. The gradient computation time using these AD packages is compared.
