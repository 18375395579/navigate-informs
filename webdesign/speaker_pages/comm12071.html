<br>Title: Bringing Geospatially Enriched Environments into Simulation for Unmanned Ground Vehicle Assessment</br><br>Author: Suzanne Delong, US Army ERDC, ATTN:GM-M, 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS, 39180, United States of America, suzanne.delong@usma.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joyce Nagle, Niki Goerger</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Geospatially enriched synthetic environments are needed for development and assessment of unmanned ground vehicle performance to support sensor fusion and sense making. How can the high  fidelity/resolution environment achieved via high performance computing be integrated to inform simulations addressing critical questions? This presentation will address the investigation of a multi-resolution modeling capability and results and lessons learned in developing an experiment for proof of concept.</br>
