Rare event modeling is based on impactful real events that result in state changes.  Our framework generates scenarios for DoD planning. Our template-, network- and measure-based methodology takes into account military concepts that integrate perspectives, network database structures, and informative measures of significance.  This system provides a basis for force planning and technology decisions.</br>
