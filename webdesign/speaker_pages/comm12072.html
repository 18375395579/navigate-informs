Title: Using Operations Research and Networks to Generate Scenarios and Analyze Wargames<br>Author: David Arney, United States Military Academy, Department of Mathematics, West Point, United States of America, david.arney@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kira Hutchinson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Scenario generation and war-gaming must incorporate the complexities of the real world. Rare event modeling is based on impactful real events that result in state changes.  Our framework generates scenarios for DoD planning. Our template-, network- and measure-based methodology takes into account military concepts that integrate perspectives, network database structures, and informative measures of significance.  This system provides a basis for force planning and technology decisions.
