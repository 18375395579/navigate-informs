Title: Perspectives on Robust Design<br>Author: Kailash Kapur, Professor, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, kkapur@u.washington.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: If we define robustness as excellent performance or continuous survival under changing and uncontrollable factors or under factors that are not controlled or managed using rational decisions, then achieving robustness is a natural process for any physical or biological system. Some perspectives on the philosophy of robustness using examples related to reliability, product design and organizational design will be presented.
