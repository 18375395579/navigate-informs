Title: Models of Searching and Browsing: Studies and Applications<br>Author: Douglas Downey, Ph.D Student, University of Washington, Box 352350, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, ddowney@cs.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Susan Dumais, Eric Horvitz<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe the formulation, construction, and evaluation of predictive models of human information seeking from a large dataset of Web search activities. Utilizing machine learning techniques, we construct predictive models and analyze which properties of users, queries, and search sessions are the most predictive of future behavior.  We also discuss applications of the predictive models, focusing on the example of performing principled prefetching of content.
