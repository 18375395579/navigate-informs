Title: Exploring the Role of Cognitive Style on the Efficacy of Causal Mapping to Structuring Problems<br>Author: Luiz Felipe Nasser-Carvalho, Postgraduate Researcher, Warwick University, Warwick University, Teaching Centre M0.06, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom, lfnasser@googlemail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Alberto Franco<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The importance of engaging in problem structuring to reach clear, well articulated problem definitions (PD) has been long recognized. Causal mapping (CM) has been one of the most used approaches to support problem structuring efforts. The study explores the role of Need for Cognition and Need for Closure as moderators of the efficacy of CM to improve PD quality. A mixed-methods approach is used to identify if (path analysis) and how (process tracing) predictors and outcomes relate to each other.
