Title: Applications of Genetic Algorithms to Risk Management and Client Segmentation in Financial Services<br>Author: Russell Walker, President, Walker Bernardo, LLC, 1617 W Grace Street, Richmond, VA, 23220, United States of America, russell@walkerbernardo.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: New data mining techniques enable managers in financial services to exploit large amounts of data.  We demonstrate how our new proprietary, genetic algorithm-based approach, increases the predictive value of models for credit risk management, and in resolving the general customer segmentation dilemma. Applications of such models need not tax the analytical team and can process large amounts of data and consider and identify numerous interaction and non-linear realities in the underlying data.
