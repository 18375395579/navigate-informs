Title: Airline Charter Service for Conference Sports Travel<br>Author: Anne Goodchild, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, 121E More Hall, Box 352700, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, annegood@u.washington.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We model the operations of an air charter service for conference sports in competition with existing scheduled travel options.  The identification of the relevant demand subset and the routing and scheduling of aircraft is done in the same framework.  Through this modeling we develop an innovative method for formulating and accommodating continuous time windows and competitive market dynamics.
