Title: A Decision Analytic Approach to Robust Product Design<br>Author: Robert Bordley, Technical Fellow, General Motors Research, 525 Choice Court, Troy, MI, 48084, United States, robert.bordley@gm.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Robust detailed engineering design generally employs chance-constrained programming(CCP) since designers consider conventional decision analytic assessment techniques inapplicable. Because of the known inconsistency between CCP and decision analysis, this paper uses target-oriented utility theory to develop a decision analytic approach to robust design which is readily applicable to conventional engineering design problems.
