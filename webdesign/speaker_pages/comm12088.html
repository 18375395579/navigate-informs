Moreover, limited budget for nursing positions compels hospital operations managers to efficiently utilize nursing staffs without lose of care quality. We present a decision support model to evaluate the benefit of flexing the nurse staffing levels for different care units and nurse float pool. We further analyze the cost implications of using part-time nurses and float pool nurses.</br>
