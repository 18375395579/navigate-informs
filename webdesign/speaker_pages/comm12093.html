Title: Long-Term Water Allocation Models under Uncertainty<br>Author: Guzin Bayraksan, The Ohio State University, Integrated Systems Engineering, Columbus, OH, United States of America, bayraksan.1@osu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present long-term, multi-period generalized network water allocation models under water demand and supply uncertainty. We discuss different ways to incorporate uncertainty in the model, resulting in different classes of stochastic programs.  We also discuss how these uncertainties can be tied to regional climate models.  We apply our models to allocate Colorado River water to a southeast region of Tucson, Arizona and present computational results.
