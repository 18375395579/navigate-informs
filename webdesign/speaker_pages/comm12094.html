<br>Title: What is the Best Practice for Yardstick Regulation of Electricity Distribution?</br><br>Author: Timo Kuosmanen, Professor, Aalto University School of Economics, PL 21220, Helsinki, Finland, timo.kuosmanen@aalto.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antti Saastamoinen, Timo Sipiläinen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Electricity distribution is a natural local monopoly. Most regulators apply data envelopment analysis (DEA) or stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate efficient cost. In Finland, the regulator adopted StoNED method in 2012. This paper compares DEA, SFA and StoNED using data of electricity distribution. While efficiency scores are highly correlated, the cost targets show major differences. StoNED yields superior precision in Monte Carlo simulations.</br>
