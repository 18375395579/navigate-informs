Title: Optimal Routing of Geometry Cars<br>Author: Juan Morales, Sr. Operations Research Specialist, BNSF Railway, 2400 Western Center Blvd., Fort Worth, TX, 76131, United States of America, Juan.Morales@BNSF.com<br>Coauthor(s): Anant Balakrishnan, Gang Li<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present an application of a modeling approach used to improve the schedules of Geometry Cars (GC). GC are high value assets used to test track conditions. Conditions can deteriorate at different rates on distinct segments and a schedule needs to ensure that the time between consecutive tests of a track does not exceed a given threshold. We present the approach and discuss some of the techniques used to reduce solutions times. We also illustrate its use to challenge a managerial paradigm.
