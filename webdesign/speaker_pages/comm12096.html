Title: Theoretical Errors for Individual Measurements, Motivated by Models of Flu Activity<br>Author: Justin Chimka, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering, Fayetteville, AR, United States, jchimka@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jia Zhou<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider situations in which the sample used for process monitoring consists of an individual unit. Our motivation comes from regression model-based control charts for influenza activity, where individual units are absolute values of residuals assumed to have come from gamma distributions. We have developed probability statements for computing true errors associated with statistical process control of continuously distributed individual measurements.
