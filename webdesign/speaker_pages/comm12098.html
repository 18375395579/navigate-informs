Title: Impact of Deterministic Constraints on New York Flights<br>Author: Shon Grabbe, Doctor, NASA Ames Research Center, Mail Stop: 210-10, Moffett Field, CA, 94035, United States, shon.r.grabbe@nasa.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Dr. Banavar Sridhar, Avijit Mukherjee<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: To reduce the effect of delays on New York flights, strategic, traffic flow management control strategies were calculated from an aircraft-level model using both heuristic and optimization solution methodologies. The results are presented in terms of aggregate- and aircraft-level flight delay, equity, and routing metrics.
