Title: Consumer Price Sensitivities Across Categories<br>Author: Sri Devi Duvvuri, Assistant Professor, Tippie College of Business, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, sri-duvvuri@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Gruca<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A Hierarchical Bayesian factor analytic approach is used to explore how market structure affects the relationships among consumer price sensitivities for categories that are related—substitutes or complements. The factor structure allows estimation of  higher-order factors so complex and managerially important patterns of covariation in price sensitivities can be deduced. The model is empirically tested using scanner panel data.
