The approach uses Monte Carlo sampling and Bayesian, nonlinear particle filtering to estimate the state (schedule) of a terrorist operation, specified as a project management model with uncertain task durations. We perform a set of experiments that evaluate the effectiveness of the estimation given observables of variable quality.</br>
