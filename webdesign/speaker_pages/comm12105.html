Box 1100, TKK, 02015, Finland, pekka.mild@tkk.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Ahti Salo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Resource allocation decisions in road management have far-reaching impacts on asset values and future service levels. We present an award-winning decision model to help senior managers at the Finnish Road Administration allocate limited appropriations among different kinds of road products. The model gives budget ranges for each product for a 30-year period, based on annual deterioration of asset values, use of incomplete preference information, and computation of optimal maintenance portfolios.
