We present an award-winning decision model to help senior managers at the Finnish Road Administration allocate limited appropriations among different kinds of road products. The model gives budget ranges for each product for a 30-year period, based on annual deterioration of asset values, use of incomplete preference information, and computation of optimal maintenance portfolios.</br>
