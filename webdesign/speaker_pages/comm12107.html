<br>Title: Predictive Models for Cardiovascular Disease</br><br>Author: Tsung-Lin Wu, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial & Ssytems Engineering, Center for OR in Medicine & HealthCare, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States, tlwu@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eva K. Lee</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we describe an optimization-based predictive model that allows multi-group classification while constraining the inter-group misclassification rate. A feature selection heuristics will be outlined. Applications to cardiovascular disease data and other real-world dataset are provided to illustrate the power of our model.</br>
