<br>Title: Design of Experiments for Simulation Optimization</br><br>Author: Hong Wan, Assistant Professor, School of IE, Purdue Univ., 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, hwan@purdue.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we will discuss efficient design of experiments for simulation optimization. We have proposed a DOE-based simulation optimization framework that has nice convergence property. Based on the framework, we will discuss different designs that are suitable for simulation optimization.</br>
