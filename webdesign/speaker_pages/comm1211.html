State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States, alok@purdue.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Effect Based Thinking (EBT) provides a complete understanding of the strategic, operational, and tactical issues of an environment viewed as a complex adaptive system. This paper describes the process of creating a synthetic environment for analysis and simulation  (SEAS) that mirror “real world?counterparts in all their key aspects.  By combining millions of artificial agents with a small number of human agents, SEAS captures both detail and strategic interactions.
