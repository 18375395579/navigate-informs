Title: Branching on General Disjunctions<br>Author: Ted Ralphs, Associate Professor, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, ted@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Serdar Yildiz<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The use of general disjunctions for branching has been experimentally shown to decrease the size of the search tree. However, selecting good disjunctions is expensive and can easily lead to slower running times overall. In this talk, we focus on recent experimental work on choosing branching disjunctions heuristically. The methodology exploits the close connection between disjunctions used for branching and those used for cutting.
