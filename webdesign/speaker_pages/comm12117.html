<br>Title: Scalability of Modeling Driver's Behavior under the Extended Belief-desire-intention Framework</br><br>Author: Sojung Kim, The University of Arizona, 1127 E. James E, Rogers Way, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, sojungkim@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Xi, Young-Jun Son</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: While the extended Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework allows us to mimic realistic driver behaviors, it is computational demanding when applied to a large traffic network.  This paper aims at analyzing the relationship between model scalability and network complexity.  By comparing the return of investment of employing different modeling methodologies, we intend to find the scenarios in which the extended BDI framework can achieve high performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</br>
