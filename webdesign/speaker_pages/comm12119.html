Title: Context Aware Nuclear Evaluation System<br>Author: Simon Labov, Physicist, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, P.O. Box 808, L-210, Livermore, CA, 94550, United States, slabov@llnl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Pivovaroff, Kelley Herndon Ford, Milovan Krnjajic, Artur Dubrawski, Josep Roure, Doug Speck, Karl Nelson, Dov Cohen, Saswati Ray, John Ostlund, Karen Chen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: One of the most critical challenges in national security is the detection of a nuclear or radiological weapon in the midst of common radioactive materials.  We are developing a unique approach that combines inputs from multiple radiation sensors with contextual information (e.g. manifest information). Our system uses physics-based techniques to reduce the measurements and contextual information into a series of feature vectors, and machine learning algorithms to classify the incident.
