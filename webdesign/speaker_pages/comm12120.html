Title: Socio-dynamic Discrete Choice on Networks<br>Author: Elenna Dugundji, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Faculty of Social & Behavioral Sciences, Nieuwe Prinsengracht 130, 1018 VZ, Amsterdam, Netherlands, E.R.Dugundji@uva.nl<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A model is considered where a commuter’s transportation mode choice is influenced by his peers' mode share, and which accounts for common unobserved attributes of choice alternatives in the error structure. Non-global interactions are addressed within different network structures, combining advanced econometric estimation with computational techniques from multi-agent based simulation. Effects of sample size, initial conditions, geographic scale and systematic omitted links are explored.
