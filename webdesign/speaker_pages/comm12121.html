<br>Title: A System Architecture for Autonomous Demand Side Load Management in Smart Buildings</br><br>Author: Miguel F. Anjos, Canada Research Chair in Discrete Nonlinear Optimization in Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, C.P. 6079, succ. Centre-ville, Montreal, QC, H3C 3A7, Canada, miguel-f.anjos@polymtl.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Giuseppe T Costanzo, Gilles Savard, Guchuan Zhu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a new system architecture for demand-side load management. The system is composed of modules for admission control, load balancing, and demand/response management that operate using online operation control, optimal scheduling, and dynamic pricing respectively. It can integrate different energy sources and handle autonomous systems with heterogeneous dynamics in multiple time-scales. Simulation results confirm the viability and efficiency of the proposed framework.</br>
