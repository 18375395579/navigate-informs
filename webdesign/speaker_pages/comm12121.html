The system is composed of modules for admission control, load balancing, and demand/response management that operate using online operation control, optimal scheduling, and dynamic pricing respectively. It can integrate different energy sources and handle autonomous systems with heterogeneous dynamics in multiple time-scales. Simulation results confirm the viability and efficiency of the proposed framework.
