This paper discusses analytical and empirical models regarding online bidding. The objective of the analysis is to present a framework for how auctions progress, and to characterize the conditional final price as auctions evolve. Data validation includes analysis of 40,000 bids from 4,000 laptop and desktop auctions from a large PC manufacturer.
