Ilker Birbil, Professor, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Ýstanbul, -, Turkey, sibirbil@sabanciuniv.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ahmet Esat Hizir, Orhan Feyzioglu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Urban transportation produces an enormous loss of time, unhealthy environments for inhabitants and contributes substantially to climate change. To demonstrate a possible application of mathematical programming within sustainable transportation, we present several bilevel optimization models that aim at reduction of the gas emissions through toll pricing and capacity enhancement. We conduct a thorough computational study with the proposed models on a testing network and interpret the results.</br>
