The system uses an innovative combination of the Delphi and Grass roots forecasting methods to estimate advertising demand.  We embedded our algorithm in a work flow system that seamlessly integrates into NBCU's existing sales systems.  Since 2004 over 200 sales and finance personnel at NBCU have been using the system to support sales decisions during the $4.5 billion upfront market.</br>
