<br>Title: Predicting Sequential Health Events</br><br>Author: Benjamin Letham, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Operations Research Center, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, bletham@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Madigan, Cynthia Rudin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Using a database of sequences of health events, we wish to learn a predictor that can use a patient's current medical history to predict future health events. We use ideas from supervised ranking to develop a framework for sequential predictions that allows for a variety of modeling choices. We apply our method to health event data from a clinical trial and demonstrate good performance.</br>
