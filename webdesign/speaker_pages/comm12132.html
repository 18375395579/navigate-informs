A simulation of the model successfully replicates various statistical properties of price returns.     In the second half, I argue that change in market liquidity explains how my order flow model satisfies the weak form of  Efficient Market Hypothesis. A method of quantifying market liquidity from order flow data is introduced to explain this.</br>
