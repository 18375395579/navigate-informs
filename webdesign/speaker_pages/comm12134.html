<br>Title: Identifying Outliers and Monitoring Process Profile  Data</br><br>Author: Hang Zhang, PhD Candidate, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, zhangh@eden.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Susan Albin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new method to identify outliers in a dataset that consists of profiles, that is, functions that characterize a product or process. The method can be used to remove out-of-control profiles in a baseline dataset or for monitoring purposes. We demonstrate the method on simulated and real application data.</br>
