Title: Fire Season Suppression Resource Planning using Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Yu Wei, Associate Professor, Colorado State University, Forest and Rangeland Stewardship, 1472 Campus Delivery, Ft. Collins, CO, 80523-1472, United States of America, wei@cnr.colostate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mike Bevers<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We simulated growth of more than 1,000 historical wildfires for a fire planning unit using hourly fire weather data. Simulation results provided spatially realistic fire perimeter and area parameters for scenarios in an otherwise aspatial multistage stochastic integer programming fire containment model.  Model solutions suggest optimal fire suppression resource stationing and dispatch decisions for a fire season.  Results of an initial test case are reported for the Black Hills of South Dakota.
