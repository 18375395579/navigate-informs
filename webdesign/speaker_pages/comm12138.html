Title: A Context Tree Method for Multistage Fault Detection and Isolation<br>Author: Pierre Brice, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, MGI548@motorola.com<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Jiang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a generic system model based on context trees to predict system behaviors for the purpose of fault detection and isolation in a multistage software system. The approach consists of learning multistage model structures by capturing the expected statistical distribution of input/output at different stages and detecting departures from the expected model structures.
