Utility analysis, modeling and simulation, and game theory were applied by individual manages in there decision analysis with varied success. Results indicate that when smaller managers make changes there is little effect on the environment, whereas when larger manages make changes, the environment is changed, thus requiring updating of the managers?probability beliefs.
