Title: Contingency-based Zonal Reserve Modeling and Pricing in a Co-optimized Energy and Reserve Market<br>Author: Tongxin Zheng, Technical Manager, ISO New England, 1 Sullivan Road, Holyoke, MA, 01106, United States of America, tzheng@iso-ne.com<br>Coauthor(s): Eugene Litvinov<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper presents the market clearing framework for the co-optimized real-time energy-reserve market implemented in the ISO New England. In this co-optimized market clearing model, reserve products are procured on a zonal basis based on system and local contingency protection criteria. The zonal reserve model is derived from the worst contingency event in the reserve zone and ensures reserve deliverability among reserve zones.
