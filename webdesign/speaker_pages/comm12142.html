Title: Bayesian Inference for Rating Transition Models<br>Author: Catalina Stefanescu, Assistant Professor of Decision Sciences, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, CStefanescu@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Radu Tunaru, Stuart Turnbull<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate stochastic models for rating transitions and propose a Bayesian framework for calibrating these models using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The methodology is applied to the analysis of a recent data set of global corporate defaults and rating transitions from Standard and Poor’s, covering the period 1981 to 2004.
