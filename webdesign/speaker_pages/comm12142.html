<br>Title: Bayesian Inference for Rating Transition Models</br><br>Author: Catalina Stefanescu, Assistant Professor of Decision Sciences, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, CStefanescu@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Radu Tunaru, Stuart Turnbull</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We investigate stochastic models for rating transitions and propose a Bayesian framework for calibrating these models using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The methodology is applied to the analysis of a recent data set of global corporate defaults and rating transitions from Standard and Poor’s, covering the period 1981 to 2004.</br>
