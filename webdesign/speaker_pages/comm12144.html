Title: A Hyper-exponential Jump-diffusion Model<br>Author: Steven Kou, Columbia University, 312 Mudd Building, Dept. of IEOR, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States, sk75@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ning Cai<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We provide analytical solutions to path-dependent options, including lookback, quantile, and American options, under a hyper-exponential jump-diffusion model, which includes the double exponential jump-diffusion model as a special case. The analytical solutions are made possible by using matrix algebra and integro-differential equations.
