It distinguishes between incoming and outgoing quality problems by establishing a relationship between input and output measurements. In practice, the model relating the input and output must first be estimated before the CSC is implemented. This paper investigates the effect of parameter estimation errors on the performance of CSCs and presents some useful results.</br>
