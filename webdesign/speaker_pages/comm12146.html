Title: A New Mechanism for Service Level Expectation Setting in Air Traffic Management<br>Author: Michael Ball, Professor, University of Maryland, Robert H Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, mball@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A research team with participation from MIT, UC Berkeley and the University of Maryland has developed a new mechanism for generating a airline-consensus strategic plan for guiding air traffic management on a given day of operations. The output takes the form of a multi-dimensional service level expectation vector.  The underlying models and analysis employ voting theory, performance estimation, integer and linear programming and game theory.
