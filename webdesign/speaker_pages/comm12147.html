<br>Title: Data-driven Models for Robust Aircraft Routing</br><br>Author: Lavanya Marla, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Avenue, 216E, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, lavanyam@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Barnhart, Vikrant Vaze</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this work, we investigate the types of delay distributions that aircraft incur as they travel on their routes. From an extensive data set, we discuss our empirical findings about distributions of delays propagating on possible aircraft routes or paths. We further discuss the reasons for such delay patterns. We conclude with models and frameworks that can capture such patterns effectively and produce solutions that mitigate these delays.</br>
