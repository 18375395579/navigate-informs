Title: Best Publication in Environment/Sustainability: Basin-wide Cooperative Water Resources Allocation<br>Author: Lizhong Wang, George_Wang@golder.com<br>Coauthor(s): Liping Fang, Keith Hipel<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Cooperative Water Allocation Model (CWAM) is designed within a general mathematical programming framework for modeling equitable and efficient water allocation among competing users at the basin level taking into account hydrologic, economic and environmental interrelationships. In this methodology, water is allocated in two steps: the initial allocation of water rights and subsequent reallocation of water and associated net benefits by utilizing cooperative game theoretic approaches.
