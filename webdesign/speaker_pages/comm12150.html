Title: Modeling Metabolism: Optimal Flux Patterns and Epistatic Interactions<br>Author: Eivind Almaas, Microbial Systems Biology Group, Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab, 7000 East Ave, L-452, Livermore, CA, 94550, United States, almaas2@llnl.gov<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Using the linear and quadratic programming framework of constraint-based flux analysis, we investigate the interplay between metabolic network structure and optimal flux patterns. Recently, we determined a novel type of epistatic gene-gene interaction, as mediated by the metabolic network: Counter to intuition, an organism’s fitness can improve through gene knockouts, i.e. inflicting damage on the metabolic network. The origin of this effect, as well as several examples, will be discussed.
