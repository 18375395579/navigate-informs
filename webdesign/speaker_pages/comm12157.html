Electricity prices are  set at the fuel cost of the last operating unit when there is no curtailment, and at some regulated price cap when there is curtailment. The equilibrium model is stochastic  We model risk aversion of the agents through a CVaR of the net margin of the industry. The CVaR induces a risk neutral probability according to which investors value their plants.
