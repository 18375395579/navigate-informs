Title: Value of Reverse Factoring in Multi-stage Supply Chains<br>Author: Hande Cetinay, Technische Universiteit, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands, h.cetinay@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Reindorp, Jan Fransoo, Fehmi Tanrisever<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a mathematical model for integration, analysis, and optimization of operational and financial processes within a supply chain. Specifically, we consider commercial transactions of a large corporate with a small supplier. We show how application of reverse factoring influences the operational and financial decisions of these firms. While some empirical work on reverse factoring exists within research literature, our model constitutes the first analytic treatment of the problem.
