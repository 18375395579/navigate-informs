Title: Multi-agent Based Knowledge Discovery in a Distributed Environment - a Concurrent Logic Approach<br>Author: Zhangxi Lin, Associate Professor, Texas Tech University, CAABI Research Center, Lubbock, TX, 79416, United States of America, ZHANGXI.LIN@ttu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to knowledge discovery in a distributed eBusiness system using multi-agent techniques. Guided by the needs from local knowledge base reasoning, each agent can autonomously initiate the sessions with others to acquire the mostly wanted information in order to reach its data analytic objectives. The case-based reasoning and multi-value logic methods are employed. The approach has the potential to be applied to anti money laundering.
