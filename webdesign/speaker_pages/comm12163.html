Title: Revisiting Dynamic Transit Assignment<br>Author: Mark Hickman, Associate Professor, University of Arizona, P.O. Box 210072, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States, mhickman@engr.arizona.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Recent research on dynamic transit assignment has suggested models that could be quite different than existing static transit assignment methods.  We investigate a dynamic, strategy-based model for transit assignment.  This model describes both sequential passenger behavior at a stop as well as sequential behavior through the transit network. Characteristics of this model are discussed and are compared with existing assignment models.
