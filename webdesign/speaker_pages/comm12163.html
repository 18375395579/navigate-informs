Box 210072, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States, mhickman@engr.arizona.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Recent research on dynamic transit assignment has suggested models that could be quite different than existing static transit assignment methods.  We investigate a dynamic, strategy-based model for transit assignment.  This model describes both sequential passenger behavior at a stop as well as sequential behavior through the transit network. Characteristics of this model are discussed and are compared with existing assignment models.</br>
