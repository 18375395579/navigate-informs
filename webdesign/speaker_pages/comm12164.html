Title: Competing Investment Strategies with Fixed Costs and Uncertainty<br>Author: Shu-Jung Sunny Yang, University of Melbourne, Parkville Victoria 3010, Australia, sj.sunny.yang@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Eddie Anderson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a new model of strategic investment to explore investment-timing trade-offs. Our model incorporates two distinctive elements compared with conventional output-setting games. First we allow firms to announce and commit to a generic investment strategy in advance. Second we include a fixed cost for investment. By applying the proposed modeling framework to a symmetric-duopoly capital-intensive industry, we find that a symmetric preemptive equilibrium is the most likely outcome.
