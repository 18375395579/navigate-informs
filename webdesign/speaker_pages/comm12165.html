Title: A Comprehensive Probabilistic Framework for Prediction of Patients' Readmission to Medial Centers<br>Author: Adel Alaeddini, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America, Adel.Alaeddini@utsa.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The problem of readmission to medical centers after getting discharge often causes serious problems to both patients and medical centers. In this study we develop a comprehensive probabilistic framework based on integration of Survival Models, Bayesian Inference, and Local Regression Analysis to provide an accurate real-time estimate of readmission, personalized for each patient. We also design a comprehensive optimization model to find the optimal parameters of the propose framework.
