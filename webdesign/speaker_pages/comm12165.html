In this study we develop a comprehensive probabilistic framework based on integration of Survival Models, Bayesian Inference, and Local Regression Analysis to provide an accurate real-time estimate of readmission, personalized for each patient. We also design a comprehensive optimization model to find the optimal parameters of the propose framework.</br>
