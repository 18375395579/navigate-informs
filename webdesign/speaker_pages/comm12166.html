We focus on the estimates of landing time intervals (LTIs) for each consecutive pair of aircraft for each runway and then aggregate micro aircraft-landing data to runway level, airport-configuration level and airport level for five major airports in the U.S. We discus the advantages of disaggregate airport capacity modeling.</br>
