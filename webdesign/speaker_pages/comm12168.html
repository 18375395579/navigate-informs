Emphasis on analysis; modeling and experimentation are methods to support analysis, analysis does not always require modeling or experimentation in order to yield important insights.  2.  Emphasis on gaining insights, primarily through appreciating uncertainty and complexity; not determining precise answers but improving understanding.  3.  Emphasis on applying analysis to gaining insights regarding impacts to the most relevant outcomes.</br>
