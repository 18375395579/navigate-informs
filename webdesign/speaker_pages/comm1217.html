<br>Title: Option Market Making under Inventory Risk</br><br>Author: Mehmet Saglam, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway 4O, New York, United States of America, ms444@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sasha Stoikov</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a mean-variance framework to analyze the optimal quoting policy of an option market maker. We present two models consistent with our framework. The first one focuses on Delta risk. Since the stock is more liquid than the option, the market maker moves the stock quotes more aggressively than the option quotes. The second model focuses on Vega and Gamma risks. In this setting, the market maker moves the option quotes by an amount proportional to the net Vega and Gamma.</br>
