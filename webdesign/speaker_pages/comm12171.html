Title: Integrating Medical Decision Rules into a Simulation Model of Pre-hospital Medical Disaster Response<br>Author: Filip Van Utterbeeck, Royal Military Academy, Renaissancelaan 30, Brussels, 1000, Belgium, filip.van.utterbeeck@rma.ac.be<br>Coauthor(s): Christophe Ullrich<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We generate realistic victim profiles for medical disaster simulations based on medical expertise. We apply these profiles in a medical disaster model where victim entities evolve in parallel through a medical response model and a victim pathway model. The medical response model focuses on the pre-hospital phase which includes triage procedures, evacuation processes and medical processes. Medical decisions such as whether to evacuate or to treat the current victim are based on its RPM score.
