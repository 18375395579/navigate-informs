Title: Patient Rule Induction Method for Optimizing Multistage Manufacturing Processes<br>Author: Doh-Soon Kwak, Doctoral Student, Pohang University of Science and Technology, San 31, Hyoja-dong, Nam-gu, Pohang, 790-784, Korea, Republic of, poskit@postech.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Kwang-Jae Kim, Myeong-Soo Lee<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Most of work in multistage manufacturing process optimization assume that data have been collected and suitable models have been built. However, a good model is not easy to obtain from operational data. This paper proposes an extension of the patient rule induction method as an alternative approach to optimizing multistage manufacturing processes. The performance and properties of the proposed method are discussed using a simulation study.
