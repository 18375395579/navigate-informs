Title: Derivative-free Optimization Enhanced-surrogate Model Development for Optimization<br>Author: Nick Sahinidis, Swearingen Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Chemical Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, sahinidis@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alison Cozad, David Miller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a model generation method that uses derivative-based and derivative-free optimization alongside machine learning and statistical techniques to learn algebraic models of detailed simulations. Once a candidate set of models is defined, they are tested, exploited, and improved through the use of derivative-free solvers to adaptively sample new points. We provide extensive computational experience with ALAMO, a code that we have developed to implement this strategy.
