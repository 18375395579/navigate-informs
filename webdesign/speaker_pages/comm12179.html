<br>Title: A Symbolic Model Specification for Energy Efficiency Models</br><br>Author: Emilio L. Cano, University Rey Juan Carlos, Camino del Molino s/n, Edificio Biblioteca D007, Fuenlabrada, 28943, Spain, emilio.lopez@urjc.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Javier M. Moguerza</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Within the framework of a Decision Support System for energy-efficient buildings, the dynamic generation of optimization models is advisable. The aim is to allow reproducibility and scalability, in order to cover a wide range of building configurations. In this work, an integrated model specification framework is presented. Within this scheme data structures comprising the model objects, and mathematical and digital representations are generated for both, human and machine interpretation.</br>
