Title: Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) Enhancement Methodology Using Situational Parameter Adjustments<br>Author: Sharif Melouk, Assistant Professor of Operations Research, Air Force Institute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way, Building 641, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-7765, United States, sharif.melouk@afit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marcus Perry, Michael Carras<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In the context of close ground combat, the perception of BDA is closely linked with a soldier's engagement decisions and has significant effects on the battlefield.  This research examines the BDA process from a perception standpoint and proposes a methodology to collect pertinent data and model this perception.  We propose a SME survey design and a method to model the BDA process as a discrete time Markov chain with Bayesian inference used to update probability distributions at each time step.
