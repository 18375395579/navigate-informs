Title: Inverse Principal-Agent Paradigm: Application to Health Care Delivery<br>Author: Donald Lee, Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect St, Box 208200, New Haven, CT, United States of America, dkklee@cantab.net<br>Coauthor(s): Stefanos Zenios<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: How should dialysis providers be paid for patient outcomes along multiple dimensions? Principal-agent models can in theory be used to construct a pay-for-performance system for Medicare’s dialysis program, but little is known about the underlying model parameters. We develop a procedure for inferring the provider's cost parameters from its past outcomes, making it possible to implement the optimal payment system. Numerical results will be presented.
