Title: Adversarial Risk Analysis for Counterterrorism Modelling<br>Author: Jesus Rios, IBM, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, jriosal@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): David Rios Insua<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Recent interest in resource allocation against terrorist threats has inspired the development of methods of analysis for when risks stem from the intentional actions of intelligent adversaries. Most of these approaches have a game theoretic or decision analytic flavor. I provide a critical overview of these approaches and present a new framework of analysis emphasizing how to coherently assess a predictive model on the adversary’s actions, in a context of supporting a defender vs. an attacker.
