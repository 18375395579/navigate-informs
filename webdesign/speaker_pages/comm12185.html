Title: Benefit Assessment for Setting Consensus Service Level Expectations in the National Airspace System<br>Author: Chiwei Yan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 1-245, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, chiwei@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Barnhart, Vikrant Vaze<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We design a consensus-based mechanism to inform the design of traffic management initiatives. Given various Federal Aviation Administration strategies implemented to manage congestion, we develop an integrated recovery model and algorithm to capture airline preferences with respect to inherent operational trade-offs (such as capacity, predictability, etc.). Using case studies derived from real-world data, we evaluate our mechanism and quantify the potential benefits to multiple stakeholders.
