Title: Default Prediction Model using SVM with EDF<br>Author: Woojin Chang, Assistant Professor, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, changw@snu.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Yong Sik Kim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose an default prediction model employing support vector machine (SVM) and Expected default frequency from KMV model, and estimate the default probabilities of Korean manufacturing companies. The sensitivity analysis and a corresponding visualization tool confirm that the solvent and insolvent firms are well classified by our SVM model using EDF.
