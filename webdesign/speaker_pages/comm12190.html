Title: Option Pricing under a Hyper-Exponential Jump Diffusion Model<br>Author: Ning Cai, Department of IEOR, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, nc2118@columbia.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend the analytical tractability of the Black-Scholes model to alternative models with jumps, no matter whether the jump sizes have exponential-type tails or power-type tails. More precisely, we study a jump difusion model for asset prices whose jump sizes are hyper-exponentially distributed. The hyper-exponential distribution can approximate most heavy-tail distributions as closely as possible, including both power- and exponential-type distributions. We demonstrate the hyper-exponential jump difusion model can lead to analytical solutions for popular path-dependent options such as lookback, barrier and perpetual American options. Numerical examples indicate that the formulae are easy to implement and accurate. These analytical solutions are made possible mainly because we solve several high-order integro-differential equations explicitly related to first passage time problems and optimal stopping problems.
