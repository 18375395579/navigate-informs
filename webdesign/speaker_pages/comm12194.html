Title: Estimating Short-Term Path Travel Time Reliability using Decentralized Vehicle-to-Vehicle Information System<br>Author: Shubham Agrawal, Purdue University, NEXTRANS Center, 3000 Kent Avenue, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, shubham@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta, Xiaozheng He<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study proposes a statistical model to estimate short-term path travel time reliability using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication data.  Most existing studies rely on assumptions on link travel time distribution to infer path travel time reliability using data from point sources such as detectors. The proposed model employs observed low-latency data from V2V to circumvent this limitation.
