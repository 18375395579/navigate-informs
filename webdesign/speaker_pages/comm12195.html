Title: Synthesis of Heat Exchanger Networks with Phase Changes<br>Author: Iftekhar Karimi, Professor, National University of Singapore, Department of Chem & Biomolecular Eng, 4 Engineering Drive 4, Singapore, Singapore, cheiak@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): M M Faruque Hasan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We extend the heat exchanger network synthesis (HENS) to include multi-component phase changes. We model the temperature-enthalpy relation using an empirical correlation especially for the nonlinear 2-phase region and extend the superstructure concept to the level of each exchanger to model phase changes for mixtures.
