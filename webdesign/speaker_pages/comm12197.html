Title: Multicommodity Variable Upper Bound Flow Models<br>Author: Deon Burchett, PhD Student, University of Florida, 406-A Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, deonlb@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Variable upper bound flow models are well studied in the mixed-integer programming literature, and their study has yielded inequalities that are useful in computation. We consider a multi-commodity generalization of variable upper bound flow models. We perform a polyhedral study of this extended model, investigating novel aspects of its structure while also examining its relationship to the single-commodity case.
