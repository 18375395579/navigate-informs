<br>Title: Optimal Bayesian and Sequential Experimental Design using Approximate Dynamic Programming</br><br>Author: Xun Huan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, 37-442, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, xunhuan@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Youssef Marzouk</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: How can one select a sequence of experiments to maximize the value of costly experimental data? We formulate this optimal sequential experimental design problem in a POMDP framework, maximizing the expected information gain. Two major numerical issues are addressed: the representation of posterior distributions in a sequential Bayesian inference context, and the choice of features in value function approximation for ADP. Preliminary results are demonstrated on model problems and applications.</br>
