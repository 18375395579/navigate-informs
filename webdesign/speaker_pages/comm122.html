Its clinical management follows complex care pathway that is difficult to evaluate without a comprehensive clinical DSS. We are developing the MET-A3Support-Asthma clinical DSS using a multi-agent framework. This talk describes two agents: a triage agent for early assessment of asthma severity and an evidence-based agent for retrieval of patient-specific evidence from an on-line repository.</br>
