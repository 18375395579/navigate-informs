Title: Practical Design of Generalized Likelihood Ratio Control Charts for Autocorrelated Data<br>Author: Giovanna Capizzi, Associate Professor, Department of Statistical Sciences - University of Padua, via Cesare Battisti 241/243, Padua, PD, 35121, Italy, capizzi@stat.unipd.it<br>Coauthor(s): Guido Masarotto<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a practical approach to the implementation of  Generalized Likelihood Ratio control charts for monitoring an autoregressive and moving average process when only a Phase I sample is available. The approach, based on automatic identification, estimates the control limits via stochastic approximation using bootstrap resampling. Thus, it is able to take into account the uncertainty about the underlying model even when only a few Phase I observations are available.
