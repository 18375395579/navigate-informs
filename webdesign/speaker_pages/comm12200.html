<br>Title: Dynamic Bayes Network Approach to Market Basket Analysis</br><br>Author: Bumsoo Kim, PhD Candidate, George Washington University, 2201 G Street NW, Funger Hall #415H, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, bk4498@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Prasad, Refik Soyer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we consider utilizing DBN’s to model different market basket problems. The proposed approach can be used for learning and inference objectives, for both model parameters of a given structure and the dynamics of the structure itself. We use MCMC methods and use results from the DBN literature to devise learning algorithms in a time-series market basket data setting. We illustrate the implementation of proposed approach with low-dimensional problems and discuss their applications.</br>
