Burns, Robert Haight</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a new population protection function for reserve site selection models that determines whether minimum habitat requirements are present in a given reserve network.  We embedding the function in an integer programming-based reserve selection model and apply it to a case study of Myotis bat conservation on Lopez Island, United States. Finally, we highlight the need in future reserve design models to capture intra- and inter-species competition for habitat resources.</br>
