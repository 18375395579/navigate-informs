<br>Title: Dirichlet Compound Multinomial (DCM) Models in Text Analytics and Search</br><br>Author: Ram Akella, UC Santa Cruz, 1848 Emerson St., Palo Alto, CA, 94301, United States of America, akella@soe.ucsc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zuobing Xu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We describe a text-analytics problem occurring in CRM, search engines, and service center support, based on our work with Cisco. We discuss our novel use of DCM models in place of traditional multinomial models. We demonstrate significant improvement in search efficiency with enterprise-level-data and discuss the underlying analytic reasons.</br>
