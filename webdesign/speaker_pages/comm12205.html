Title: A Simulation-optimization Approach for Scheduling Outpatient Chemotherapy Appointments<br>Author: Michelle Alvarado, Ph.D. Student, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, alvarado.michelle.m@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Tanisha Cotton, Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a simulation-optimization methodology for scheduling chemotherapy appointments with uncertain appointment lengths, acuity levels, and resource availability. We formulate a stochastic integer programming (SIP) model to schedule resources for a patient’s treatment regimen. A simulation model emulates the oncology clinic operations and uses the performance measures to update the SIP model decisions. The proposed methodology is evaluated using patient data from a Texas oncology clinic.
