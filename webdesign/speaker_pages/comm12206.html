Title: Robust Behavior-Consistent Traffic Routing Under Information Provision<br>Author: Alexander Paz, apaz@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A fuzzy control framework is used to determine behavior-consistent traffic routing strategies based on the estimation of driver behavior. H-infinity filtering is used to optimize controller parameters and achieve greater computational efficiency. Significant differences in terms of total system travel time can be obtained when the behavior-consistent approach is compared to traditional assignment approaches.
