<br>Title: Choice-Based Revenue Management: An Empirical Study of Estimation and Optimization</br><br>Author: Gustavo Vulcano, Assistant Professor, New York University, 44 West 4th Street, Suite 8-76, New York, NY, 10012, United States, gvulcano@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the demand estimation problem faced by an airline flying an origin--destination market, accounting for customer choice behavior. We developed an statistical estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation. Modifications to account for unobservable data were developed using a variation of the expectation maximization method. The procedure was tested over data provided by a major commercial U.S. airline, showing promising results.</br>
