<br>Title: Approximation of Bilevel Generation Capacity Investment Equilibria</br><br>Author: Sonja Wogrin, IIT, Comillas Pontifical University, Madrid, Spain, sonja.wogrin@iit.upcomillas.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Efraim Centeno</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new methodology to approximate bilevel generation capacity equilibria using only single-level capacity equilibrium models and apply this approximation scheme to generation expansion planning in liberalized electricity markets. With the proposed approximation scheme, we are able to solve the bilevel model reasonably well by smartly employing single-level models which reduces the computational time by two orders of magnitude.</br>
