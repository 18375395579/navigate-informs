Title: Transfer Payments in Global Climate Policy<br>Author: Florian Landis, ZEW Mannheim, L7, 1, Mannheim, 68161, Germany, landis@zew.de<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Bernauer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We combine global climate modeling with regional welfare analysis to estimate regional carbon prices under various climate change, emissions and economic scenarios. Differences in regional carbon prices motivate transfer payments, if a global carbon price was to emerge. Results indicate that distributional matters can be discussed using arguments of cost-benefit analysis and we highlight to what extent the different uncertainties inherent to the analysis affect estimates of transfer payments.
