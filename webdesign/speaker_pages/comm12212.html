<br>Title: Integer Programming Models of Pricing Problems with Probabilisitic Choice</br><br>Author: Romy Shioda, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue, Waterloo, ON, Canada, rshioda@math.uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tuncel Levent</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present mixed-integer programming formulations of several product pricing models using probabilistic customer choice models.  In these models, the probability that a customer segment would purchase a given product depends on their reservation prices and the product prices.  We present some mathematical properties of these problems and computational experiments.</br>
