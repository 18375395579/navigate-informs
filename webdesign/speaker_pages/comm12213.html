Title: A Degradation Model of Solar Panel Efficiency under Dynamic Conditions<br>Author: Xiao Liu, Research Staff Member, IBM Research Collaboratory Singapore, 9 CBP 1, The IBM Place, Singapore, 486048, Singapore, liuxiao@sg.ibm.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Based on real experimental data, a statistical degradation model is developed for solar panel efficiency at dynamic environmental conditions. We also compare our model to conventional degradation models without considering the environmental conditions.
