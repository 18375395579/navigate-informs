Title: Data Mining, Modeling, and Forecasting for Healthcare<br>Author: Kwok-Leung Tsui, Professor, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States, ktsui@isye.gatech.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk we will discuss data mining, modeling, and forecasting methods in healthcare applications. First we will illustrate data mining methods with patient arrival, waiting time, and operation flow data. Second we will explain exponential smoothing methods for patient arrival forecasting. Finally, we will address the challenges of spatial temporal modeling of health care problems.
