<br>Title: A Hybrid Simulation Methodology to Simulate Financial Risks</br><br>Author: Jack Yang, Senior Research Statistician, SAS Institute, Inc, 100 SAS Campus Dr, Cary, NC, United States of America, Jack.Yang@sas.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper introduces a simulation method that allows a combination of different simulation techniques in one simulation.It is especially suitable for a large financial system where each sub-group of risk factors can be simulated by using different data source and special modeling methods. The hybrid simulation technique accommodates all sub-models into a system and use copula to support the correlation structure.</br>
