<br>Title: Improving the Public Distribution of Essential Medicines in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Case of Zambia</br><br>Author: Zachary Leung, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA, United States of America, zacleung@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeremie Gallien, Prashant Yadav</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Despite remarkable and successful improvements efforts by the government and its partners, the current public distribution system of essential medical drugs in Zambia still results in low availability to patients relative to private sector standards. We present an alternative design involving mobile devices and optimization and evaluate this proposal via a simulation model built with field data. Our results suggest that this proposal would improve drug availability and reduce inventory costs.</br>
