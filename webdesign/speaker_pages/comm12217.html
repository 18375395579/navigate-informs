Title: Evolutionary Optimization with Controlled Random Search<br>Author: Jiaqiao Hu, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Dept. of Applied Math and Stat., Stony Brook, NY, 11794, United States of America, jqhu@ams.sunysb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Marcus, Michael Fu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider an optimization technique, where a population of probabilistic models are maintained at each iteration.  The key question in the proposed approach is how to distribute a given sampling budget among different models. We formulate this problem as an MDP model and derive an optimal sampling scheme. The sampling scheme is then further used to update the current population to produce improving models. Numerical studies are carried out to illustrate the method.
