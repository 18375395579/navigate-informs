The models produce accurate assessments of performance but are time-consuming to construct and execute.  We present a metamodel that provides fast and reasonably accurate estimates of the AMHS response time to move requests. The metamodel is based on a new reliable simulation mechanism that takes essential simulation parameters as intervals to incorporate uncertainties associated with dependency relationships.</br>
