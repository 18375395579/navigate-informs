Title: Improving Schedule Design Through A Priori Evaluation of Robustness and Reliability<br>Author: John-Paul Clarke, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Aerospace Engineering, 270 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, john-paul.clarke@ae.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Terran Melconian<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Schedule reliability is a concern for all airlines. However, there are few tools to evaluate schedule robustness and reliability a priori.  We describe such a tool and illustrate through various examples how MEANS can be used to evaluate schedule robustness and reliability, and thereby improve schedule design.
