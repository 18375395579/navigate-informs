<br>Title: Prediction of Weather Related Center Delays</br><br>Author: Avijit Mukherjee, Associate Research Scientist, University of California Santa Cruz, NASA Ames Research Center, Mail Stop 210-8, Moffett Field, CA, 94035, United States of America, avijit@ucsc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Deepak Kulkarni, Dr. Banavar Sridhar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this study,  the methodology used for estimating the delay at the national level was extended to estimate delays caused by a center  and delays experienced by a center.  It was found that delays caused by a center  can be predicted using that center’s WITI whereas delays experienced by a center are best predicted using WITI of that center and that of a few prominent centers. Futhermore, there is differential impact of weather of different centers on center delays.</br>
