However, many children with PALF will recover: these patients are not benefited by transplantation. Therefore, the decision to list a child for transplantation represents a complex optimal timing question. We present the development and early results of a physiologically based individual microsimulation model of PALF that can be used to evaluate different transplantation decisions.</br>
