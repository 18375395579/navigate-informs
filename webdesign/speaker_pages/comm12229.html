<br>Title: Unfixed Clusterwise Linear Regression</br><br>Author: Haibing Lu, Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA, 95050, United States of America, hlu@scu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Clusterwise linear regression (CLR) considers data points are generated by multiple linear models. Most CLR approaches simply assume that multiple linear models to be discovered have the same explanatory variables and differ only in coefficients. However, it is often the case that different clusters have different exploratory variable sets. How to effectively and efficiently identify  clusters with their respective explanatory variable sets from large scale observations is our interest.</br>
