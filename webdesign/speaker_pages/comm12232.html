Title: Decomposition and Compression of Multivariate Data Using Diffusion Wavelets<br>Author: Poornima Balakrishna, Doctoral Student, Systems Engineering and Operations Research, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States, pbalakri@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rajesh Ganesan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk will present the steps to perform wavelet decomposition of multivariate data. We also present a strategy where the methodology can be applied to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in reinforcement learning approaches via function approximation.
