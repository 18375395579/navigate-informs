<br>Title: Decomposition and Compression of Multivariate Data Using Diffusion Wavelets</br><br>Author: Poornima Balakrishna, Doctoral Student, Systems Engineering and Operations Research, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States, pbalakri@gmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rajesh Ganesan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This talk will present the steps to perform wavelet decomposition of multivariate data. We also present a strategy where the methodology can be applied to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in reinforcement learning approaches via function approximation.</br>
