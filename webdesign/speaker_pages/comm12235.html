Title: Preventive Maintenance Based on Residual-Life Distribution Updates<br>Author: Lisa Maillart, Assistant Professor, University of Pittsburgh, lisa.maillart@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nagi Gebraeel<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Recent developments in condition-monitoring, the process of collecting sensor data to gauge the health of a system more accurately than what results from a priori knowledge alone, include Bayesian procedures for updating the residual life distribution of a system in real time. We present a cost-rate minimizing optimal-stopping decision model to determine, after each residual life distribution update, whether to perform preventive maintenance or to continue to the next observation time.
