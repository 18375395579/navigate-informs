Title: Developing Interactive Tutorials to Support the Teaching of Spreadsheet Modeling Skills<br>Author: Linda Leon, Associate Professor, Loyola Marymount University, One LMU Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90045, United States, lleon@lmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kala Seal, Zbigniew Przasnyski<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: McCarthy's 4MAT model shows active experimentation to be a large part of learning for all types of learners.  We use 4MAT as the theoretical underpinning to develop, and field test, interactive tutorials using current screen capture software to support the teaching of spreadsheet modeling in OR/MS. Individual faculty can now design and create such support modules in a reasonable amount of time. We discuss implementation issues, benefits and limitations of this approach.
