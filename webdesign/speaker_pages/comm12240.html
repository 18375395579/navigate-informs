Title: Time-dependent Modeling via Additive Subordinators<br>Author: Rafael Mendoza-Arriaga, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Austin, IROM, CBA 5.202, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Rafael.Mendoza-Arriaga@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lingfei Li<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We characterize Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes time-changed with additive subordinators as time-inhomogeneous Markov semimartigales, based on which a new class of commodity derivative models is developed. Analytical solutions are obtained for European and Bermudan futures options via eigenfunction expansions, with American option prices computed efficiently via extrapolation.
