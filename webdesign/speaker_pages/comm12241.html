Title: Models for Service Times in Call Centers<br>Author: Rouba Ibrahim, University College London, Gower Street, London, United Kingdom, rouba.ibrahim@ucl.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Pierre L'Ecuyer, Nazim Regnard, Han Ye<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider different models for service times in telephone call centers. We evaluate the goodness of fit of our models and their predictive accuracy by describing results from an empirical study analyzing real-life call center data. Our study shows the importance of accounting for agent heterogeneity and correlations between successive service times when predicting future mean service times in the system.
