Title: Choice of Best-fitting Inputs in Mutli-target Model Calibration: Implications for Economic Analysis<br>Author: Lauren Cipriano, Assistant Professor, Western University, Ivey Business School, London, ON, Canada, lcipriano@ivey.uwo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Eva Enns, C. Torrey Simons, Chung Yin Kong<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We describe a new approach for selecting best-fitting sets from a multi-target model calibration effort which applies the principles of Pareto-optimality.  We demonstrate the new approach using a simple model, developed for illustrative purposes, and a previously-published model used for a cost-effectiveness analysis of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).   We explore the implications of how best-fitting sets are selected on which policy is preferred and decision uncertainty.
