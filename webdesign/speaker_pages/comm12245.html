Title: Multi-Attribute Choice with Ordinal Information: A Comparison of Different Decision Rules<br>Author: Paula Santos, Escola Superior de Tecnologia de Viseu, Departamento de Matemática, ESTV, Campus Politécnico de Viseu, Viseu, 3504-510, Portugal, psarabando@mat.estv.ipv.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Luis Dias<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In the context of additive multi-attribute aggregation, we consider problems with ordinal information, namely considering a ranking of the scaling coefficients and a ranking of the value of each alternative on each criterion. Monte-Carlo simulation was used to compare how different choice rules compare, aiming also to provide guidelines about how to use these rules. The compared rules include ROC weights, minimum value, maximum loss of value, quasi-dominance and quasi-optimality.
