The geometric requirement for the wafer surface is smooth and flat; the thickness is expected to fall within certain specification limits. To achieve the requirement through control, we build a Gaussian-Kriging model, considering the spatial correlation of observations on the wafer, to link the wafer quality with the process variable, and then develop a new run-to-run controller to generate the optimal recipe.</br>
