<br>Title: “Cloud Manufacturing??Distributed Caching on the Semiconductor Manufacturing Floor</br><br>Author: Patrick N Bless, Dr., Intel Corp., 5000 W. Chandler Blvd. Chandler, CH5-255, Phoenix, AZ, 85048, United States of America, pbless@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing equipment relies on large amounts of complex input data including recipes, test programs, and lot information. This data needs to be routed in real-time to process equipment on the floor to avoid idle time/utilization loss. Instead of isolating the equipment from each other via a centralized database system the author has developed a distributed, peer-aware in-memory data store designed to optimize data delivery rates while providing virtually unlimited scalability.</br>
