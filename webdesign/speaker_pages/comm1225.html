These models covered all of the forms that had appeared in the literature prior to 1991. Since that time much of the work has been concentrated on the refinement of these four model forms. In this paper we present a unifying approach and show that all four models can be formulated as special cases of this unifying model. Computational experience is provided for this general problem and future research is proposed.</br>
