Title: Motivating User Contributions to Online Communities: A Structural Hidden Markov Model<br>Author: Wei Chen, University of California-San Diego, Rady School of Management, San Diego, CA, United States of America, Wei.Chen@rady.ucsd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiahua Wei, Kevin Zhu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study develops a structural hidden Markov model (HMM) to understand user contributions to online communities.  Using a public goods framework, our structural HMM model characterizes the dynamics of user contributions and investigates the effectiveness of different motivation mechanisms. We estimate the model with data from a knowledge sharing platform StackExchange.com.  Counter-factual experiments from our model provide insights into designing effective mechanisms.
