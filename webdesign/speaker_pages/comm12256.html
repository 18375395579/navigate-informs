<br>Title: Derivative-free Software for Multiagent Hybrid Optimization in Parallel</br><br>Author: Joshua Griffin, Sandia National Laboratories, 4970 Owens Drive Apt 637, Pleasanton, CA, 94588, United States, jgriffi@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tamara Kolda</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We discuss strategies for accelerating convergence of Generating Set Search (GSS) by providing the ability to evaluate externally generated points. These modifications provide several new capabilities: 1) the user may runmultiple local searches simultaneously, 2) the user may concurrently use additional (non-GSS) optimization strategies while sharing common point evaluations, and 3) the ability to extend capabilities to global optimization.</br>
