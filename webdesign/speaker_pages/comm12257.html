Title: National Drug Stock-out Risks in Africa:  The Global Fund Disbursement Process for Procurement<br>Author: Iva Rashkova, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, irashkova.phd2009@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jérémie Gallien, Prashant Yadav, Rifat Atun<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We use historical data to construct and validate distributional forecasts of procurement lead times and disbursement inter-arrival times for Global Fund grants in 53 African countries. We use a validated simulation model to predict impact of these processes on central stock availability of a single product facing constant demand. We find that adjusting disbursement amounts to reflect historical disbursement schedules mitigates the risk of stockouts better than bridge financing or a buffer stock.
