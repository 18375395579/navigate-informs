Title: Analysis of Disease Transmission and Mitigation Strategies in a Clinical Facility<br>Author: Chien-Hung Chen, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, cchen@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eva Lee<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a local outbreak of a highly infectious disease (e.g., smallpox, pneumonic plague, pandemic flu), analyze the potential of disease propagation within a vaccination/drug distribution clinic, and provide insights on how to minimize this risk. We will demonstrate how mathematical modelling can help quantify this risk and assist in the design of an emergency clinic, and show the use of a real-time simulator for mounting an effective monitoring and response against such an event.
