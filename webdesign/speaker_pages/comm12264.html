Title: Decision Tree Voyeurism -- An Unscientific Survey of Real-World DA Models<br>Author: Chris Dalton, Syncopation Software, 1623 Main Street, Concord, MA, 01742, United States of America, cdalton@syncopation.com<br>Coauthor(s): Lori Carswell<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Syncopation's role as vendor of the DPL decision analysis software package puts us in a position to see a large number of real-world decision analysis models -- the good, the bad and the ugly. The models working decision analysts produce as they ply their trade are often quite different from the nice ones they select for presentation to their peers. We've surveyed a sample of real models and will make non-judgmental observations about their technical and methodological characteristics.
