Title: Dynamic Modeling of Portfolio Credit Risk with Common Shocks<br>Author: Tomasz Bielecki, Professor, Applied Mathematics Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, 10 W 32nd Street, E1 Bldg, Chicago, IL, 60616, United States of America, bielecki@iit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephane Crepey, Areski Cousin, Alexander Herbertsson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a bottom-up Markovian copula model of portfolio credit risk where dependence among credit names stems from the possibility of simultaneous defaults. Calibration of marginals and dependence parameters can be performed separately using a two-steps procedure, much like in a standard static copula set-up. As a result this model allows us to hedge CDO tranches using single-name CDS-s in a theoretically sound and practically convenient way.
