Title: Using the Optimization Services hookup Language (OShL) to Invoke Remote Optimization Services<br>Author: Jun Ma, Postdoctoral Fellow, Northwestern University, Department of Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States, maj@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Fourer, Kipp Martin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe an open-source, platform and language independent API that implements OShL, a universal framework for hosting and invoking optimization software as services.  OShL makes use of Web service standards to facilitate synchronous (solve) and asynchronous (send) optimization via the Internet. OShL has built-in features to maintain states (getJobID) between subsequent service invocations, and to remotely knock, kill, and retrieve optimization jobs from the services.
