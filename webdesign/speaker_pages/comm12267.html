However, fitting these models requires computationally expensive matrix inversion or decomposition, a problem exacerbated with functional responses. Separability and stationarity assumptions on the covariance function of the GP model to ease the computational burden.  This work proposes a method to model these functions without the separability assumption while maintaining the computational advantages.</br>
