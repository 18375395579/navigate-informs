<br>Title: Analyzing Nanoparticle Growth with Ex-situ Data</br><br>Author: Chiwoo Park, Assistant Professor, Florida State University, 2525 Pottsdamer St., Tallahassee, FL, 32310-6046, United States of America, cpark5@fsu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian model for analyzing the multi-modal growth of nanoparticles with ex-situ TEM image data in absence of in-situ observations. The model provides Bayesian estimation of multiple growth modes of nanoparticles. The estimation result was consistent with real nanoparticle growth trajectories in empirical studies.</br>
