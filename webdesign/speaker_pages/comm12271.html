<br>Title: Multivariate Profile Monitoring Using Quantile Regression</br><br>Author: Andres Abad, Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, agabad@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Hotelling's T2 control chart is one of the most widely used multivariate quality controls. However, the T2 control chart is very sensitive to the normality assumption and outliers, In this research, we proposed a multivariate monitoring method based on quantile regression, with the advantages of being robust to outliers, free of distribution assumptions.</br>
