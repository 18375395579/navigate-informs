Title: A Statistical Sampling Methodology for eSCM-SP Assessments<br>Author: David Northcutt, Senior Technical Staff Member, IBM, Chester, NJ, United States, northcut@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Paulk<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Performing assessments in large complex organizations quickly becomes cost prohibitive if every component must be assessed for each criterion. This paper presents a stratified sampling methodology for the eSourcing Capability Model for Service Providers. The approach significantly reduces the number of components that must be reviewed while maintaining statistical confidence in the result. An analysis of the probabilistic behavior of the methodology and examples of its use are included.
