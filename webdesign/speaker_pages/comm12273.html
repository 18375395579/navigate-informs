<br>Title: Automating the Analysis of Simulation Output Data</br><br>Author: Katy Hoad, Research Fellow, ORMS Group, Warwick Business School, The University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom, Kathryn.Hoad@wbs.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stewart Robinson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Current simulation software gives little or no guidance in making decisions regarding warm-up, run-length and number of replications.  A three year project sponsored by the EPSRC and SIMUL8 has investigated the development of a methodology for automatically advising a simulation user on these three key decisions.  This paper will present an overview of the work undertaken to create an automated procedure for carrying out simulation output analysis.</br>
