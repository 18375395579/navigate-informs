<br>Title: Unbiased Simulation of Distributions with Explicitly known Integral Transforms</br><br>Author: Nan Chen, Associate Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 709A William Mong Engineering Building, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yiwei Wang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose an importance-sampling based method to obtain an unbiased simulator to evaluate expectations involving random variables whose probability density functions are unknown while their Fourier transforms have an explicit form. This method can be applied effectively to Heston stochastic volatility model, high dimensional affine jump-diffusion model, and various Levy processes.</br>
