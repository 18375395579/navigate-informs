<br>Title: Multivariate Process Capability Analysis with Non-Parametric Bootstrap Method</br><br>Author: Wenzhen Huang, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA, United States of America, whuang@umassd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ankit Pahwa, Zhenyu (James) Kong</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A method is proposed to analyze multivariate process capability (MPC). For a MP process the widely used Cp, Cpk for individuals do not provide complete conformance information. Yield is used for simultaneous conformity in MPC evaluation. A non-parametric bootstrap method is developed, i.e., approximating the pdf  by sampled data and a kernel model and sampling the pdf for yield estimation. A case study compares the estimated yield from 50 samples with the benchmark from a Beta distribution.</br>
