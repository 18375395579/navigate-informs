<br>Title: Future Force Warrior (FFW) Experimentation and Analysis</br><br>Author: Jon Alt, MAJ, USA, Operations Analyst, TRADOC Analysis Center, Monterey, Naval Postgraduate School, P.O. Box 8695, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, jonathan.alt@us.army.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nita Miller, Lawrence Shattuck, Tom Lucas</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research supports FFW’s evaluation of emerging technology through the use of constructive simulation, leveraging large designs of experiments in a high performance computing environment, and live experimentation, making use of more efficient experimental designs and systematically gathered user feedback. Results will be used to determine which technologies hold the most potential to address needed capability gaps.</br>
