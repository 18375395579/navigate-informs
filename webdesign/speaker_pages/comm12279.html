Title: Spatio-temporal Analysis for Ozone Concentration<br>Author: Chivalai Temiyasathit, Ph.D. Student, University of Texas at Arlington, PO Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, chivalai.temiyasathit@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Numerous statistical methods for air pollution modeling have been developed over the past decades. The main purpose of this study is to impute missing values, followed by forecast the pollutants concentration by taken into account both spatial and temporal variability. Our approach was applied to the ozone dataset in Dallas-Fort Worth area. The study reveals that our model can nicely incorporate spatial and temporal variability to facilitate the imputation and forecasting process.
