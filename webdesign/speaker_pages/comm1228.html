Title: Elicitation of Multiattribute Utility Functions through High Dimensional Model Representation<br>Author: Alessandra Cillo, Bocconi University, Via Roentgen 1, 20136 Milan, Italy, alessandra.cillo@unibocconi.it<br>Coauthor(s): Francesca Beccacece, Emanuele Borgonovo, Greg Buzzard, Stanley Zionts<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Our paper exploits the connection between multiattribute utility theory and high dimensional model representation theory for investigating the properties of multiattribute utility functions without stating any a-priori assumption on an individuals' preference structure. We test the method via an experiment in a riskless context in which subjects are asked to evaluate mobile phone packages that differ on three attributes. We obtain insights on monotonicity and additivity.
