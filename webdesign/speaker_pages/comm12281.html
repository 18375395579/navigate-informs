Title: An Optimization-Simulation Approach to Model the Routing of Public Transit Systems for No-notice Mass<br>Author: Fatemeh Sayyady, Research Assistant, Mississippi State University, 350 McCain Engineering Building, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, United States, fs131@msstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sandra Duni Eksioglu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This study investigates how the public transit system can be used in no-notice mass evacuation using an optimization-simulation approach. In optimization stage, a mixed integer linear programming formulation is used to model the routing of the public transit system. A heuristic tabu search algorithm finds the near-optimal solution shortly. In simulation stage, a dynamic traffic network analysis and evaluation tool, DYNASMART-P, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed routing plan.
