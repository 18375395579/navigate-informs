In optimization stage, a mixed integer linear programming formulation is used to model the routing of the public transit system. A heuristic tabu search algorithm finds the near-optimal solution shortly. In simulation stage, a dynamic traffic network analysis and evaluation tool, DYNASMART-P, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed routing plan.</br>
