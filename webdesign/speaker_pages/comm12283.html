Experimental evidence has shown that this uncertainty (ambiguity) is accompanied by behavioral consequences. We explore  the explicit modelling of these attitudes using minimax, subjective expected utility and smooth ambiguity functionals in combination with the traditional decision-analysis representation of choice problems.</br>
