Title: Platform Identification Using Data Mining for Service Family Design<br>Author: Timothy Simpson, Professor, Penn State University, 329 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, tws8@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seung Ki Moon, Soundar Kumara<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new methodology to identify a module-based platform for service family design using service-based process analysis and data mining techniques. We employ fuzzy clustering to determine modules for platform design in a given service family. The clustering result is identified as a platform by the fuzzy set theory and classification. To demonstrate implementation of the proposed methodology, we use a case study involving a family of banking services.
