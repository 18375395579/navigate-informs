Even if a Bayes optimal classifier can be obtained, the inter-group misclassification rates may be higher than desirable.    Constrained discrimination models are classification models that allow for the non-classification of observations until more information is collected.  We analyze the consistency of a mixed-integer programming formulation of a constrained discrimination model.</br>
