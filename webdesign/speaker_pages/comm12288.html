Title: Planning for Disruptions in Facility Location Models<br>Author: Kaiyue Zheng, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, kzheng23@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laura McLay<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: To hedge against the risk of interdictions to facility systems,  planners may fortify the existing network to make it more  reliable, or design a network that is resilient to disruptions.  We present models addressing both topics, including a  defender-interdictor location model with uncertain futures, and  a location design model with heuristic and optimal  interdictions. Algorithms are discussed for both models.
