Title: Phase I Analysis for Monitoring Nonlinear Profiles in Manufacturing Processes<br>Author: Li Zeng, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, lzeng1@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding, Shiyu Zhou<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The high dimensionality and data contamination present a challenge to the Phase I analysis of nonlinear profiles. This paper presents a strategy which constitutes a data reduction component that projects the original data into a lower dimension subspace and a data separation technique that detects single and multiple shifts as well as outliers in the data.
