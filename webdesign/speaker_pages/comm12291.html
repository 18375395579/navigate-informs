<br>Title: Applications of Ordinal Optimization: Some Examples</br><br>Author: Qing-Shan Jia, Lecturer, Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China, jiaqs@tsinghua.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Qianchuan Zhao, Yu-Chi Ho</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Ordinal optimization is a method developed for the optimization of complex systems via simulation models or other computation-intensive models involving possible stochastic effects and discrete choices. After briefly reviewing this approach, in this talk we present the various successful applications of ordinal optimization in manufacturing systems and decision making, in problems with multiple objective functions and constraints.</br>
