Title: Agent-based Simulation of Learning Adversaries in Defender-attacker Games<br>Author: Emily Zechman, Assistant Professor, North Carolina State University, CB 7908, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, emzechma@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seth Guikema<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Advanced analytical methods typically model defender-attacker games by assuming a static decision-making process for players.  Over a series of plays and pay-offs, however, both defenders and attackers may adapt their decision-making strategy and their assumptions about the adversary’s decision-making strategy.  This research couples agent-based modeling with game theory to simulate the evolution of a game and pay-offs as players learn.
