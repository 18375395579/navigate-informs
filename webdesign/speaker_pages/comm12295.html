Title: Simulated Likelihood Inference for Jump-diffusions<br>Author: Gustavo Schwenkler, Stanford University, 1045 Alma St, Palo Alto, CA, 94301, United States of America, gschwenk@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kay Giesecke<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop likelihood estimators for the parameters of a discretely observed jump-diffusion with state-depend drift, diffusion and jump intensity functions. The estimators are based on a novel representation of the transition density that can be computed exactly using an exact sampling algorithm. We provide conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators. Numerical results illustrate our approach.
