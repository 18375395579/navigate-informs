Title: A Generalised Perioperative Simulation-based Decision Support Tool<br>Author: Daphne Sniekers, University of Toronto, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, daphne.sniekers@utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Carter<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The perioperative process of three Ontario hospitals has been modelled from decision to operative to discharge. The models simulate patient flow and allows the use to evaluate a variety of strategic decisions in an effort to improve key measures such as procedure volume, cancellation rate and utilisation.  Common process flow characteristics between hospitals are compiled in an effort to build a reusable base model for any hospital.
