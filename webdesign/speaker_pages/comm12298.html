Title: POAMS: The Platform for Object-algebraic Modeling Systems<br>Author: Leo Lopes, University of Arizona, University of Arizona - SIE, Tucson, AZ, United States of America, leo@sie.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Victor Foulk<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: POAMS is a non-commercial, object-oriented linear optimization modeling environment leveraging the versatility of Python. It is a test bed for new modeling constructs and offers set-based modeling syntax and instance level manipulation capabilities. POAMS also provides access to external data sources such as Excel, OpenOffice.org, and most DBAPI 2.0 databases, as well as computational environments such as MATLAB, and R.
