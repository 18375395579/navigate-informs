Title: Application of AHP and Taguchi Loss Functions in Evaluation of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies<br>Author: Sharon Ordoobadi, University of Massachusetts, 285 Old Westport road, Dartmouth, MA, 02747, United States of America, sordoobadi@umassd.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Both risks and benefits of implementing a new technology are identified. Since these factors can be objective and subjective a hybrid approach is used in the development of the model. Taguchi loss functions are used to measure performance of each technology candidate with respect to the risks and benefits. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine the relative importance of these factors. The composite weighted loss scores are calculated and used for ranking of the technologies.
