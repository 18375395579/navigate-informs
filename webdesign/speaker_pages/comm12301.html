Title: Modeling Noisy Functions via Regression and its Applications to Derivative-Free Optimization<br>Author: Ruobing Chen, Lehigh University, 27 Memorial Drive West, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, ruc310@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Katya Scheinberg<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Problems with numerical noise form the key domain of Derivative-Free Optimization (DFO) algorithms and response surface methodology. We propose a general DFO algorithm for noisy problems. This algorithm utilizes regularized regression models that leverage between model complexity and the level of noise in a function. For controllable noise, an accuracy adjustment procedure is employed to dynamically reduce noise level. Numerical studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
