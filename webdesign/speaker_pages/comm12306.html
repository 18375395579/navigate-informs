Title: Estimating Potential Fuel Savings from Continuous Descent Arrivals (CDAs)<br>Author: Joseph Post, Manager, Modeling and Simulation, FAA/ATO-P, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC, 20591, United States of America, Joseph.Post@faa.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Murphy, Michael Wells<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Aircraft arrival procedures often involve a “stepped?descent from cruise altitude.  These periods of low-altitude flight cause aircraft to burn more fuel.  In contrast, continuous descent arrival (CDAs) allow the aircraft to fly higher, longer.  We estimate the potential benefits of using CDAs using BADA performance tables, radar track data, and forecasts of future traffic.  Our results compare favorably with data from actual flight tests.
