Title: Cooperative Infrastructure and Vehicle Intersection Control: Evaluation and Design using an Integrated Traffic-Driving-Networking Simulator<br>Author: Yunjie Zhao, Student, University at Buffalo, SUNY, 204c ketter hall, Amherst, NY, 14226, United States of America, yunjiezh@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yunfei Hou, Aditya Wagh, Kevin Hulme, Chunming Qiao, Adel Sadek<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper describes a trans-disciplinary research initiative aimed at developing an integrated traffic-driving-networking simulator for the design and evaluation of Cyber Transportation Systems and Connected Vehicle applications.  The study demonstrates the unique advantages of human-in-the-loop in the evaluation and design of CTS applications. A truly Cooperative Infrastructure and Vehicle Intersection Control is deployed to optimize both the signal timing and approach vehicle speed profile.
