<br>Title: A Simulation-optimization Approach for Large-scale Wildfire Extended Attack Response Planning</br><br>Author: Michelle M. Alvarado, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, michelle.mcgaha@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lewis Ntaimo</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Our simulation-optimization approach integrates a stochastic integer programming (SIP) model for wildfire extended attack planning with DEVS-FIRE, a fire spread and suppression discrete event simulation model. The SIP model optimizes the location and timing of the deployment of firefighting resources to an escaped large-scale wildfire. The SIP decisions and weather forecasts are used in DEVS-FIRE to generate fire spread scenarios, which become input for the SIP model in the next decision period.</br>
