Title: Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning<br>Author: Abhijit Gosavi, University at Buffalo, SUNY, 317 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, United States, agosavi@buffalo.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Concepts such as variance and downside risk have been used by economists as measures of risk.  In the field of artificial intelligence, the use of risk measures is a relatively new development.  We present some reinforcement learning algorithms that employ risk measures, along with some numerical results from industrial problems.
