<br>Title: Viability and Service Evolution</br><br>Author: Ralph Badinelli, Professor, Virginia Tech, Dept. of Business Information Technology, Virginia Tech 0235, Blacksburg, VA, 23060, United States of America, ralphb@vt.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We examine the trajectories of a service through service processes within a service ecosystem. By modeling the decisions of agents in terms of fuzzy decision models which reflect the abductive phase of service innovation we establish a framework for describing the trajectories of different types of agents in different types of service systems. We also provide a precise and measurable definition of service viability and connect the performance of trajectories to the viable systems approach (VSA).</br>
