Complementary and conflicting institutional logics are examined from a systems perspective to evaluate implications for healthcare providers as they consider the adoption of EHR platforms.  Combining Institutional Logics with System Dynamics is used to examine the interplay of multiple institutional logics upon EHR adoption.
