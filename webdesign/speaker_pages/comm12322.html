Title: Ranking and Selection with Unknown Correlation Structures<br>Author: Huashuai Qu, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States of America, huashuai@math.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ilya Ryzhov, Michael Fu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We create the first computationally tractable Bayesian statistical model for learning unknown correlations among alternatives in fully sequential ranking and selection. We can learn the unknown values and unknown correlations simultaneously with the model. A Bayesian procedure is derived to allocate simulations based on the value of information. We test the model and algorithm in a simulation study motivated by the problem of optimal wind farm placement, and obtain encouraging empirical results.
