Title: Agent-based Simulation for Dual Toll Pricing of Hazardous Material Transportation<br>Author: Sojung Kim, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85719, United States of America, sojungkim@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Young-Jun Son, Mungle Santosh<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The goal of dual toll pricing policy is to mitigate a risk of hazardous materials (hazmat) transportation via deterring hazmat traffic flow from regular traffic. This paper aims at developing a simulation model for the dual toll pricing policy under a realistic road network environment, where an extended BDI modeling framework is employed to mimic the driver’s decision making behaviors in a great detail. The proposed approach is successfully demonstrated for the traffic data of Albany, NY.
