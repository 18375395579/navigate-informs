The proposed model is based on a combination of statistical natural language processing techniques with a novel machine-learning mechanism. The model is trained on a recently annotated financial dataset, which contains a large number of attributes for features commonly found in financial text. The model is compared with multiple baselines to study the performance gains obtained due to the newly introduced aspects.
