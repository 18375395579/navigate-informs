Title: Exploring User Behavior in Online Network Equilibrium Problems<br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Assistant Professor, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, JEC-4032, 110 8th Street, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, ukkuss@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gopal Patil<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We develop an online traffic assignment model which incorporates the en-route recourse actions. While accounting for recourse using an online shortest path algorithm, we incorporate travelers cost perception behavior using logit route choice model.  Numerical results on a test network are demonstrated to show the benefit of the developed model over the traditional static traffic assignment.
