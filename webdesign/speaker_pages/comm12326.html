Title: Efficiency and Sensitivity Analyses in the Evaluation of University Departments<br>Author: Ahti Salo, Professor, Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory, P.O. Box 1100, Espoo, FI, 02015, Finland, ahti.salo@tkk.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Antti Punkka<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a value efficiency model for comparing the efficiency of university departments and for allocating resources among them. The model permits extensive sensitivity analyses about the choice of key inputs/outputs and their weightings: thus, for example, it helps determine the highest and lowest possible rankings for the departments and characterizes those weights that would result in a given efficiency ranking. The model is generally applicable, and it has already been employed at TKK.
