<br>Title: Market Segmentation within Consolidated E-Markets: A Generalized Combinatorial Auction Approach</br><br>Author: Joni Jones, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, Information Systems and Decision Science, 4202 E. Folower Avenue, CIS1040, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, jjones@coba.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gary J. Koehler, Robert F. Easley</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We analyze an e-market allowing multiple market segments to be served simultaneously with a single generalized combinatorial auction. The mechanism uses rule-based bids that accommodate various kinds of bidders, such as price sensitive or more restricted in their requirements. We demonstrate experimentally, using agent-based simulation, that the rule-based approach handles the wide range of market segments, while maintaining buyer and seller surplus and efficiently allocating goods.</br>
