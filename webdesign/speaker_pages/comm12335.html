<br>Title: Local Recurrence Model for Performance Prediction in Multi-stage Manufacturing Systems</br><br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Associate Professor, Oklahoma State University, School of IE and Mgt., Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, satish.t.bukkapatnam@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Yang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Nonlinear stochastic dynamics of manufacturing systems leads to distinct recurrence behavior of system evolution. We present a local recurrence model for predicting throughputs in multistage manufacturing assembly lines. The model captures the nonstationarity as well as the nonlinearity of the dynamics, and yields around 35% performance improvement in the prediction of throughputs from a manufacturing system compared to any global predictor.</br>
