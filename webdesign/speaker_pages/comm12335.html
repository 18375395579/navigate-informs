Title: Local Recurrence Model for Performance Prediction in Multi-stage Manufacturing Systems<br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Associate Professor, Oklahoma State University, School of IE and Mgt., Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, satish.t.bukkapatnam@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hui Yang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Nonlinear stochastic dynamics of manufacturing systems leads to distinct recurrence behavior of system evolution. We present a local recurrence model for predicting throughputs in multistage manufacturing assembly lines. The model captures the nonstationarity as well as the nonlinearity of the dynamics, and yields around 35% performance improvement in the prediction of throughputs from a manufacturing system compared to any global predictor.
