The theory is relevant not only to cognition, but can also handle other types of problems.  Our work relates Conceptual Spaces to Data Fusion, namely at Level 2 - Situational Assessment.  We introduce mathematical models used to represent Conceptual Spaces and show how they can be useful in considering situations presented by a data fusion system.</br>
