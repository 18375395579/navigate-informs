Title: Stopping Pandemic Flu: Government & Community Interventions in a Multi-community Model<br>Author: Karima Nigmatulina, MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, knigmatu@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Larson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Using a new model of infection spread between contiguous heterogeneous communities we evaluate the implementation and timing of primarily non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. We also include changes in human behavior by introducing a feedback parameter into the model. We find, among other conclusions, that spatial quarantine and isolation strategies are unlikely to succeed.
