Title: Emission Modeling and Control in Dynamic Traffic Networks<br>Author: Rui Ma, Research Assistant, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street, JEC 5107, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, mar2@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuegang Ban<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the network-wide emission control problem by modeling the dynamic evolution of network traffic states. Numerical results are shown to illustrate the proposed modeling approach.
