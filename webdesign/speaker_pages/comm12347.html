Title: An Analytics Approach to Designing Clinical Trials for Cancer<br>Author: Allison O'Hair, Lecturer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, akohair@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Silberholz, Dimitris Bertsimas, Stephen Relyea<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose an analytics approach to designing chemotherapy regimens, the leading treatment for advanced cancer. We develop statistical models to predict the survival and toxicity of new drug combinations. Using these models, we develop an optimization approach to select novel treatment regimens to test in clinical trials. For gastroesophageal cancer, we provide evidence that our decision aid could simultaneously improve patient survival and toxicity outcomes compared to current practice.
