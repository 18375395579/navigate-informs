We develop statistical models to predict the survival and toxicity of new drug combinations. Using these models, we develop an optimization approach to select novel treatment regimens to test in clinical trials. For gastroesophageal cancer, we provide evidence that our decision aid could simultaneously improve patient survival and toxicity outcomes compared to current practice.</br>
