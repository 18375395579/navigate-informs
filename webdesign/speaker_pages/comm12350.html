Box 3707 MC 7L-21, Seattle, WA, 98124, United States, Laura.S.Kang@Boeing.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research analyzes alternatives that Boeing Commerical Airlines proposes, where each alternative has different airport capacities. The National Flow Model (NFM) is used to compare annual delay statistics for each alternative. A challenge is to get annualized delay statistics without running the NFM for 365 days. We present a quadratic programming model for selecting representative weather days. We also present annualized delay results from the analysis.</br>
