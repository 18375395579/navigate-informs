Title: Adwords Allocation Problem with Unreliabe Estimates<br>Author: Hamid Nazerzadeh, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, hamidnz@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amin Saberi, Mohammad Mahdian<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, or MSN use auction mechanism for allocating the advertisement space. In this work, our objective is to find an algorithm that uses given estimates of the frequencies of the queries to find a near-optimal allocation, while maintaining a good worst-case performance when the given estimates are inaccurate. In order to evaluate our algorithm, we present a bi-criteria framework, which also can be extended to design and analysis of other online algorithms.
