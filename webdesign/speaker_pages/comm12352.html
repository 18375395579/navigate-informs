Title: Case Article: Flight Delays at RegionEx<br>Author: Susan Martonosi, Harvey Mudd College, Department of Mathematics, Claremont, CA, United States of America, martonosi@hmc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amr Farahat<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this case about two fictitious airlines, RegionEx, a small regional airline, is a contracted regional carrier for MDA, a major US airline.  RegionEx is at risk of losing its contract due to an apparently poor flight delay record, and the Flight Operations Manager must analyze the flight delay records and explain RegionEx’s seemingly poor performance.  Undergraduate and MBA students use basic data analysis techniques to discover important paradoxes in the flight delay data.
