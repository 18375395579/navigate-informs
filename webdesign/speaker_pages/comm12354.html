Title: Whole-System Patient Flow Simulation Model<br>Author: Ali Esensoy, PhD student, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, ali.esensoy@utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Carter<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Cross-sector patient flow model is a system dynamics simulation focused on the flow rates of patients between health system sectors, and the feedback structures around them. It takes a whole-system, strategic perspective, and is designed to produce output that captures the direction and magnitude resulting from policy changes around patient pathways and service levels. We discuss our development process, the model components and examples of policy analyses conducted using the final simulation.
