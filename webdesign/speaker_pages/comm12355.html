Title: Response Surface Metholodgy for Simulating Hedging and Trading Strategies<br>Author: Evern Baysal, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, e-baysal@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Barry L Nelson, Jeremy Staum<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The distribution of profit and loss resulting from a dynamic trading strategy can be evaluated by nested simulation: at every time step on every simulated path of the relevant financial variables, portfolio weights are estimated by simulation. We use kriging to model portfolio weights as a function of underlying financial variables and show that it provides accuracy comparable to nested simulation with much less computational effort.
