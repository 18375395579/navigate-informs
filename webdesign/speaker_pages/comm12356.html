<br>Title: Image Registration with Mutual Information</br><br>Author: Derek Armstrong, Technical Staff Member, Los Alamos National Laboratory, P.O. Box 1663, MS F605, Los Alamos, NM, 87545, United States of America, dearmstr@lanl.gov</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Image registration is the problem of finding a geometric transformation between two images of the same area that preserves the spatial correspondence of image objects. Mutual information (MI) provides a method for measuring the mutual dependence of two random variables and it can be used as a similarity metric in image registration problems. The MI metric is studied and applied to the problem of registering infrared images to visible images.</br>
