<br>Title: Determinants and Variants in Urban Goods Demand Strategic Modeling</br><br>Author: Jesus Gonzales-Feliu, Research Engineer, Laboratoire d'Economie des Transports, 14 Avenue Berthelot, Lyon, France, jesus.gonzales-feliu@let.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper aims to propose a methodological analysis of modelling units for urban goods from several Urban Goods Movement surveys, mainly on the basis of the modelling unit: movement and commodity. Data quality, computational effort and aggregation level are analysed. Then we propose a procedure that relates both via an analytical model. After calibrating this procedure on real data from those surveys, we propose various application cases.</br>
