Title: Classifying Nursing Homes in the Presence of Incomplete and Inconsistent Data<br>Author: Murray Côt? Associate Professor, University of Colorado Denver, Health Care Policy & Research, 13611 E. Colfax Avenue, Suite 100, Aurora, CO, 80045, United States of America, Murray.Cote@UCHSC.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gino Lim, Allen Holder<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: It is generally known that the Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) database has some important analytic limitations when evaluating nursing home quality giving rise to an interesting and timely identification problem. How can we classify nursing homes in the presence of incomplete (i.e., not all aspects of the OSCAR database are reported) and inconsistent (i.e., nursing homes are not all evaluated identically) data? We will examine a variety of methods and report on their results.
