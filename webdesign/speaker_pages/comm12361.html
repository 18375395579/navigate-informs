Title: Customer Data Reconstruction Methods for Response Modeling<br>Author: Sungzoon Cho, Professor, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, zoon@snu.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Doug MacLachlan, PilSung Kang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Response modeling is concerned with identifying potential buyers  based on customers' demographic and behavioral data. However, there are many more non-responders than responders in the data set, resulting in low accuracy. Here, we investigate various customer data reconstruction methods for handling class imbalance in response modeling. An empirical study using a real customer data set is conducted.
