Title: Quoting Customer Lead Time via Simulation-based Statistical Methods<br>Author: Minqi Li, PhD Student, West Virginia University, 777 Chestnut Ridge Road, Morgantown, WV, 26505, United States of America, mli6@mix.wvu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Fowler, Feng Yang, Hong Wan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A comprehensive framework is developed to model the lead time distribution of a new order as a function of the shop status characteristics. An experimental design methodology is developed to investigate the dependence of lead time upon a complete and non-redundant set of shop status factors. Statistical models are estimated from well-designed simulation experiments for lead time quotation.
