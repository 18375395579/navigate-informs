Title: The Impact of Supply Quality Information and Supplier Development  on Contract Design<br>Author: Sila Cetinkaya, Associate Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, sila@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xingchu Liu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We develop analytical models for designing optimal buyer-initiated supply contracts with supply quality and supplier development considerations while modeling private information and individual incentives explicitly. We use optimal control theory for computing the optimal contract parameters and provide a DP-based decision framework for managing supply quality information uncertainty.
