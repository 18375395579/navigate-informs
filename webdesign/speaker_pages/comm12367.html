<br>Title: Modeling A Periodic Distribution Problem</br><br>Author: Peter Francis, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, Department of IE/MS, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, pete@iems.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karen Smilowitz</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a continuum approximation model for the Period Vehicle Routing Problem with Service Choice (PVRP-SC). The PVRP-SC is a variant of the Period Vehicle Routing Problem in which the visit frequency to nodes is a decision of the model.  This variation can result in more efficient vehicle tours and/or greater service benefit to customers. The model helps evaluate the value of service choice in the strategic and tactical planning of periodic distribution systems.</br>
