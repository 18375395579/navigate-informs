<br>Title: A Bayesian Approach to Output Analysis of Limit Standards</br><br>Author: Roy Creasey, Assistant Professor, Longwood University, 201 High Street, Farmville, VA, 23901, United States of America, creaseyrr@longwood.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Preston White</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Limit standards have been defined as probabilistic requirements that specify confidence on the maximum proportion of simulation runs yielding values of an output variable above or below a desired threshold.  Typical analysis methods utilize the binomial distribution.  This research investigates the relationship between the binomial and beta distributions, and develops a Bayesian sequential approach to analysis of limit standards.</br>
