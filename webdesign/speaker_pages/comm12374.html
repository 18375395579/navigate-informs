Title: Design of DOE-Based Automatic Process Controller with Consideration of Model Uncertainties<br>Author: Jing Zhong, University of Michigan, jzhong@engin.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jianjun Shi, Jeff Wu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper developed a DOE-based automatic process control scheme considering both observation and modeling uncertainties. The simulation demonstrates that considering the uncertainties, automatic controllers can achieve better process performance than conventional off-line design, and more stable than normal APC controllers. The proposed approach is illustrated using an industrial process.
