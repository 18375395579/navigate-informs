Using border surveillance as an example, this study presents the results from a probabilistic risk analysis model and constructive simulation of the 28-mile demonstration project conducted as part of SBI Net.  The work provides an example of how these methods can be used to help evaluate proposed technologies for border security and develop concepts of operation for their use.</br>
