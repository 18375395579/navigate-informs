<br>Title: Connecting the Top-down to the Bottom-up: Pricing CDO under a Conditional Survival (CS) Model</br><br>Author: Steven Kou, Columbia University, 312 Mudd, Department of IEOR, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, sk75@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xianhua Peng</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The current subprime mortgage crisis showed that prevalent CDO pricing models incorrectly valuated default risk. We propose a new dynamic model, the conditional survival (CS) model, which provides excellent calibration to both iTraxx tranche and underlying single name CDS on March 14, 2008, the day before the collapse of Bear Stern, when the market was highly volatile. The CS model generates strong correlation among underlying names and allows fast CDO tranche pricing through exact simulation.</br>
