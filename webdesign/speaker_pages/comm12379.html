Chick, Alfons Grabosch</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a mathematical model for T2 Diabetes that comprehends the interactions of multiple interventions including primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. We use the model to design an optimal preventive care policy. We compare the model outcomes with real-life recommendations, and provide insights on multi-level chronic disease prevention.</br>
