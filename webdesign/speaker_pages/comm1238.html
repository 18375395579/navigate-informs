A synthetic population of individuals and households for Chicago is developed based on census and survey data. Agents are matched to activity profiles relevant to disease transmission, specifically community-associated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). The presentation describes the development of the network and analysis of its topological properties.</br>
