Title: Deriving Infectious Disease Contact Networks through Agent-based Simulation<br>Author: Charles Macal, Senior Systems Engineer, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S.

A synthetic population of individuals and households for Chicago is developed based on census and survey data. Agents are matched to activity profiles relevant to disease transmission, specifically community-associated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). The presentation describes the development of the network and analysis of its topological properties.
