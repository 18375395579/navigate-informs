The Center for Army Analysis first developed the MARATHON simulation to analyze Army Force Generation for the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review. MARATHON is now used for a wide range of analytical efforts concerning force sizing and management. This presentation describes Army Force Generation, the modeling approach that we employ in MARATHON, and some results from our analyses.</br>
