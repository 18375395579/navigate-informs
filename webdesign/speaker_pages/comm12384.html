<br>Title: Staffing for Call Centers with General Abandonment Distributions</br><br>Author: Ramandeep Randhawa, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 78704, United States of America, Ramandeep.Randhawa@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Achal Bassamboo</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the optimal capacity sizing problem for a M/M/N+G system. In a large system setting, we observe that under the optimal operating regime intricately depends on the abandonment distribution. In particular, for many common distributions, the optimal regime has a traffic intensity greater than 1. We propose a fluid based solution and demonstrate its efficacy via simulations.</br>
