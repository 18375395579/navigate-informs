<br>Title: Verifying Limit Standards Based on Binary Outcomes Derived from Monte Carlo Simulation</br><br>Author: Preston White, Professor, University of Virginia, PO Box 400747, 151 Engineers' Way, Charlottesville, VA, 23901, United States, kpwhite@virginia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roy Creasey</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We illustrate the use of acceptance sampling by attributes (ASA) to probabilistic requirements verification using Monte Carlo simulation. Given the required probability of attaining a specified limit and the required confidence that this probability is achieved, ASA can determine a family of appropriate (n,c) sampling plans.  We illustrate how this approach to statistical inference can be implemented with an example from aerospace engineering.</br>
