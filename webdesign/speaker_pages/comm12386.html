Title: Large Deviations for the Empirical Measure of an Importance Sampling Algorithm<br>Author: Henrik Hult, Associate Professor, Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Mathematics, Stockholm, SE-100 44, Sweden, hult@kth.se<br>Coauthor(s): Pierre Nyquist<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Extreme risk in a financial or actuarial context is often quantified by a quantile or other tail-based risk measure. However, there may be a need to compute many rare-event probabilities for an accurate evaluation of a risk measure. In this talk we present a large deviations result for the empirical measure resulting from an importance sampling algorithm and show how the associated rate function can be used to quantify the performance of the algorithm.
