Title: Stock Index Forecasting Based on an EMD-based Hybrid Model<br>Author: Youqin Pan, Assistant Professor, Salem State University, 352 Lafayette Street, Salem, MA, 01945, United States of America, youqinpan@my.unt.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A novel forecasting model based on empirical mode decomposition(EMD) is proposed to predict stock market index. The proposed method first use EMD to adaptively decompose the complicated stock index into a small number of intrinsic mode functions(IMFs) and a residue. Then, hybrid models integrating EMD and Neural Networks Models were employed to predict the stock index.
