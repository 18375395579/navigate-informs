The outcome--attributes relation is modeled using linear regression. We derive the first simulation procedure for learning unknown regression parameters and sampling noise. We apply convex approximation with a quantization procedure and semidefinte programming relaxation to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation experiments demonstrate the efficient performance of the approximation.</br>
