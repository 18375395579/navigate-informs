Title: A Link-node Complementarity DUE Model with Departure Time Choice<br>Author: Xuegang (Jeff) Ban, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th St, JEC 4034, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, banx@rpi.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a link-node complementarity model for dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) with departure time choice. The departure time choice is modeled by introducing penalty functions for late/early arrivals in the link-node fashion. Numerical results are provided to show the performance of the model.
