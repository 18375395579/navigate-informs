<br>Title: Agent-Based Simulation of a Lumber Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Sophie D'Amours, FORAC Research Consortium, Universit?Laval, Pavillon Pouliot, Québec, Qc, G1K 7P4, Canada, Sophie.damours@forac.ulaval.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Luis Antonio Santa-Eulalia, Sébastien Lemieux, Jean-Marc Frayret, Alain Rousseau</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present an agent-based simulator to test supply chain configurations and planning approaches for the lumber industry. The architecture of the simulator and a proposed simulation framework are discussed. Impacts of different planning approaches are evaluated. The simulator builds on FIPA standards and integrates optimization modules. The application deals with sawmills, drying and finishing facilities, warehouses and customer buying behavior.</br>
