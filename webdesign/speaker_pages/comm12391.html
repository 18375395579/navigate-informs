<br>Title: The Java Simulation Library in Designing and Optimizing a Supply-Chain Simulation Model</br><br>Author: Hugh Medal, PhD Student, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Industrial Engineering Department, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, hmedal@uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Manuel Rossetti</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We demonstrate the use of the Java Simulation Library (JSL) through the entire process of optimizing a supply-chain simulation model.  We introduce the unique features of the JSL and its useful framework for supply-chain, transportation logistics, and inventory modeling.  We next outline the statistical features of the JSL and how they facilitate simulation-based optimization.  Finally, we discuss oppurtunities for users to easily extend existing simulation-based optimization capabilities.</br>
