<br>Title: Outcome and State Transition Modeling for Adaptive Interdisciplinary Pain Management</br><br>Author: Aera LeBoulluec, PhD Student/GRA, University of Texas-Arlington, 2205 Hunter Place Lane, Arlington, TX, 76006, United States of America, aera.leboulluec@mavs.uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Li Zeng, Victoria Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this research, we seek adaptive treatment strategies for interdisciplinary pain management using data from the Eugene McDermott Center for Pain Management at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.  An adaptive dynamic programming approach is formulated to improve current and future pain outcomes. Outcome and state transition modeling handle the problem of endogeneity via an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach.</br>
