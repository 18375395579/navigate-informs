Title: Real-time Link Travel Time Estimation using License-plate Recognition Data<br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sukkusur@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xianyuan Zhan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: License-plate recognition data from video cameras is an emerging data source in urban transportation system.  Due to cost and privacy issues, limited research has been done to develop models for link travel time estimation using LPR data.  In this study, a new methodology of utilizing LPR data to estimate intersection queueing delay and urban link travel times is proposed.  Numerical experiments using LPR data from Qinghuangdao, China, is performed to validate the proposed model.
