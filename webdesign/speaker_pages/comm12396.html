Title: A Multiclass Queueing Model of Limit Order Book Dynamics<br>Author: Hua Zheng, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, hzheng14@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Costis Maglaras, Ciamac Moallemi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We formulate and solve a problem of limit and market order placement in a limit order book to optimally buy a block of shares over a short, predetermined time horizon. We use the structure of the optimal execution policy to propose a microstructure model of market impact, which we estimate using trade data and highlight its increased accuracy over macro market impact models.
