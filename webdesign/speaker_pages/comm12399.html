Title: Humanitarian Transportation Planning: Human and Modeling Approaches<br>Author: Erica Gralla, Assistant Professor, The George Washington University, 1776 G Street Suite 101, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, egralla@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Charles Fine, Jarrod Goentzel<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In disaster response, a key challenge is planning and prioritizing the use of vehicles to transport humanitarian aid. The changing, urgent, multi-objective context makes it difficult to formulate and deploy useful planning models. We explore improvement approaches that build on the strengths of models and human decision-makers. The performance of models and heuristics are evaluated to identify decision-making approaches that are both effective and implementable in the humanitarian context.
