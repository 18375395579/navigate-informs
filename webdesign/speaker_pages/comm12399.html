The changing, urgent, multi-objective context makes it difficult to formulate and deploy useful planning models. We explore improvement approaches that build on the strengths of models and human decision-makers. The performance of models and heuristics are evaluated to identify decision-making approaches that are both effective and implementable in the humanitarian context.</br>
