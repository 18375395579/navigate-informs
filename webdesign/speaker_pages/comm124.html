Title: Estimating Airport Hub Potential in the Context of a Network Model<br>Author: Gene Lin, The MITRE Corporation, 7515 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA, 22102, United States of America, gclin@mitre.org<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Wells<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Discrete choice models are used to estimate the demand for travel over a set of competing itineraries, often including connections at a hub airport.  As a practical matter, the set of possible hubs (and thus itineraries) is usually treated as exogenous.  Unfortunately, this precludes changes to the set of hubs over time.  Our research attempts to endogenize whether or not an airport may be used as a connecting hub.  The model will be tested against actual data.
