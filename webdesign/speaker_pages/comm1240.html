<br>Title: Reliability Based Design Optimization for Critical Infrastructure Protection Decision Support</br><br>Author: Mark McDonald, Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, Los Alamos, NM, 87545, United States, mark.p.mcdonald@vanderbilt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Izraelevitz, Dennis R. Powell, John Ambrosiano</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The methods of reliability based design optimization (RBDO) are widely used in design applications in many engineering fields. However, RBDO can be applied to problems in policy decision making under uncertainty. In this paper, RBDO methods are adapted to optimize local public health responses under uncertainty to a pandemic influenza outbreak. Using existing models of infrastructures to simulate system responses, the method can be applied to other problems in critical infrastructure protection.</br>
