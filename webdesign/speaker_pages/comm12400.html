Title: Statistical Analyses for Process Improvement: A Distillation Case Study<br>Author: Nitin Kaistha, Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Technology, Department of Chemical Engineering, Kanpur, 208016, India, nkaistha@iitk.ac.in<br>Coauthor(s): Mary Leitnaker<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Distillation is the most ubiquitous of unit operations in the chemical industry. An array of statistical tools ranging from univariate to multivariate methods can be used to evaluate the historical data for expected column behavior and to decipher signatures in the common cause variability that indicate problems presenting opportunities for process improvement. This session focuses on the engineering issues that must be considered in tailoring the statistical analyses towards that end.
