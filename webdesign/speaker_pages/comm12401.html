<br>Title: Using Shapley Value Analytics to Set Customer Satisfaction Priorities Based on Kano Theory</br><br>Author: Kenneth M. Powaga, Sr. Vice President, GfK Custom Research, LLC, 8401 Golden Valley Road, Minneapolis, MN, 55427, United States of America, ken.powaga@gfk.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stan Lipovetsky, W. Michael Conklin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A key challenge with Customer Satisfaction Measurement is modeling the relationship between outcome and performance measures to deliver results that are actionable.  This presentation demonstrates a unique method of Key Driver Analysis, KDA, based on Shapley Value Analysis from Cooperative Game Theory.  It fits the non-linear and non-additive Kano Customer Satisfaction model by separating key drivers of dissatisfaction from the drivers of customer delight. KDA is an original non-regression technique which has been implemented with a web-tool and used globally for many clients in a variety of industries with actionable results that are validated with increased customer loyalty.</br>
