<br>Title: A Joint Model for Computing the SBM Efficiency and Super-efficiency</br><br>Author: Chien-Ming Chen, Assistant Professor, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Business School, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, Singapore, cmchen@ntu.edu.sg</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a method to compute SBM efficiency and super-efficiency (SE) in one model. We show that the traditional SBM-SE method may rely on weakly-efficient reference points, and that the SBM-SE score is sensitive to small data variations. We also show that the SBM model can create a space of “super-inefficiency?undetectable by the traditional SBM methods. We propose a model to overcome the above issues.</br>
