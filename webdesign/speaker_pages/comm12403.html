<br>Title: Using Emprical Data Analysis and Simulation to Improve Capacity Planning for Inpatient Beds</br><br>Author: Asli Ozen, PhD student, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 160 Governors Drive, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, aslozen@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hari Balasubramanian</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In hospitals nationwide, misaligned bed capacity results in ED crowding and PACU holds. We used patient admission rates, surgery schedules, bed placement rules, length of stays and capacity information from Baystate Medical Center (Springfield, MA) to develop computer based optimization and simulation model to improve capacity allocation of inpatient beds. Our goal is to provide guidelines on how hospitals should manage their inpatient bed capacity in the presence of demand and LOS variability.</br>
