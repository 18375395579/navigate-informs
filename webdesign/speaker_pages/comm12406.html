Title: Optimizing the Dose and Delivery of Influenza Vaccine Using A Multi-Objective Simulation Approach<br>Author: Wei Bao, Graduate Assistant, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering, Fayetteville, Ar, 72701, United States of America, weibao@email.uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shengfan Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a multi-objective simulation optimization model to determine the number of doses and delivery of influenza vaccine before seasonal influenza outbreaks. The demand and timing for flu shots is uncertain, especially for areas with high risk of infection. We develop a simulation model for an optimal vaccine production and delivery policy considering three different perspectives: individual, society and vaccine manufacture.
