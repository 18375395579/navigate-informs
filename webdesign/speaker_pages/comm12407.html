We study choice set generation, the first step in developing a route choice model. A routing policy is the elementary alternative where online adaptation is imbedded in its definition.  Two real life networks from Stockholm and Singapore are used. Link travel time distributions are generated from taxi GPS data.  The quality of the choice sets is evaluated based on coverage and adaptiveness.</br>
