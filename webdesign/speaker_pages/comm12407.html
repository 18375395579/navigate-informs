Title: Choice Set Generation for Adaptive Route Choice Models in Large Scale Networks<br>Author: Song Gao, University of Massachusetts, 214C Marston Hall, 130 Natural Resources Rd, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, sgao@engin.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jing Ding, He Huang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Adaptive route choice models capture travelers' adaptation to real-time traffic information. We study choice set generation, the first step in developing a route choice model. A routing policy is the elementary alternative where online adaptation is imbedded in its definition.  Two real life networks from Stockholm and Singapore are used. Link travel time distributions are generated from taxi GPS data.  The quality of the choice sets is evaluated based on coverage and adaptiveness.
