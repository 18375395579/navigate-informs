Title: Incentive-compatible Distributed Routing<br>Author: Michael Schapira, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel, mikesch@cs.huji.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Aviv Zohar, Hagay Levin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a game-theoretic model of interdomain routing in today's Internet. The model enables complex dynamic interactions between the agents (asynchronous, sequential, and based on partial-information). We provide realistic conditions that guarantee that greedy and myopic behaviour is in the best interest of each of the players.
