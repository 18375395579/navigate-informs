Title: Solution Framework for Hurricane Evacuation Planning and Management<br>Author: Tiravat Assavapokee, Assistant Professor, University of Houston, 4800 Calhoun Street, Houston, TX, 77204, United States of America, Tiravat.Assavapokee@mail.uh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shabnam Zangeneh, MohammadReza Baharnemati, Gino Lim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This work presents the solution framework for emergency evacuation planning by utilizing mathematical models and heuristics algorithms. The framework utilizes network optimization techniques and efficiently generates evacuation routes and schedules based on the forecast information. This framework is expected to provide an intelligent systematic methodology that can be used by transportation planners and emergency management agencies to improve traffic management during hurricane evacuation
