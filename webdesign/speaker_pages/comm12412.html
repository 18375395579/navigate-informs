Title: An Economic Sequential Probability Ratio Test (ESPRT) Model to Detect Epidemic Outbreaks<br>Author: Dayna Martinez-Torres, Graduate Student, University of South Florida, 4401 St Lucia Court, Apartment 8, Tampa, Fl, 33613, United States of America, dlmartin@mail.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jose Zayas-Castro, Tapas Das<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present an Economic Sequential Probability Ratio Test model designed to enhance surveillance ability of early warning systems for epidemic outbreaks. The model considers the costs of false alarm, detection delay, and cost to society. Epidemiological models are developed for each cost and the total cost is optimized to obtain the surveillance parameters.
