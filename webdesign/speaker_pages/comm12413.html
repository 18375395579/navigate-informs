Title: A New Moment-based Method for Combining Heterogeneous Statistical Findings<br>Author: Mohammad S. Jalali, PhD student, Virginia Tech, Falls Church, VA, United States of America, mj@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kamran Paynabar, Hazhir Rahmandad<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Currently meta-analysis and meta-regression are used for aggregating effect sizes from different studies. These methods are limited to homogeneous statistical studies with same design and independent and dependent variables. We introduce a new approach for aggregating statistical estimates coming from heterogeneous studies with different designs and functional transformations. We show the utility of the method by examples of extracting unbiased parameter values from biased regression results.
