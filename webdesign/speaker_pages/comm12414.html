<br>Title: A Shadow Price Framework for Quantifying Health Care Spending and Discrimination</br><br>Author: Chris P. Lee, Assistant Professor, The Wharton School, Univ. of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut St., Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, cpclee@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Glenn Chertow, Stefanos Zenios</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Has health care spending become excessive? What is your life worth? Does the health care system discriminate based on race? Researchers have tried to address these questions empirically. We take on an alternative approach and use a large-scale, population-based optimization model coupled with observed data to answer these questions.</br>
