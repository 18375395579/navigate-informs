Title: Economic Design for Individual Measurements, Motivated by Models of Flu Activity<br>Author: Justin Chimka, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering, Fayetteville, AR, United States of America, jchimka@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jia Zhou<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Consider situations in which the sample used for process monitoring consists of an individual unit. Our motivation comes from gamma regression model-based control charts for flu activity, where individual units are absolute values of residuals. We have developed probability statements for computing true errors associated with individuals control charts of continuously distributed measurements. Assuming simple cost functions, we have searched for and discovered economic designs.
