<br>Title: Identification of Nonlinear Causality for Prediction Based on Network Graph</br><br>Author: Akkarapol Sa-ngasoongsong, Ph.D Candidate, Oklahoma State University, 245N. University Place, Apt.301, stillwater, ok, 74075, United States of America, akkarap@ostatemail.okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The concept of Granger-Causality has been broadly regarded as a powerful method, and widely used in time series research to determine a predictability of one variable to the others. However, one of the limitations of Granger-Causality is linearity assumption. In this presentation, we introduce a methodology to identify causal relationship of variables based on nonlinearity assumption and graph theory. A prediction application using nonlinear causality graph is also presented.</br>
