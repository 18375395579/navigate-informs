Title: An Exact Solution for Nested Fare RM Problem Using Phase-Type Distributions<br>Author: German Riano, Assistant Professor, Universidad de los Andes, Calle 19 No 1-37 E, Bogot? DC, Colombia, griano@uniandes.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): Laura Vielma<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper, we present an algorithm to obtain the optimal booking limits for a nested fare classes Revenue Management problem, without the use of Monte Carlo simulation. The algorithm is based on a new closure property of Phase-Type distributions. The use of Phase-Type distributions does not limit the applicability of the model, since this set of distributions is shown to be dense on the real line, and, therefore, it can approximate any data trace.
