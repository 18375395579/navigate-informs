<br>Title: Dynamic Learning and Optimization with Operational Statistics</br><br>Author: George Shanthikumar, Professor, University of California at Berkeley, Department of IEOR, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, shanthikumar@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andew Lim, Zuo-Jun Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Consider a stochastic system characterized by a parametric model with unknown parameters. The classical approach is to assume that parameters are known, find the optimal policy, and implement it using estimated values for parameters. When data available is limited, or the underlying uncertainty is nonstationary, these policies may not perform well. We use Operational statistics to find the optimal policies directly from the data. Inventory control and dynamic auctions are considered.</br>
