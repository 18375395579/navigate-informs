Title: A Clinical Decision Tool for Predicting Patient Care Characteristics<br>Author: Eva Lee, Professor and Director, Industrial and Systems Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, eva.lee@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fan Yuan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This work is joint with Grady Memorial Hospital and the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. We focus on on identifying reasons behind the recurrence of patient admissions, and designing classification models to predict potential readmissions.Large scale data analysis and results will be presented. This is critical given the Affordable Care Act is beginning to implement readmission penalties. The algorithmic approach could detect readmission triggers without human monitoring.
