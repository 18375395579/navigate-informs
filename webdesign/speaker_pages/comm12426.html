Title: Incentive to ride? A Queueing Model of Emergency Medical Transportation with Imperfect Information<br>Author: Alex Mills, Assistant Professor, Indiana University Kelley School of Business, 1309 E Tenth St, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, millsaf@indiana.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Ambulances responding to 9-1-1 calls can provide many services, but ambulance agencies are often reimbursed only for actually transporting a patient to a hospital. Medically unnecessary transports are costly and result in congestion at the ED. We use a queueing model to study the effect of reimbursement policy on transportation decisions when the ambulance service uses predictive analytics. We show that incentives can be realigned to reduce cost and congestion in the emergency medical system.
