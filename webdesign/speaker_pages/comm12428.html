Title: National Airspace System (NAS) Flow Analysis Model<br>Author: Nastaran Coleman, Sr. OR Analyst, Federal Aviation Adminstration, 800 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC, 20591, United States of America, nastaran.coleman@faa.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Marc Rose<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Modeled NAS including all its airports, fixes and routes as a network.  Determined NAS capacity, i.e. maximum number of  aircraft traveling using the Max Flow algorithms. This model can be used to evaluate potential benefits or disadvantages of various natural and artificial interventions such as reducing en-route separation standards, increasing airport capacities, utilizing regional airports, smoothing traffic, and disruptive weather phenomena.
