<br>Title: Adaptability to Hospital Information Systems: The Missing Link in Healthcare Quality Improvement?</br><br>Author: Roopa Raman, Emory University, 1300 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, roopa_raman@bus.emory.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Quality improvement via clinical information systems requires the ability to adapt the day-to-day practice of clinical care with these technologies. In a multi-method study, conducted via socio-metric surveys and multiple-case studies in a large urban hospital, I seek to understand how hospital units can successfully adapt to technology-induced change. Two complementary frameworks, social networks and organizational routines, are used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.</br>
