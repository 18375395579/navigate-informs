Title: On Estimating Quantile Sensitivities via Simulation<br>Author: Guangxin Jiang, Tongji University, 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai, 200092, China, divi-msn@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Fu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a simple framework for estimating quantile sensitivities by infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA). We also consider the likelihood ratio (LR) and weak derivative (WD) methods, and discuss the strengths and weakness of each method.  Simulation experiments are used to compare the performances of the three methods.
