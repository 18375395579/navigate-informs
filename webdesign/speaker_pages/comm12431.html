Title: Agent-based Modeling and Simulation ?Overview and Tutorial<br>Author: Charles Macal, Senior Systems Engineer, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S. Cass Avenue, Bldg 221 - DIS, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States of America, macal@anl.gov<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a new approach to modeling systems comprised of autonomous, interacting agents. Applications are growing rapidly in fields ranging from modeling the stock market to predicting the spread of epidemics.  Complex adaptive systems, emergent behavior, and self-organization are a few of the notions from ABMS. This tutorial covers the foundations of ABMS, development toolkits and methods, practical aspects, and the relationship of ABMS to conventional OR.
