Title: Robust Revenue Management with Dynamic Budgets of Uncertainty<br>Author: Aurelie Thiele, P.C. Rossin Assistant Professor, Lehigh University, 200 W. Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, aut204@lehigh.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present an approach to dynamic pricing with imperfect demand information based on robust optimization techniques and the sequential update of a budget of uncertainty, whose initial value quantifies the decision-maker’s risk aversion. At each time period the manager decides whether to use some of his budget to protect against present uncertainty or to keep it for later use. We connect our results with traditional dynamic programming and the optimal pricing strategy in that framework.
