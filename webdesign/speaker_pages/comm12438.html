Title: Modeling and Solving the Problem of Evacuating Transit-dependent Citizens During No-notice Disasters<br>Author: Sandra Eksioglu, Assistant Professor, Mississippi State University, PO Box 9542, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, United States of America, sde47@ise.msstate.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Public transit system can be used during no-notice disasters to evacuate transit-dependent citizens to safety. This paper describes a framework to model the problem, and presents a Tabu search approach to identify routes for transit vehicles. The objective is to maximize the number of transit dependent citizens evacuated within a short time-frame. The traffic network of the city of Fort Worth, TX is used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework.
