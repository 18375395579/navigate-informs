We scaled participant’s individually-selected probability phrases and developed a model that predicts choice probabilities by using the scaled meanings as proxies for confidence distributions associated with sampling from memory. Predictions were sustained for 34 of 41 participants. The results have both theoretical and applied implications.</br>
