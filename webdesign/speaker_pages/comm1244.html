Title: Evaluating Influence Diagrams Using Decision Circuits<br>Author: Debarun Bhattacharjya, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Center, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, debarunb@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ross Shachter<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We introduce decision circuits as a means to exploit the local  structure as well as the conditional independence found in decision  problems and to improve the performance of influence diagram analysis.  We build on the probabilistic inference algorithms using arithmetic  circuits to represent Bayesian belief networks as developed by  Darwiche.
