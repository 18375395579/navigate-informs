Title: Optimization of U.S. Army Battalion and Brigade Assignments<br>Author: Javier Salmerón, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, jsalmero@nps.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center is investigating the problem of determining the best future mix of brigade combat teams (BCTs).  Our optimization model examines how to assign individual battalion units and BCTs to missions over time in order to maximize the fit of those assignments across the force.  The model accommodates the current Army Force Generation cycle for both active and reserve components.  The study has been used to inform Army leadership decisions.
