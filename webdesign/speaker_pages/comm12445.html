Title: Dynamic Assignment of Cross-trained Agents Providing On-demand Services<br>Author: Mark Van Oyen, Assoc. Professor, University of Michigan, Industrial and Operations Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States of America, vanoyen@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abhijit Bose, Hoda Parvin, Hyun-soo Ahn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We report on a problem of dynamic assignment of cross-trained agents in an environment of on-demand technical support services. The general, high-fidelity model is intractable; however, stylized models, analysis, and heuristics are useful in developing effective policies for managing these systems. In addition to information technology delivery/support systems, this research is relevant to many domains including healthcare.
