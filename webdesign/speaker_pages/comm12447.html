Lin, University of California, ITS-Davis, zlin@ucdavis.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This research focuses on building an optimal transition model for future hydrogen infrastructure development.  Dynamic programming is used to model this large-scale multistage planning problem and a state-filter approach is exploited to reduce the dimensionality of this problem.  Policy implications are discussed using a case study in Beijing.</br>
