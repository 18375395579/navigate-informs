<br>Title: Introduction to the Reload Fleet Size Model</br><br>Author: Moncef Sellami, Manager Fleet Planning & Analysis, TTX Company, 101 N. Wacker Dr., 8th Flour, Chicago, IL, 60606, United States of America, Moncef_Sellami@ttx.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this presentation we show how to calculate a recommended Fleet Size using the Reload methodology.  Reload, a fleet management team within TTX Company, handles fleet sizing and daily distribution of empty multi-level auto-racks for railroads serving 17 automotive shippers.  The Reload methodology is based on static and dynamic fleet-sizing models along with appropriate correction factors to recommend the number of railcars of each car type that should be acquired for any model year.</br>
