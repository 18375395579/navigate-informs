<br>Title: Solving Beam Angle Selection and Dose Optimization Simultaneously via High-Throughput Computing</br><br>Author: Hao Zhang, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Industrial and Systems Engineering Dept., 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, haoz@cae.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Meyer, Leyuan Shi, Warren D'Souza</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this research we provide a framework for integrating two stages of Radiation Treatment Planning (RTP): Beam Angle Selection (BAS) and Dose Optimization (DO). A metaheuristic approach, Nested Partitions (NP), is applied. Computational efficiency is achieved by utilizing High-Throughput Computing (HTC) via the Condor system. Computational results show that our framework has led to a significant improvement in terms of solution quality and delivery time comparing with current clinic practices.</br>
