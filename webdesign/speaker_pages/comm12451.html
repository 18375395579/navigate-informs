<br>Title: Estimation of Mixtures of Continuous Distributions:  Mixtures of Normal and Applications</br><br>Author: Victoria Zdanovskaya, Research Assistant, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 303 Weil Hall, P.O.

This paper suggests computationally efficient methods for  constructing mixtures of distributions, based on the minimization of weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and CVaR-distance between CDFs of an empirical distribution and the mixture. A special attention is paid to fitting tails of the distribution. Proposed techniques are exemplified with fitting the distribution of an aircraft manufacturer errors.</br>
