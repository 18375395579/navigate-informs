We particularly focus on GPCFB’s VRP, which has not been studied before, and evaluate three different approaches to solve this problem: MIP-based column generation, exact CP-based model and heuristic CP- based model. Our computational results indicate that the heuristic CP-based model can yield substantial savings even when a small number of changes (locations) are considered.</br>
