Title: Food Banks Can Improve Their Operations with OR Tools<br>Author: Canan Corlu, Assistant Professor, Bilkent University, Industrial Engineering Dept, Ankara, Turkey, canan.corlu@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Willem-Jan van Hoeve, Sridhar Tayur<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this study we work with Pittsburgh Community Food Bank (GPCFB) to improve their operations. We particularly focus on GPCFB’s VRP, which has not been studied before, and evaluate three different approaches to solve this problem: MIP-based column generation, exact CP-based model and heuristic CP- based model. Our computational results indicate that the heuristic CP-based model can yield substantial savings even when a small number of changes (locations) are considered.
