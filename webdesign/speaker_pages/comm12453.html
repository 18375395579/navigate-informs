<br>Title: System Reliability Optimization by using Monte Carlo Simulation and a Metaheuristic Algorithm</br><br>Author: Krystel Castillo, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at San Antonio, One Circle UTSA EB 3.04.54, San Antonio, TX, 78249, United States of America, krystel.castillovillar@utsa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Harry Millwater, Ahmed Kibria, Eliseo Iglesias</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of allocating resources for inspection data acquisition for complex systems with multiple components and failure modes such as a military gas turbine engine.  A nested loop approach using is proposed to determine the system’s mean time to failure distribution and a metaheuristics was used to identify the optimal inspection data to be added at each subcomponent. This methodology can be applied to assess the economic impact of changing maintenance policies.</br>
