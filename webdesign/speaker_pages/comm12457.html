<br>Title: Input/Output Selection in DEA for Portfolio Optimization: Optimality Conditions and Solution Methods</br><br>Author: Xin Zhang, Assistant Professor, Austin Peay State University, School of Business, Clarksville, TN, 37043, United States of America, zhangx@apsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chanaka Edirisinghe</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper develops a framework for modeling input/output selection for DEA models of internal performance of a firm via an optimization of an external reward measure. First-order optimality conditions are derived and are used to develop solution algorithms. These local optimal solutions are further improved using theoretical properties of the global optimal solutions. The methodology is applied in financial optimization models to demonstrate the quality of the resulting portfolio selections.</br>
