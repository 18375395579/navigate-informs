Our forecasting  model uses novel statistical methodology from  the area of functional data analysis. It uses the entire trading  path rater than only its final value and it employs trading dynamics  and it teases out differences between different trading paths  using functional shape analysis.  Our results show that the model has strong predictive power  and improves over competitors.
