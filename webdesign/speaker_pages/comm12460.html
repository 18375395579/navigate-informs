We study the use of spies in 2-person matrix games.  We formulate the context of a spying in such games, and model a number of situations involving single or multiple types of spies, spies for one or both sides, and the use of decoy strategies to mislead spies.  Computational studies indicate the advantage of using spies under various scenarios.</br>
