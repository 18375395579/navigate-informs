Title: A Polytope Method for Efficiently Identifying Mean and Dispersion Effects<br>Author: Russell Cheng, Professor of Operational Research, University of Southampton, School of Mathematics, Highfield, Southampton, NA, SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom, rchc@maths.soton.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Ankenman, Susan Lewis<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider how to identify important factors influencing a response in a simulation experiment, where the number of factors is large and factors can affect both dispersions and means; the directions of the effects being known. We present a method using a polytope construction that efficiently makes use of all available information to estimate both dispersion and mean effects. Numerical examples are given showing its improved performance compared with sequential bifurcation.
