Title: A Data Mining Approach for Multivariate Statistical Process Control<br>Author: Thuntee Sukchotrat, University of Texas at Arlington, 500 W.First St.,?Box 19017,?420K Woolf, Arlington, TX, United States, tsukchotrat@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a data mining approach for multivariate statistical process control. By using classification techniques, our proposed method can utilize both the in-control and out-of-control data information to build a control chart. The probability that a data point belongs to a certain class from classification result is plotted.
