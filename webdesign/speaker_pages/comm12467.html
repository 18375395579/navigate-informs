Title: Mercado: From Business Customers to Service Providers<br>Author: Kivanc Ozonat, Hewlett Packard Laboratories, 870 E El Camino Real Apt. 169, Mountain View, CA, 94040, United States of America, kivanc.ozonat@hp.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Mercado project at HP Labs aims to provide business customers with the ability to discover, select from, utilize and combine services offered by (online) service providers. Given the large number and variety of service offerings, service providers and customer requirements, it is infeasible to accomplish the Mercado goals through manual processes. Instead, we use machine learning/data mining techniques to automate -as much as possible- discovery, selection and utilization stages of Mercado.
