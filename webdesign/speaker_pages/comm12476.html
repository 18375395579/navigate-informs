<br>Title: A Variable-Selection-based Multivariate EWMA Chart for Process Monitoring and Diagnosis</br><br>Author: Kaibo Wang, Associate Professor, Tsinghua University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Beijing, China, kbwang@tsinghua.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Jiang, Fugee Tsung</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Fault detection and root cause identification are both important tasks in Multivariate Statistical Process Control. This paper proposes a Variable-Selection-based MEWMA chart. The new chart first locates potentially out-of-control variables via variable selection, and then deploys such information in the monitoring statistics with the reduction in dimensionality providing increased sensitivity to out-of-control conditions. Its performance is studied via numerical simulations and real examples.</br>
