<br>Title: Airline Operations Control Modeling</br><br>Author: Goran Stojkovic, Jeppesen, 1800 McGill College Avenue, Suite 1930, Montreal, QC, H3A 3J6, Canada, goran.stojkovic@jeppesen.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Most airlines are organized in functional silos. The resulting fragmented processes prove suboptimal and can be costly, slow and inconsistent in operations. To provide an efficient holistic solution, we created the airline business process model that maps functional areas and processes. The developed model helps to measure efficiency, detect bottlenecks, create what-if scenarios and build robust, integrated mathematical models. Examples that highlight the value of our approach will be provided.</br>
