Mech., Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, chiu@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Debora Anjos, Young-Jun Son, Pitu Mirchandani, Mark Hickman, Brenda Bustillos, Yunemi Jang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This talk presents a recent study on a multi-resolution traffic simulation assignment approach that integrates the regional mesoscopic, microscopic traffic simulation and discrete event simulation models. Model calibration and validation were conducted through various data synthesis techniques such as license plate and remote sensing data. Preliminary analysis results on the POE operational reliability and policy scenarios are presented.</br>
