We use relative entropy and Alpha-divergence to quantify model risk, and convert expectation optimization problems into robust problems. We exam various financial models and their vulnerability to model risk, where we compare the nominal models, their worst scenarios and candidate perturbations. We find uncertainty in parameters inadequate to describe the worst scenarios in most cases.
