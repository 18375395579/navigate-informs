Title: Rough Sets Based Data Mining for Predicting Product Qualities of Nonlinear Process<br>Author: Zhihua Xiong, Prof., Tsinghua University, Dept. of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China, zhxiong@tsinghua.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Xiong Wang, Kai Jiao<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Rough set based data mining is proposed to predict product qualities in industrial process. Fuzzy c-mean method is used to preprocess data samples. Emergence frequency threshold of decision-making rule is introduced to adjust its confidence threshold. Compared with Apriori and neural network, it can distinguish significance of attributes effectively and immune from local minimum, so it can improve accuracy of product predictions. The proposed method is illustrated on an acetone refining process.
