Title: New Performance Measures for Multi-state System Reliability<br>Author: Kailash Kapur, Professor, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, kkapur@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Carlos Solorio Magana<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Most of the systems degrade over time and have multiple levels of performance. The traditional binary models are not realistic to capture the accurate level of performance of these systems. We present some new measures for system performance where the system and the components have multiple levels of performance. These measures combine traditional reliability measures in terms of probability with economics using utility theory from the viewpoint of the customer.
