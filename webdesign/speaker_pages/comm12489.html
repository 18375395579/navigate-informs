<br>Title: Reliability Analysis of Complex Systems Based on the Stochastic Order</br><br>Author: Demet Batur, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, CBA 209, Lincoln, NE, 68588, United States of America, dbatur@unl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fred Choobineh</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Survival functions provide an indication about the likelihood of survival beyond a specific time. The reliability of system designs, such as designs for telecommunication and electrical power systems, are compared based on their survival functions. The survival functions are often tractable only via simulation. Here a statistical sequential selection procedure is presented to compare the survival functions of simulated stochastic systems based on the stochastic order dominance.</br>
