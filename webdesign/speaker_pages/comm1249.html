Title: Robust Optimization Method for Combined Chemo/Radiation Treatment Planning<br>Author: Omid Nohadani, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, nohadani@purdue.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The treatment of cancerous tumors with external radiation is planned based on initial data and independent of other modalities, resulting in strategies that do not vary over the course of the treatment.  However,  the sensitivity of the tissue to radiation changes over time, particularly when chemotherapeutic agents are combined. Based on clinical cases, we demonstrate that robust plans account for temporal changes and are intrinsically insensitive to deviations from the assumed temporal path.
