Title: Models for Unconventional Warfare: Modeling and Analysis of the IED Threat<br>Author: Kathryn Laskey, Professor, George Mason University, SEOR Dept, 4400 University Dr, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, klaskey@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Loerch, Tod Levitt, Ronald Woodaman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Models of combat have a long tradition in analyses of conventional warfare, but research on quantitative models for unconventional warfare is still in its infancy.  Modeling of IED use requires representing interactions between the Coalition Forces, insurgent groups, the population, and the operational environment.  This paper describes models our integrative approach to modeling the IED threat, our results and findings, and the many challenges encountered.
