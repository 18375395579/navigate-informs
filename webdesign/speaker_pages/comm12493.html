Title: Bellman Equations Applied to Hurricane Decision Making<br>Author: Richard Larson, MIT, E40-231, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, rclarson@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Metzger<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: As a hurricane approaches the coastline, its state variables are updated periodically via satellite, airplane and other reconnaissance.  Each update represents a stage, a decision making epoch, in Bellman's parlance.  Stage-to-stage updates are uncertain, reflecting the probabilistic behavior of hurricanes.  We characterize on-shore decision-making within such a stochastic dynamic programming framework, and replay old hurricanes to demonstrate the utility of the approach.
