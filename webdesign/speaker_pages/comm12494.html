Title: Stochastic Portfolio Optimization under Regime-based Firm Strength Scenarios<br>Author: Chanaka Edirisinghe, Professor, University of Tennessee, 233 Stokely Management Center, 916 Volunteer Blvd, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States of America, chanaka@utk.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A stochastic optimization model under regime-switching market uncertainty is proposed to manage stock portfolios. Investments are selected based on relative firm strengths using quarterly financial statements, and consistent with specific regime scenarios. The regime-switching model is combined with the firm-strength metric to test the performance of a two-quarter stochastic programming model. The out-of-sample results are used to demonstrate the superiority of the methodology.
