Title: Object Oriented GAMS API: .NET and Beyond<br>Author: Michael Bussieck, GAMS Development, 1217 Potomac Street NW, Washington, DC, 20007, United States of America, mbussieck@gams.com<br>Coauthor(s): Lutz Westermann<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The object oriented GAMS API provides the possibility of controlling  GAMS from within different programming languages like C#, Java and  Python which, for example, offers a seamless integration of GAMS into  .NET based applications. The powerful in-memory representation of a  GAMS model can increase performance when solving a model multiple  times with slightly changed data by performing the model creation only  once.
