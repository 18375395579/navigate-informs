Title: Designing LTL Load Plans to Mitigate Impact of Transit Time Variability<br>Author: Yu Zhang, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, 30339, United States of America, zhangyu@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Erera<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a method to design robust load plans for LTL carriers in order to mitigate the cost impacts of transit time variability. Load plan candidates are generated based on optimizing operations assuming that transit times take expected values, and then evaluated and refined by Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed method is applied to a case study which is built based on terminal and shipment data from a national LTL carrier.
