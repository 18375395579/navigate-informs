<br>Title: Gurobi Presolve</br><br>Author: Robert Bixby, CEO and President, Gurobi Optimization Inc., 3733-1 Westheimer Rd., Houston, TX, United States of America, bixby@gurobi.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zonghao Gu, Ed Rothberg</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Presolve refers to that step before solution of an optimization model in which an attempt is made to simplify a model.   For LPs these simplifications remove “extraneous?parts of the model, but for MIPs  the changes can be more fundamental, producing a strengthened model, and this strengthening can make the difference between a model being solvable and hopeless.  We will examine Gurobi presolve, including the effects of some of the more interesting new reductions.</br>
