Title: Quantifying and Modeling Risks of Food Imports<br>Author: Vicki Bier, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Room 3270A, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, bier@engr.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Welburn, Steven Hoerning<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We quantify risks in imported foods using data on food import violations from the FDA. We find that the rate of import violations per volume is a useful indicator of import risk. Furthermore, we model food import risk as a function of country of origin, product type, and key economic indicators using regression analysis. The results elucidate both product & country risks, and indicate that import risk is significantly related to both product type and economic status of the country of origin.
