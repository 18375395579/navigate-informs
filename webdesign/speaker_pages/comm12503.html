<br>Title: Learning Asymmetric Forecast Preference: Models and Empirical Study</br><br>Author: Mengshi Lu, PhD Student, University of California at Berkeley, Department of IEOR, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, mengshi@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pin Ng, Kemal Guler, Z. Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Forecasters typically have asymmetric preference towards underforecast and overforecast. We present inverse and robust optimization models for recovering such asymmetry from historical forecast data. Simulated numerical study shows that our models are able to recover the true asymmetric preference efficiently. We then use the models to study the Federal Reserve's economic growth forecast and forecast sharing in a PC manufacturing supply chain.</br>
