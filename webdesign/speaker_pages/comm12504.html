To improve their mechanical properties, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is added during the manufacturing process.  We present a multi-resolution model for analysis and prediction of Young’s modulus of PVA-treated BPs. We utilize data from both the physical experiment and a simulation model. Introducing a latent variable which reflects the effectiveness of the PVA, we develop an algorithm which aggregates both sources of information.</br>
