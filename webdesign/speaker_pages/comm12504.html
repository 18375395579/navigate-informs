Title: Multi Resolution Analysis for Modulus Prediction of PVA Treated Buckypaper<br>Author: Arash Pourhabib, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, arash.pourhabib@neo.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding, Jianhua Huang, Kan Wang, Chuck Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Buckypapers (BPs) are thin sheets produced from carbon nanotubes. To improve their mechanical properties, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is added during the manufacturing process.  We present a multi-resolution model for analysis and prediction of Young’s modulus of PVA-treated BPs. We utilize data from both the physical experiment and a simulation model. Introducing a latent variable which reflects the effectiveness of the PVA, we develop an algorithm which aggregates both sources of information.
