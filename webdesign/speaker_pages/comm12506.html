Box 4288, Incline Village, NV, 89450, United States, dfylstra@frontsys.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This talk will describe and demonstrate support for Probability Management in Risk Solver software for Excel. We’ll show how Stochastic Libraries can be generated via Monte Carlo simulation and stored, and how they are used in models as uncertain variables; how to create and publish Certified Distributions, based on either analytic probability distributions or Stochastic Libraries, that are easy for end user modelers to use; and how models can be tested for ‘Certified?and ‘Coherent?properties.</br>
