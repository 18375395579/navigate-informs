Evans</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we propose a near optimum design for the receiving area of the largest warehouse of The Defense Logistics Agency located in New Cumberland, PA. We develop a simulation based optimization model using OptQuest in ARENA 13.9 software. In the optimization model, we aim to optimize the number of workers required in the induction stations. The performance measure of the system is considered as the average cycle time of a material type having high priority in process.</br>
