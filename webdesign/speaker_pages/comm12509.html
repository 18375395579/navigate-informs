Title: Rare Event Simulation for Portfolio Default Losses<br>Author: Xiaowei Zhang, HKUST, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, xiaoweiz@ust.hk<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We use a self-exciting point process L(t) to model the default losses of a portfolio. Fixing the time horizon t, we develop an importance sampling (IS) simulation for estimating P(L(t)>x), i.e. the probability that the portfolio suffers a large default loss before time t. We will show that this IS scheme achieves a significant variance reduction compared to plain Monte Carlo simulation.
