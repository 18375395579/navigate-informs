<br>Title: MEMS-based Prognostic & Health Management Solution for Internal Combustion Engines</br><br>Author: Kelly Lowder, Mathematician, Sandia National Laboratories, PO BOX 5800, MS 1011, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States of America, kslowde@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Martin, Justin Ford, Vince Hietala, Clint Furrer</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: First year results are presented of research to develop hardware and software to support time-to-failure (TTF) predictions for internal combustion engines.  A long-life battery-powered sensor wireless relays vibration measurements and in-situ IR spectroscopy on oil.  Novel algorithms use the combined sensor info to determine point estimates and uncertainty bounds for TTF and probabilistic estimates of likely failure modes.  A highly reliable monolithic silicon end-state is sought.</br>
