Title: The Number of Slots to Submit to Market Mechanisms<br>Author: David Lovell, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, 1173 Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, lovell@eng.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Churchill, Michael Ball, Avijit Mukherjee<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a sequence of three integer programming models to determine the appropriate number of arrival slots to allocate per time period at a slot-controlled airport whose slots are exchanged in a competitive market, e.g. an auction.  The models differ in their economic assumptions, calibration requirements, and computational complexity.  We offer some recommendations for calibration and show sensitivity analysis for important parameters.
