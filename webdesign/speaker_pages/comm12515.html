Title: Schedule Analysis and a Duty Partition Model for Crew Scheduling<br>Author: Ellis Johnson, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, ejohnson@isye.isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Barry Smith, Chunhua Gao<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Two schedule analysis methods are proposed to evaluate the crew friendliness of a schedule and suggest improvements. Based on schedule analysis, a duty partition model is proposed for the crew pairing problem. Duties are defined as decision variables. The duty network incorporates legalities for pairings. It can quickly find reasonably good pairing solutions. Possibilities of extending this model to achieve robust planning and integrated planning with fleet assignment are discussed.
