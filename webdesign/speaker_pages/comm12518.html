Title: Pricing American Options By Numerical Replication: Quadratic Programming Approach<br>Author: Timofey Turko, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, jk13@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Valeriy Ryabchenko, Stan Uryasev<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Quadratic programming approach is considered for pricing American options in an incomplete market. The algorithm replicates an option by a portfolio consisting of the underlying security and a risk-free bond. To make the model robust we incorporate a set of American option specific monotonicity constraints that are theoretically justified for general price dynamics processes. We populate the model with historical sample paths of the underlying security or with Monte Carlo simulated paths.
