Title: Analysis of Optimization Experiments<br>Author: James Delaney, Visiting Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Baker Hall 132B, Department of Statistics, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, United States of America, jdelaney@stat.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Roshan Josep Vengazhiyil<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: For the purposes of analyzing optimization experiments, we propose methodology using the practical significance level, which is a quantity that a practitioner can easily specify. We also propose utilizing empirical Bayes estimation which accounts for the randomness in the observations. Interestingly, the mechanics of statistical testing can be viewed as an approximation to empirical Bayes estimation, but with a significance level in the range of 15--40%.
