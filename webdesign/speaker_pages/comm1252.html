<br>Title: Quantile Modeling for Wallet Estimation</br><br>Author: Claudia Perlich, Researcher, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Route 134, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, perlich@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: customer’s purchasing power. We formalize the notion of customer wallet and present several new predictive modeling approaches that estimate the unobserved customer wallets in a quantile regression framework. The objective is to estimate a quantile of the conditional distribution of the response, rather than the mean. We survey some of the traditional approaches for quantile modeling and propose adaptations of nearest-neighbor and regression-tree approaches to quantile modeling.</br>
