<br>Title: Is it Really Jackson? Evidence-based Design of Queues & Modeling Transplant Waiting Times</br><br>Author: Donald Lee, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Center #494, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, dkklee@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chris P. Lee, Stefanos Zenios</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In simulating critical systems such as organ allocation policies, parametric models like Jackson networks may not be accurate enough. We introduce a method for inferring the actual arrival process and service rates of a queuing system from data to enable accurate modeling. Instead of using customer classes to capture heterogeneity in arrivals and transitions, we work at the finest resolution by predicting individual customer behavior based on a set of covariates associated with each client.</br>
