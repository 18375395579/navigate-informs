Title: Queuing Models of Case Managers<br>Author: Fernanda Campello de Souza, PhD Student, University of Alberta, 9917 110 Street, apt 1201, Edmonton, AB, T5K 2N4, Canada, campello@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Shumsky, Armann Ingolfsson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Many service systems use case managers who have repeated interactions with each customer until service is completed (e.g., emergency department doctors, social workers). We propose a stochastic model of a case manager system and formulate models that provide performance bounds for the system. We examine interactions among system parameters, including the impact on system performance of setting case-load limits. We also investigate heuristics for setting these limits.
