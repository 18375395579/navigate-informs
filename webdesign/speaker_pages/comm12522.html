Title: An Architecture for Hybrid Reasoning in Risk Analysis<br>Author: John Ambrosiano, Technical Staff Member, Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS 603, Los Alamos, NM, 87545, United States, ambro@lanl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Randy Roberts<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Risk analysis has changed considerably. The complexity of systems under consideration is very high, often requiring simulations to predict consequences. The nature of uncertainty has broadened to include vagueness and ignorance as well as random variation. This often exceeds the traditional scope of probabilistic risk assessment. We present a hybrid architecture for risk assessment able to combine diverse methods like probability, approximate reasoning, and simulation within the same framework.
