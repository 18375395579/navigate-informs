<br>Title: A Failure-time Prediction Method for Condition-based Maintenance</br><br>Author: Arda Vanli, Assistant Professor, Florida State University, 2525 Pottsdamer St., Tallahassee, Fl, 32310, United States of America, avanli@fsu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes a Bayesian approach for failure time prediction of degrading components from condition data that accounts for uncertainties and incorporates prior information on degradation behavior. The approach is based on posterior sampling to handle more general statistical models. It is illustrated with simulation that by incorporating condition monitoring data or including prior knowledge the effectiveness of maintenance decisions can be significantly improved.</br>
