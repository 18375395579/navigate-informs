<br>Title: Optimal Information Acquisition Policies: Application to HCV Screening</br><br>Author: Lauren Cipriano, Assistant Professor, Western University, Ivey Business School, London, ON, Canada, lcipriano@ivey.uwo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shan Liu, Thomas Weber, Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Standard practice for value of information analyses does not include the option to delay information collection. We demonstrate that when parameters vary across cohorts, as with hepatitis C (HCV) screening, the optimal information collection policy, for both time-varying and static parameters, may be to delay information collection. We apply our dynamic programming framework to identify the optimal information collection policy for three critical parameters in the evaluation of HCV screening.</br>
