Title: Bilevel and Trilevel Models for Electric Power Grid Interdiction and Defense<br>Author: Javier Salmeron, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Dept., Monterey, CA, 93933, United States, jsalmero@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Wood<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe defender-attacker-defender (DAD) models for protecting an electrical power grid physical infrastructure.  We first discuss the attacker-defender (AD) problem as one of interdiction: Use limited attacks on system components to maximize energy disruption. The DAD model uses limited defensive resources to protect components: We interdict the interdictor.  We discuss decomposition techniques to solve realistic electric power-transmission instances of AD, and smaller instances of DAD.
