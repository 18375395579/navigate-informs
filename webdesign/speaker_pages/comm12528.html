Title: A Risk-averse Dynamic Inventory Model with Fluctuating Purchasing Costs<br>Author: Sungyong Choi, Assistant Professor, Yonsei University, 1 Yonseidae-gil, Wonju, 220-710, Korea, Republic of, sungyongchoi@gmail.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In my work, dynamic consumption models are studied for finite and infinite time Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems with fluctuating purchasing costs. I use additive general and exponential utility functions with finite and infinite time horizons. In addition, we assume that purchasing costs follow a discrete-state Markov chain. Then, I consider parametric sensitivity analysis for the model parameters using super-modularity.
