Title: Design Incentives, Fairness and Cost Efficiency: A Network Perspective on EPR<br>Author: Luyi Gui, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, luyi.gui@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Atalay Atasu, Beril Toktay, Ozlem Ergun<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool that stipulates the financial responsibility of producers for post-use handling of their products. In this research, we provide an analytical assessment of the potential of the widely-adopted collective EPR implementations for providing design incentives and generating economic benefits for the involved stakeholders via designing cost allocation mechanisms, using a network model of e-waste collection and recycling operations.
