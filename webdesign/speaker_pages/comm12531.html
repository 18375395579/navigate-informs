An essential problem in many studies is that some of the risk factors are measured with error, which typically leads to biased effect estimates of relative risk and invalid tests of statistical significance. We propose a new, computationally usable, methodology for the analysis of survival data with risk factors subject to measurement error and nonlinear log hazard function.</br>
