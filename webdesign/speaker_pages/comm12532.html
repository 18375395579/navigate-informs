Title: Management of Logistics Planning<br>Author: Bjørnar Aas, Molde University College, Britvegen 2, Molde, 6402, Norway, bjornar.aas@himolde.no<br>Coauthor(s): Stein W. Wallace<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a conceptual framework for management of logistics planning. Logistics problems are gradually becoming more complex and the proposed framework contributes to a better understanding of logistics management as a subject. We believe that the application of the proposed framework could lead to more cost-efficient logistics planning. A case study from the oil-and gas industry is presented.
