Title: Applying Risk and Decision Analysis to Nuclear Nonproliferation Strategy<br>Author: David Caswell, Stanford University, 2247 Oak Hills Dr, Pittsburg, CA, 94565, United States of America, dcaswell@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elisabeth Pat?Cornell<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss ongoing research on applying risk and decision analysis techniques for assessing strategic options to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  We examine a multi-tier model for addressing the problem which enables a probabilistic modeling of a country’s nuclear weapons program along with a meta-model for assessing policy impact.
