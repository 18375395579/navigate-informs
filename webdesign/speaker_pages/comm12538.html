It is common nowadays to dynamically record usage and other environmental variables (e.g., temperature and humidity). We introduce a class of models for analyzing degradation data with dynamic covariate. We use general path models with random effects to describe degradation paths. The proposed methods are illustrated with an application for predicting  life of organic coatings in a complicated dynamic environment.</br>
