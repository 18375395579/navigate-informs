Title: A Queuing Model of a Conveyor-based AMHS to Support Configuration Design of Semiconductor Wafer Fabs<br>Author: Dima Nazzal, Assistant Professor, the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems, University of Central Florida, 4000 Central Florida Blvd., Orlando, FL 32816, United States of America, dnazzal@mail.ucf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hector J. Carlo, Jesus Jimenez, Andy Johnson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This study proposes an analytical queuing model of a conveyor-based Automated Material Handling System (AMHS) to enable rapid capacity and configuration design of semiconductor wafer fabs. The goal of the study is to accurately estimate the work-in-process (WIP) on the AMHS and assess the system stability. Numerical examples demonstrate and validate the queuing model over a wide range of operating configurations. Results show that this model estimates expected WIP with reasonable accuracy.
