Title: Aircraft Boarding Strategies: A Simulation Study<br>Author: Massoud Bazargan, bazargam@erau.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Victor Cole, Juan Ruiz<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper simulates the boarding strategies in use today by major airlines. To properly simulate the boarding process, the simulation model accounts for passenger interferences, baggage stowage, and the passenger arrival rate. We applied our simulation model to study the AirTran Boeing 737-700 short haul aircraft. We looked at five major boarding strategies from random to the customary back to front. Our analyses identifies that the arrival rate has an effect on the total boarding time and that the reverse pyramid and window middle aisle were among the efficient boarding strategies.
