Title: A New Generalized Linear Model for Estimating Electric Power System Reliability<br>Author: Seth Guikema, Texas A&M University, Department of Civil Engineering, 3136 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, sguikema@civil.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeremy Coffelt<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk presents a new GLM model based on the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson probability density function. It demonstrates the use of this model for estimating the impacts of tree trimming on electric power system reliability. The results from the new model are compared to the results from more standard models such as the Poisson and Negative Binomial GLMs.
