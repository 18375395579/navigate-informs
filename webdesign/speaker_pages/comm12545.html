John, Professor, Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE), Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-1061, United States, richardj@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Heather Rosoff</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Anti-terror decisions should depend on the likelihood of terrorist actions.  We develop a methodology to estimate the likelihood of alternative actions for the rational terrorist using a random utility model constructed from assessments of proxy rational terrorists.  The random utility model includes assessments of uncertainty about terrorist attack outcomes and values, including terrorist attitudes toward risk and trade-offs among conflicting terrorist objectives.</br>
