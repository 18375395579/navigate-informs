Title: Modeling Multiple Objectives in Green Building Decision-making<br>Author: John F Dickson, University of Texas at Arlington, United States of America, john.dickson@mavs.uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pin Kung, Anthony Robinson, Victoria Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Green building seeks to improve building sustainability. A decision-making framework is presented that utilizes design and analysis of computer experiments to study the impact of building options on sustainability objectives. The QUick Energy Simulation Tool (eQUEST) is employed to evaluate building performance. Modeling of multiple objectives is achieved using treed regression and treed multivariate adaptive regression splines with the seemingly unrelated regressions method.
