Title: Long-short Portfolio Optimization with Discrete Asset Choice Constraints and Two Risk Measures<br>Author: Gautam Mitra, Distinguished Professor and Director, CARISMA-Brunel University/ Optirisk Systems, John Crank Building, Uxbridge, UB8 3PH, United Kingdom, gautam.mitra@brunel.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Diana Roman, Ritesh Kumar<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider long-short portfolio optimization in the presence of two risk measures: variance and CVaR and discrete asset choice constraints of (i) buy and sell thresholds (ii) cardinality restriction on portfolio positions. Our model improves upon the classic mean-variance model by controlling both portfolio variance and CVaR. Our long-short extension to the mean-variance-CVaR model incorporates industry practices regarding short decisions. We test models on real data from the FTSE 100 index.
