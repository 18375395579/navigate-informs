<br>Title: Disseminating Emergency Preparedness Planning Models as Automatically Generated Custom Spreadsheets</br><br>Author: Jeffrey W. Herrmann, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, College Park, MD, United States of America, jwh2@umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: When public health officials requested operations research models to help county health departments across the United States create plans for dispensing medications and vaccines, we developed capacity planning and queueing network models.  We then faced the challenge of distributing these models to a set of persons who have unknown experience with operations research techniques and no resources for acquiring and learning new software.  We decided to use spreadsheets, which eliminated the most significant obstacles.  To allow users to evaluate a wide variety of plans, we created a spreadsheet application that runs VBA macros to generate customized analytical models without the assistance of an OR professional.  Public health emergency preparedness planners can download the software from our web site.  Developing spreadsheets for this type of application is very different from end-user modeling and typical spreadsheet applications.</br>
