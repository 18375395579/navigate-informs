Title: Fast-time Simulation of the Benefits of the FAA’s Operational Evolution Partnership<br>Author: Joseph Post, Manager, Modeling and Simulation, FAA/ATO-P, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC, 20591, United States of America, Joseph.Post@faa.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Kimberly Noonan, John Gulding, James Bonn, Daniel Murphy<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The FAA uses computer models to quantify the impact of planned investments on the performance of the National Airspace System (NAS).  NASPAC, the principle system-wide model in use, is a discrete-event simulation which represents the NAS as a network of airport and airspace queues.  The authors present the results of a simulation study of the projected benefits to NAS users of the Operational Evolution Partnership (OEP), the Agency’s modernization plan.
