<br>Title: Variance Estimators for Simulation Based on Data Re-Use</br><br>Author: Dave Goldsman, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, sman@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Melike Meterelliyoz, Christos Alexopoulos, James Wilson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We perform extensive analytical and empirical evaluations of recently proposed estimators for the variance parameter of a  steady-state simulation output process. The estimators are based on functionals of standardized time series and take advantage of data re-use to outperform certain longstanding competitors.</br>
