Title: A Recursive Binary Partitioning Algorithm for Clustering Analysis<br>Author: Jihoon Kang, PhD Student, Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, joker404@korea.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Clustering analysis has been conducted to elicit nature groupings of the dataset without prior information about the sample class. In this study, we propose a new clustering algorithm that adopts recursive binary partitioning to achieve the best grouping of the dataset. Experiments with the simulation and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed algorithm.
