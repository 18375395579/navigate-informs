<br>Title: Discrete Event Simulation of Demand at PHEV Charging Stations</br><br>Author: Minting Xiao, University of Oklahoma, 202 W. Boyd St., Room 116, Norman, OK, 73019-0631, United States of America, mintingx@ou.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Salman Ahmed, Janet K Allen, Farrokh Mistree</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Discrete-event simulation is used to predict the demand for energy at a PHEV charging station. Ranges of demand are predicted based on historical projections and anticipated policy decisions and this information is used in the discrete event simulation. Further uncertainty is incorporated in the model based on expected fluctuations in charging at different times of day. The simulation of demand from one charging station can be then extended to the system of charging stations.</br>
