<br>Title: Using Cost-effectiveness Analysis to Help Design Phase III Clinical Trials</br><br>Author: Nick Bansback, Health Economist, Centre for Health Evaluation and Outcome Sciences, Vancouver, BC, Canada, nbansback@cheos.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aslam Anis, Alan Brennan, Hyon Choi, Roberta Ara</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Increasingly, successful drug development depends not only on regulatory approval, but also the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. We use a decision analytic model to determine the cost-effectiveness of statins in patients with rheumatoid arthritis based on a phase II study. Value of information analysis is performed to calculate the value of parameter uncertainty and inform on the design of the multi-centre follow up study.</br>
