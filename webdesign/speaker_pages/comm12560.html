Title: A Robust CVaR Portfolio Allocation Model Using Option Prices<br>Author: Luis Zuluaga, Assistant Professor, University of New Brunswick, PO Box 4400, Fredericton, NB, E3B 5A3, Canada, lzuluaga@unb.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Juan Vera, Javier Pena<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a novel linear programming portfolio allocation model in which worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is used as the risk measure. The worst-case CVaR is computed by considering underlying asset price probability distributions that replicate the observed prices of vanilla options.
