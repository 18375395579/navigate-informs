Title: Short-term Wind Power Forecasting with Spatio-temporal Correlation Estimation<br>Author: Zhi Zhou, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 South Cass Ave. Bldg 221, Lemont, IL, 60437, United States of America, zzhou@anl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Audun Botterud<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We enhance short-term wind power forecasting algorithms by considering temporal and spatial correlations of explanatory variables to capture the characterization of supply from wind resources across a large geographic area. A time-forward kriging predictor is modeled to estimate explanatory variables for a given look ahead time based on historical data in a predefined area, and then to predict the wind power output. The framework is tested on a real world dataset and compared to existing models.
