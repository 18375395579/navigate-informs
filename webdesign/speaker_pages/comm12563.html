<br>Title: Algebraic Graph Theoretic Approach for Data-driven Characterization of Nano-scale Surface Features</br><br>Author: Prahalad Rao, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, prahalad.rao@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam, Zhenyu (James) Kong, Adam Fields, Ranga Komanduri</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a spectral graph theoretic approach to characterize the morphology of surfaces finished using chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) processing to near-optical quality.The proposed method is based on transforming the surface topography data into a fully connected graph, and extracting spectral properties of the Laplacian of the graph as features. The resulting Eigen analysis correlates (p ~ 80%) well with surface defect density.</br>
