Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) provides perfusion maps that represent tissue function. Registering CT and MRI scans results in potentially uncertain perfusion data. We propose a robust optimization model that provides plans insensitive to this uncertainty. We use liver cancer cases to compare treatment plans obtained with and without using functionality information.</br>
