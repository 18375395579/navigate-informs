Title: Managing Uncertainty in Structure Functionality Using Robust Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning<br>Author: Victor Wu, PhD Student, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, vwwu@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Martha Matuszak, Marina Epelman, Mary Feng, Troy Long, Edwin Romeijn<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) maps patient geometry in radiation therapy treatment planning. Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) provides perfusion maps that represent tissue function. Registering CT and MRI scans results in potentially uncertain perfusion data. We propose a robust optimization model that provides plans insensitive to this uncertainty. We use liver cancer cases to compare treatment plans obtained with and without using functionality information.
