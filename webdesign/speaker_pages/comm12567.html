<br>Title: Prediction and Prevention of Disruptions in Supply Chain Networks</br><br>Author: Xin Chen, Assistant Professor, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, 3079 Engineering Building, Edwardsville, IL, 62026-1805, United States of America, xchen@siue.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The objective of this research is to apply the failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) and graph theory to predict and prevent disruptions in supply chain networks. A network may be disrupted due to node failures. A node represents a supplier, customer, or transportation route. This research applies graph theory to model supply chain networks and uses the FMECA to identify critical nodes. A case study of a construction supply chain is analyzed to validate the methodology.</br>
