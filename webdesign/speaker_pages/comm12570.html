Title: Continuous-time Dynamic System Optimum Model and Applications<br>Author: Rui Ma, Research Assistant, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street, JEC 5107, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, mar2@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuegang Ban<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose an optimal control formulation for the continuous-time dynamic system optimal problem. We also show how the proposed model can used to model emergency evacuation applications.
