Title: Multiobjective Optimization and RL for Identifying Optimal Emissions and Water Taxes in Electricity<br>Author: Ivan Saavedra, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 3200 North Cramer Street, Milwaukee, 53211, United States of America, saavedr9@uwm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vishnu Nanduri<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper we develop a stochastic game model to represent the electricity market bidding problem. We use reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to find the optimal bidding strategies for the generators. We develop a designed experiment to obtain the hypothetical combination of tax rates for water and CO2 to be used in the electric power market as inputs in the stochastic game model. For each tax rate combination studied, we solve a multi-objective OPF problem using SPEA.
