<br>Title: Using Large Data Analytics and Prognostics Simulation for Performance-Based Investment Decisions</br><br>Author: Norm Reitter, Advisor, Information Technology, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 329, 44th Street, Pittsburgh, PA, 15201, United States of America, reittern@ctc.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Investments in Army CBM aviation health monitoring devices to collect sensor data provide an opportunity to reduce supply chain costs through improved prognostic capabilities.  Gleaning useful prediction capability from these very large data sets requires robust experimentation and simulation to sufficiently test the benefits of these investments.  We use predictive algorithms to determine a combined risk of stock out and simulation methods to determine expected supply chain performance.</br>
