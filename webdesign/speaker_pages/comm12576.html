Title: Data Mining Scheduling Data: Identifying Best Practices<br>Author: Sigurdur Olafsson, Assistant Professor, Iowa State University, Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States, olafsson@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiaonan Li<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: To compliment traditional scheduling models, data mining can be used to discover new knowledge directly from production schedules that are created by expert schedulers. However, to achieve the full benefits only the best scheduling practices should be used. In this talk we show how to combine optimization and data mining to identify best practices from which new scheduling knowledge can be discovered.
