Title: Extensible Simulation Framework for Railyard Operations<br>Author: David Ciemnoczolowski, Union Pacific Railroad, DDCIEMNO@UP.COM<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Simulation provides an excellent framework for analyzing impacts  of operational rules, yard design, and service design.  Unfortunately,  railyard operations do not readily fit into the classic server/queue  network typically assumed in discrete-event simulation.  In this talk, we will outline an extensible simulation approach using plug-in modules to evaluate different control policies.
