Title: Extreme (X-) Testing with Binary Data and Applications to Reliability Demonstration<br>Author: Vijayan N. Nair, Professor, University of Michigan, Department of Statistics, Campus Box 1107, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, vnn@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Mease<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Traditional reliability demonstration plans require extremely large sample sizes. One solution to this problem is to test products under extreme conditions so that they are more likely to fail. This presentation develops a general framework for this type of extreme testing with binary data. The effects of testing on sample size and power of reliability demonstration plans are discussed. Several applications are used to illustrate the general usefulness of the approach.
