<br>Title: Signature Construction and Matching for Fault Diagnosis in Manufacturing Processes</br><br>Author: Shiyu Zhou, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1513 University Ave., Madison, WI, 53711, United States, szhou@engr.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nong Jin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a variation source identification method for manufacturing processes by assuming a linear model between the quality measurements and process faults. The variation source identification is achieved through testing of the common eigenspace between the fault signatures and the covariance matrix of the newly collected samples. A case study is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology.</br>
