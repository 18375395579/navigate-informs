Title: Updating Play Calling using Game Theory and Exploring Risk Behavior through Response Surface Methodology<br>Author: Jeremy Jordan, Air Force Institute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433, United States, jeremy.jordan@wpafb.af.mil<br>Coauthor(s): Sharif Melouk, Marcus Perry<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We utilize game theory within a framework for updating optimal decisions based on new, available information from the perspective of an offensive unit of a football team. A decision maker, such as a coach or quarterback, may change perceived optimal policy based on available knowledge of the opponent’s strategy. We apply utility theory to account for different risk preferences and response surface methodology to explore good risk strategies with which to approach each situation.
