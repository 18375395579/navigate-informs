This study focuses on accurately predicting in-hospital ICU patient mortality utilizing functional profile data. We demonstrate that a boosted trees ensemble model is well suited for the diverse data typologies present in ICU data and provides an interpretable and accurate model to aid clinical experts in critical ICU decisions.
