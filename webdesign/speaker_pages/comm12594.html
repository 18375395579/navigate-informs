<br>Title: A Risk Mitigation Model for Cyber-attacks to PMU Networks</br><br>Author: Seyedamirabbas Mousavian, PhD Candidate, Auburn University, 257 South Gay Street APT 201B, Auburn, AL, 36830, United States of America, szm0032@auburn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jorge Valenzuela, Jianhui Wang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The power grid is dependent on information and communication technologies for the integration of data collected by intelligent measurement devices such as phasor measurement units (PMU).  Recent studies have shown that the power grid has significant cyber vulnerabilities which could increase when PMUs are used extensively. In this research, a risk mitigation model is proposed to respond to cyber-attacks to PMU networks. We model the optimal response action as a mixed integer linear programming.</br>
