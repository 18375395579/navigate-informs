Title: Testing the Validity of a Demand Model: An Operations Management Perspective<br>Author: Omar Besbes, University of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street, 551 Jon M Huntsman Hall, Philadelphia, PA, United States, obesbes@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Assaf Zeevi, Robert Phillips<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Various studies in the statistics and econometrics literature develop methods to test the specification of a statistical model. However, a revenue manager is in general more interested in the effect that pricing or capacity control decisions have on the eventual profits (performance), rather than the validity of the demand model per se. We develop a framework and statistical test that addresses this question and illustrate it with the aid of an empirical data set.
