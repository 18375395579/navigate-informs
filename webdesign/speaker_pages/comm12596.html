Title: Determining Locations for Variable Message Signs in Urban Networks<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas, Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rouyu Liu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Variable message signs should be located to improve system-wide traffic conditions, yet their impact cannot be easily predicted due to drivers reacting in a user-optimal, rather than system-optimal, manner. This research uses a genetic algorithm to find effective solutions, using the cell transmission model to propagate traffic flow and a dynamic, bounded-rational equilibrium concept.
