The use of a discrete  search algorithm, the interval Branch&Prune (iBP), allows to enumerate all the possible solution of the problem. We will present recent extensiona to the iBP framework: (1) the use of Clifford Algebra to improve the discretization of distances defined as continuous intervals; (2) the introduction of pruning devices specific for molecules.</br>
