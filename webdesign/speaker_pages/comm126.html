Title: An Integrated Approach for Airline Flight Scheduling, Fleet Assignment, and Aircraft Routing<br>Author: Ki-Hwan Bae, Virginia Polytechnic and State University, 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, kbae04@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hanif D. Sherali, Mohamed Haouari<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a model that integrates certain aspects of the schedule design, fleet assignment, and aircraft routing processes, while considering various modeling features. Maintenance routing decisions as well as through-flight opportunities are additionally incorporated in our model, and we apply a series of different solution techniques to handle the large-scale model formulation, reduce its complexity, and enhance its solvability.
