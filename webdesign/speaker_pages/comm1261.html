Title: Study on Power Grid Defend-Attack-Defend with Line Switching<br>Author: Bo Zeng, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 E Fowler Ave ENB118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, bzeng@usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Yuan, Long Zhao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Defend-Attack-Defend (DAD) Models are widely used in power grid contingencies and security studies. In this study, we consider line  switching,  one of the most effective operations to mitigate deliberate outages or attacks, in DAD model. We evaluate the benefits of transmission line switching by comparing the case without line switching.
