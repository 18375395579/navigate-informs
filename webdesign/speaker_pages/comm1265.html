<br>Title: Dynamic-data-driven Adaptive Multi-scale Simulation for Control of Manufacturing Enterprises</br><br>Author: Nurcin Koyuncu, PhD Candidate, The University of Arizona, Systems and Industrial Engineering, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, koyuncu@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Young-Jun Son</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Our goal is to adaptively adjust the fidelity of a simulation model against available computational resources.  Four algorithms are embedded into a simulation model to perform data filtering, fidelity selection, fidelity assignment, and task generation.  Grid computing and Web Services are used for computational resources management and inter-operable communications among distributed software components.  The proposed approach is applied for control of distributed manufacturing enterprises.</br>
