We discuss how formal metamodels can incorporate risk-relevant information directly into business process models, and how those models can be transformed into quantitative models for estimating risk to process objectives.  Various  quantitative methods, including Bayesian networks and discrete-event simulation will be discussed, in the context of HR processes and IT infrastructure risk</br>
