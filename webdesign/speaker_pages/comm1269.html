Title: Automated Tuning of Solver Parameters<br>Author: Mustafa Baz, University of Pittsburgh, 5837 Hobart Street Apt. #2, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, mub3@pitt.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present automated tuning algorithms and implementations which determine good parameter settings for particular instances for MIP solvers. We compare several approaches using ideas from software testing and machine learning. Some of the ideas we use are pairwise testing, decision trees, and artificial neural networks.
