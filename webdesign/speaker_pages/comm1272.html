In this paper, we address the problem of attribution using a unique data set from an online campaign. We present a HMM of an individual consumer's behavior based on the concept of a conversion funnel. We observe that different ad formats, affect the consumers differently based on the state they are in. We also present an attribution scheme based on the proposed model.</br>
