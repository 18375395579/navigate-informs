<br>Title: A System Dynamics Resource Allocation Model of an Emergency Department</br><br>Author: Sonia Vanderby, Ph.D Candidate, University of Toronto, 438 Rickard Rd., Bowmanville, ON, Canada, sonia@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mike Carter</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Can SD be used to model an ED?  EDs have previously been modeled via DES, with little history of the use of SD.  A high-level simulation of an ED at The Ottawa Hospital was developed to test various scenarios requested by TOH.  The goal of the model is to provide hospital administrators with a tool to assist them with making long-term resource allocation decisions in an effort to reduce delays in the ED.  Scenario outcomes, as well as the pros and cons of SD in such a model are discussed.</br>
