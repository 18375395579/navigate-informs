Maltenfort<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Marine Corps has 35 different optics systems in its inventory and acquisition pipeline.  In this study, we develop two models: An Individual Optics (IO) Model based on Value Focused Thinking to evaluate similar optic systems; and, a Family Of Individual Optics (FOIO) Portfolio Model based on optimization that compares potential portfolios of optics for a rifle company and heavy machine gun platoon.
