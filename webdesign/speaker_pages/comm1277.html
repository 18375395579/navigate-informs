Title: Physical and Data-Driven Screening Systems for Security: Systems Analysis and Risks<br>Author: David Ortiz, RAND Corporation, 1200 South Hayes Street, Arlington, VA, 22202, United States, David_Ortiz@rand.org<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This presentation examines the limitations of networked systems to screen persons when presenting themselves at a controlled checkpoint.  We present a framework for evaluating the risk in networked screening systems using as examples the Transportation Security Administration’s Secure Flight system and the Department of Homeland Security’s US-VISIT program.  We show that all components of the systems can function as described, but that as a whole each system can fail to satisfy its goals.
