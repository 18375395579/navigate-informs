Title: Performance of Kanban Control Systems with Advance Demand Information<br>Author: Ananth Krishnamurthy, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, CII 5015, 110 8th Street, Troy, NY, United States, krisha@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kumar Satyam<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Analytical models are developed to analyze the effect of integrating advance demand information with kanban controlled pull systems. Queuing models based on parametric decomposition are used to evaluate the effect demand information lead times and base stock levels on performance measures such as flow times, inventory, and back order levels.
