In this study, we define the Stochastic Debris Clearance Problem (SDCP), where the debris amounts are partially known due to lack of data or information infrastructure. We propose a POMDP model and various heuristic approaches for SDCP. We also test the performance of these approaches and compare them to current practice using random instances and a potential disaster scenario.
