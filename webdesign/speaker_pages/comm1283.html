Engineering, Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States of America, sguikema@jhu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Terje Aven<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: There are many different conceptualizations of terrorism risk in use, and there is not yet agreement on a coherent framework for addressing terrorism risk. In this talk we give an overview of different ways of defining terrorism risk and the techniques used as measures of terrorism risk. We posit a framework that can help bring clarity to terrorism risk assessments.
