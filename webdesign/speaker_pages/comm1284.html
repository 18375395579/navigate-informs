The chart is based on counts between failures which can be modeled by a geometric distribution. A geometric based model is widely used for monitoring healthcare procedures. To detect a varying shift, we estimate the current failure rate and update the CUSUM statistic continuously. The simulation results show its potential to perform more effectively than other well-established methods.</br>
