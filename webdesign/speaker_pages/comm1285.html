<br>Title: Autoregressive Approach to Synchronization among Multiple Components of Complex Integrated System</br><br>Author: Alla Kammerdiner, ISE, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, alla.ua@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Maillart, Nagi Gebraeel</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A novel approach for studying synchrony in complex integrated systems is proposed based on multivariate statistical analysis by modeling cointegrated vector autoregressive processes. The method is illustrated by applying it to multichannel electroencephalogram recordings.</br>
