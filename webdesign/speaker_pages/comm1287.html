Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Tech, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, sman@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Healthcare management operates in an environment of aggressive pricing, tough competition, and rapidly changing guidelines. We show how computer simulation models can be used by healthcare institutions to meet these challenges. For example, we describe a low-cost, generic, discrete-event simulation model populated by a workflow observation Excel spreadsheet that can be completed by clinic staff themselves, thus “customizing?the simulation model for their own purposes.</br>
