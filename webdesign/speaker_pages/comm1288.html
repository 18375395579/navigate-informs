Title: IPOPT in a Software Package for Dynamic Optimization<br>Author: Yi-Dong Lang, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, lang@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andreas Waechter, Lorenz Biegler<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A software package, DynoPC, uses IPOPT as the NLP solver to solve discretized dynamic optimization problems simultaneously. It invokes ADOL-C to evaluate constraints, Jacobians and Hessians required by IPOPT, based on user-supplied models. The package has been updated according to new developments of IPOPT, and tested on challenging examples.
