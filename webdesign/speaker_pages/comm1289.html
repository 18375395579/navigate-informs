Title: Finding an Optimally Representative View<br>Author: Ray Strong, IBM Research Almaden, 650 Harry Rd, San Jose, CA, 95120, United States of America, hrstrong@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Neil Boyette, Sechan Oh, Anca Chandra, Jeanette Blomberg<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An analysis of the cost of service delivery is typically viewed in a reporting application, which allow various ways to filter and aggregate the data. Our system allows selecting one or more data points in a given view and finds the optimal combination of filters and aggregations to locate the likely causal explanation of this behavior. We use a segmented analysis of the original view to develop a score for each possible combination, as the usual branch & bound techniques do not apply.
