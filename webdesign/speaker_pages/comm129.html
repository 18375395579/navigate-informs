Title: Golf Handicap: A Moving Average of Moving Order Statistics<br>Author: Tom Spencer, Professor, Walden University, School of Management, United States, tspencer@waldenu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ivan Zorych<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A golf handicap can be viewed as a moving average of moving order statistics. A brief review of existing results based on the naïve assumption of i.i.d. normality of the generating sequence (i.e. your golf scores) will be given, along with a discussion of our simulations using a large multi-year data base of handicapped scores from an industrial Golf Tournament League.
