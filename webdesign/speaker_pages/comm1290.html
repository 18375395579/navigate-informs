Title: Robust and Semi-robust Network Design under Demand and Topological Uncertainty<br>Author: Siqian Shen, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 2793 IOE, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, siqian@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mingdi You<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We design robust/semi-robust networks for stochastic demand and topological parameters subject to independent uncertainty sets. Depending on how much data available, we minimize the maximum/expected losses by using robust/stochastic optimization models. The semi-robust approach employs SAA while bounding the maximum loss. Different cutting planes are developed to improve the computational efficacy.
