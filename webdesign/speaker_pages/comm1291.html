Title: Robust QFD Methodology under the Uncertainty in Input Information<br>Coauthor(s): Deok-Hwan Kim, Kwang-Jae Kim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In practice, the uncertainty in the input information of QFD is inevitable. This paper proposes an extended QFD methodology, called robust QFD, which considers the uncertainty of the input information and the resulting variability of the QFD output. The methodology consists of four phases ?uncertainty modeling, variability derivation, EC prioritization, Robustness evaluation and improvement. The methodology is demonstrated via a case study.
