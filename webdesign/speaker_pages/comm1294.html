Those signals are fitted into ARMA models and their vibration modes are analyzed. The relationship between the strength of one of the vibration modes and the amount of CNT clusters in the suspension is revealed by controlled experiments. An innovative online monitoring method for sonication of CNT suspension is developed based on this time series analysis.</br>
