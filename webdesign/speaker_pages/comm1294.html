Title: Time Series Analysis of Acoustic Signals during Sonication of Carbon Nanotube Suspension<br>Author: Kan Wang, Post-Doctoral Fellow, Georgia Institute of Technology, 813 Ferst Dr. NW RM 375, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, kan.wang@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chuck Zhang, Yung-Hang Chang, Jianjun Shi, Ben Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Acoustic signals are collected during sonication of carbon nanotube (CNT) suspension. Those signals are fitted into ARMA models and their vibration modes are analyzed. The relationship between the strength of one of the vibration modes and the amount of CNT clusters in the suspension is revealed by controlled experiments. An innovative online monitoring method for sonication of CNT suspension is developed based on this time series analysis.
