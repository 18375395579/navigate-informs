Title: Business Engineering: A Practical Approach to Valuing High-risk High-return Projects Using Real Options<br>Author: Scott Mathews, Assoc. Technical Fellow, The Boeing Company, PO Box 3707 MS 42-50, Seattle, WA, 98124, United States of America, scott.h.mathews@boeing.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jim Salmon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Options technology when applied within a corporation for strategic decision-making is called real options. These leading-edge risk and valuation mathematical methods more accurately determine effective investment strategies to reduce risk and shape project value outcome. A new airplane business case is used to illustrate various valuation techniques with modeling and simulation enhancements. Business engineering extends real options into systems engineering for comprehensive project management.
