Title: Building Prediction Models for Colorectal Cancer Mortality<br>Author: Leila Zia, Stanford University, United States of America, leilaz@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kim Rhoads, Margrét Bjarnadóttir<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We build prediction models for colorectal cancer mortality over a horizon of 30 days to 5 years after tumor diagnosis considering comprehensive medical, socio-economical, and hospital discharge data. We use two major California data-sets along with modern statistical methods such as classification trees and regularized logistic regression to find the most important predictors of colorectcal cancer mortality. We share insights which can help decision makers in the use of such prediction models.
