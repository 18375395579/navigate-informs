<br>Title: Command and Control Modeling for Air Traffic Flow Management</br><br>Author: Robert Hoffman, Principal Analyst, Metron Aviation, 131 Elden Street, Herndon, VA, 20170, United States, Hoffman@metronaviation.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In an effort to cope with air traffic demand growths and changing demand patterns, government and industry have developed simulation tools to model future concepts of air traffic management. We present a model for system-wide traffic flow management, which can be attached to existing simulation tools as a module. The model is multi-objective, considering efficiency, equity, and flexibility. Integer programs and network flow formulations are used to capture efficiency in the model.</br>
