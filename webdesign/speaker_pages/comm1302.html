Title: Wireless Vibration Sensor Array for Monitoring Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) Process<br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Associate Professor, School of Industrial Engineering & Management, Oklahoma State University, 322 EN, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States, bsatish@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ranga Komanduri, Soundar R. T. Kumara<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The semiconductor industry uses CMP to realize smooth (Ra ~1nm) and flat surfaces for VLSI device fabrication. Complex dynamics underlying the CMP process is a major impediment to effective quality monitoring. It is shown that the signal features, extracted from a novel wireless vibration sensor array, that capture the underlying nonlinear stochastic dynamics provide > 10% improvement in the tracking of CMP material removal rates compared to the use of conventional features.
