Title: Modeling the North American Market for Natural Gas Liquids<br>Author: Robert Brooks, President, RBAC, Inc., 14930 Ventura Blvd, Suite 210, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91364, United States of America, rebrooks@rbac.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: NGL-NA is a multi-commodity model of the North American market for natural gas liquids.  It models NGL supply, processing, fractionation, transportation, and demand for each commodity.  NGL-NA uses optimization techniques to forecast monthly flow volumes and prices of each of the various commodities through existing, planned, and prospective infrastructure.  The presentation will describe the mathematical model, its solution algorithms, preliminary results and further development plans.
