<br>Title: On-line Surface Defect Detection in Rolling Process for Quality Improvement</br><br>Author: Ran Jin, Research Assistant, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, jinr@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jing Li, Jianjun (Jan) Shi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research develops a method for surface defect detection based on the image data obtained from rolling production lines. This method first uses a multiscale Principal Component Analysis to remove the noisy texture of the images and then formulates a searching procedure to locate the defects.</br>
