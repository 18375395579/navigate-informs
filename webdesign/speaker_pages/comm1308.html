Title: Improving Primary Care Access Using Simulation-Optimization<br>Author: Hari Balasubramanian, Post-doctoral Research Associate, Mayo Clinic, 200 2nd Street SW, Rochester, MN, United States, balasubramanian.hari@mayo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ritesh Banerjee, Brian Denton<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of panel design for physicians in primary care. A physician's panel consists of a set of patients and each patient belongs to one of many different health-related categories. Using real data collected at the Mayo Clinic, we propose a multi-period simulation optimization model for determining the panel design of a set of physicians working in a group practice. The model seeks to maximize patient visits to their own providers and reduce waiting times.
