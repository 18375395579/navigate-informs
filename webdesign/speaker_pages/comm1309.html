Sanchez, Ignacio Hoyos<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Electricity markets behavior in a medium-term scope is often represented using a conjectural-variation focusing. In this framework, agents response is represented with fixed parameters that can be obtained from past market analysis. Different approaches can be used to determine these values under these conditions, but when market structure changes, other methods must be used to establish the future value of conjectured variations. Some alternatives will be presented and discussed.
