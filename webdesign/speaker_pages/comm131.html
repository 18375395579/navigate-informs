<br>Title: Critical Factors Affecting the Sustainability of Electrical Equipment Closed-Loop Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Maria Besiou, PhD Candidate, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Vithinias 26, Thessaloniki, 54453, Greece, mmpesiou@auth.gr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Patroklos Georgiadis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we examine the impact of environmental legislation and Design-for-Environment on the behavior of a closed-loop supply chain with recycling activities. We develop a dynamic model using System Dynamics methodology applied to many environmental systems. The developed model is implemented to a real world supply chain of electrical equipment in Greece. Sensitivity analysis reveals statistically significant factors that affect sustainability from an environmental and financial approach.</br>
