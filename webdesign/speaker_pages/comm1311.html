<br>Title: Controlling Greedy Sample Bias through Bias Corrrected Q learning</br><br>Author: Donghun Lee, Princeton University, 35 Olden Street, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, donghunl@princeton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We define non-negative bias caused by greedy sampling in exploitation steps of reinforcement learning using value estimation. We propose additive bias correction framework and apply it to Q learning to construct bias-corrected Q learning. Significant bias reduction and accelerated policy learning are demonstrated in Roulette simulation and intelligent battery control in power grid simulation.</br>
