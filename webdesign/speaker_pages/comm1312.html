Title: Railroad Hazardous Materials Transportation Risk Analysis under Uncertainty<br>Author: Xiang Liu, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, B118 Newark Lab, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, liu94@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Barkan, Rapik Saat<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: There are various sources of input uncertainty in the risk analysis of hazardous materials transportation by rail. In this research, we develop a stochastic model to quantify the effect of parameter uncertainty in the risk analysis. The statistical distribution of risk estimates is developed using probabilistic models and Monte Carlo simulation methods.
