Title: Monotone Properties of Wholesale Price Contracts<br>Author: Vera Tilson, Asssistant Professor, University of Rochester, Simon School of Business, Rochester, NY, United States, Vera.Tilson@case.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We focus on monotonicity properties of wholesale price -- performing qualitative sensitivity analysis using order-theoretical framework.

Many specific cases are encompassed by the assumptions including randomness in both yield and demand
