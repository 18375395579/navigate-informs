<br>Title: Transient Analysis of Serial Production Lines with Bernoulli Machines</br><br>Author: Liang Zhang, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 3200 N. Cramer Street, EMS 307, Milwaukee, WI, 53211, United States of America, liangzh@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chuanfeng Wang, Jorge Arinez, Stephan Biller</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Transient behavior of production systems has significant practical and theoretical implications. However, analytical methods for production systems during transients remain largely unexplored. In the framework of serial lines with Bernoulli machines and finite buffers, we develop a mathematical model and derive formulas to evaluate important transient performance measures. In addition, an efficient procedure based on recursive aggregation is developed to approximate the transient performance.</br>
