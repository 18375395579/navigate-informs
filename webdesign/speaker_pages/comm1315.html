<br>Title: The Design of Experiential Services: Optimal Sequence and Duration of Service Activities</br><br>Author: Aparupa Das Gupta, PhD Candidate, University of California-Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, aparupa@ucla.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Uday Karmarkar, Guillaume Roels</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We address the optimal sequence and duration of activities in a service encounter where customer perceptions of experience are important, as in the hospitality, leisure, and entertainment industries. We employ evidence from behavioral studies about how people evaluate past experiences. We model these phenomena parsimoniously and design service processes to maximize ex-post customer satisfaction.</br>
