Title: Nonstationary System Prediction using Dirichlet Process based Symbolic Transition Analysis<br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Professor, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, United States of America, satish.t.bukkapatnam@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Changqing Cheng, Zhenyu (James) Kong, Zimo Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Multi-step clustering prediction is investigated using Dirichlet process based symbolic dynamic analysis. Symbolic sequence is constructed based on Dirichlet process clustering. Our case studies show that this approach outperforms conventional models for multi-step clustering prediction for non-stationary systems.
