Title: SMART-ISO: A Stochastic, Multiscale Model of the PJM Power Grid<br>Author: Warren Powell, Princeton University, 230 Sherrerd Hall, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, powell@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Boris Defourny, Hugo Simao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We will describe the development of a stochastic, multiscale, dynamic model of the PJM power grid.  SMART-ISO includes a full model of the PJM power grid, a robust day-ahead model for stochastic unit commitment, hour-ahead modeling for planning natural gas simulation, and economic dispatch solved at five minute increments for accurate modeling of ramp rates of natural gas units and variations in renewables.  We report on the status of this multi-year development effort.
