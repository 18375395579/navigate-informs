The CMC is utilized to study large reactors using compartment models to simulate the fluid flow. The CMC ability to track single events was utilized to study the impact of highly turbulent zones on the final particle size distribution. The computational speed of this algorithm allows the solution of problems that may be intractable otherwise.</br>
