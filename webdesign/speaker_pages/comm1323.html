Title: Data Clustering for Fitting Parameters of a Markov Probability Model of Multi-Game Playoff Series<br>Author: Christopher Rump, Assistant Professor, Applied Statistics & Operations Research, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH, 43403, United States of America, cmrump@bgsu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We use data clustering algorithms to group transition probabilities in Markov chain models of a 7-game playoff series. The models provide an extremely good statistical fit to historical playoff outcomes in the NBA and NHL, improving significantly on models based solely on home-away game dependence.
