We use an unsupervised method to automatically extract  hundreds of millions of entity mentions from the web with type  labels. The extracted data is used to train a supervised model for  labeling all entity mentions on the web.  We present regression and  clustering methods that use a ``map-reduce'' environment to address  these web-scale problems.</br>
