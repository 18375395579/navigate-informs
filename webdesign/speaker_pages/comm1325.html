Title: Modeling Nanocrystal Growth with Ex-situ Data<br>Author: Chiwoo Park, Assistant Professor, Florida State University, 2525 Pottsdamer St., Tallahassee, FL, 32311, United States of America, cpark5@fsu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian model for analyzing the  multi-modal growth of nanocrystals with ex-situ TEM image data in absence of in-situ observations. The model provides Bayesian estimation of multiple growth modes of nanocrystals. The estimation result was consistent with real nanocrystal growth trajectories in empirical studies.
