Title: Consequence Minimization Strategy for Water Supply Networks Against Extreme Events<br>Author: David Jeong, Assistant Professor, Oklahoma State University, Engineering South 207, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, david.jeong@okstate.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper presents a mitigation model which can reduce or minimize adverse consequences when a water network suffers from significant water shortage due to the destruction of water networks by malicious attacks or any catastrophic events. A Genetic Algorithm based program linked with a hydraulic solver (EPANET 2.0) is developed to find optimal water supply plans. A case study indicates that the proposed model can successfully generate water supply plans to reduce the consequences
