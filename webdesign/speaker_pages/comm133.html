Assets with real optionality, require dynamic hedging strategies.  The pricing of real options CCRs require  a priori knowledge of the optimal exercise and hedging strategy.  This paper presents the first method for pricing CCRs based on dynamic hedging strategies with multi-factor, multi-commodity futures price models.</br>
