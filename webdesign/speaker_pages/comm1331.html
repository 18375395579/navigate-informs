Title: Pricing Discretely Monitored Lookback Options in Levy Process Models<br>Author: Liming Feng, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, fenglm@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Linetsky<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present an efficient method for pricing discretely monitored lookback option in Levy process models. The method involves a sequential evaluation of Hilbert transforms. A discrete approximation with exponentially decaying errors is developed based on the Whittaker cardinal series for functions analytic in a strip in the complex plane.
