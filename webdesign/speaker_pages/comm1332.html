Title: Optimization of Agricultural Biomass Supply Chain for Cellulosic Ethanol Production<br>Author: Taraneh Sowlati, University of  British Columbia, Department of Wood Science, Faculty of Forestry, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada, Taraneh.Sowlati@ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mahmood Ebadian, Shahab Sokhansanj<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper, a combined simulation/optimization model is developed to model and analyse Satellite Storages (SSs) in an agricultural biomass supply chain for cellulosic ethanol production. The time dependence and stochastic nature of the supply chain are taken into account using the simulation model. The optimization model addresses the optimum number and location of SSs. Three storage scenarios are identified and their efficiency are compared.
