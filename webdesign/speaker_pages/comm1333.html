Title: Portfolio Selection with Robust Estimates of Risk<br>Author: Victor DeMiguel, Assistant Professor of Decision Sciences, London Business School, London, United Kingdom, avmiguel@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francisco Nogales<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Markowitz portfolios perform poorly out-of-sample due to estimation error. A robust estimator provides meaningful information even when the sample distribution deviates from normality or has outliers. We show how to compute portfolios that minimize a robust estimate of risk. We give a bound on the sensitivity of these portfolios to changes on asset return distribution. Numerical results show the robust portfolios outperform classical portfolios on simulated and empirical data.
