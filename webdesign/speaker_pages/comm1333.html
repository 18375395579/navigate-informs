A robust estimator provides meaningful information even when the sample distribution deviates from normality or has outliers. We show how to compute portfolios that minimize a robust estimate of risk. We give a bound on the sensitivity of these portfolios to changes on asset return distribution. Numerical results show the robust portfolios outperform classical portfolios on simulated and empirical data.</br>
