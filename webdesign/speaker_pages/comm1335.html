Title: A Hybrid Bertrand-Cournot Model of Electricity Markets with Multiple Subnetworks<br>Author: Jian Yao, University of California, Department of IEOR, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, jyao@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren, Benjamin Hobbs<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a hybrid Bertrand-Cournot model of electricity markets where inter-subnetwork connections are frequently congested but intra-subnetwork connections are not. In this model, generators behave Cournot regarding inter-subnetwork transmission quantities, but Bertrand regarding intra-subnetwork transmission prices. Numerical examples suggest that this model leads to equilibrium prices higher than those from a homogeneous Bertrand model, but lower than those from a homogenous Cournot model.
