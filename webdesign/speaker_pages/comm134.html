Title: Public Policy Decision-making Subject to Uncertain Implementation<br>Author: Paul Kerl, Georgia Institute of Technology, 500 Tech Parkway, ATLANTA, GA, 30318, United States of America, paul.kerl@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joel Sokol<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Public policy decisions are sometimes made as though an implementation is exact, with no unexpected deviations. We examine a stylized model of public policy decisions under uncertainty.  We model altered decisions through a framework of uncertain optimization algorithms.  We provide proofs of convergence and alternative step size and direction choices when using an uncertain method. Results are shown for a suite of problems, illustrating the importance of alternative decisions under uncertainty.
