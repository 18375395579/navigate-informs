This study presents decision support models based on the environmental consequences of these taxiways at one airport. Two types of decision rules are evaluated (a) static rules, based on always or never using the EAT or based on arrival time; and (b) dynamic rules that use random forests to assign taxiways on a per aircraft basis.</br>
