<br>Title: An Approach to Developing Growth and Yield Models for Multi-species Forest Stands</br><br>Author: Jules Comeau, Dalhousie University, 37 Braemar Dr., Moncton, NB, E1A3S7, Canada, jcomeau5@dal.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eldon Gunn</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Generally speaking, stand level models include variables such as average stand diameter, stand basal area and stand dominant height.  Although stand level models are simple and robust, historically the number of species and the number of size distributions in multi-species stands have made them difficult to model using a few stand-level variables.  This paper discusses a methodology for growing multi-species stands and shows results of the methodology applied to the Nova Scotia Acadian Forest.</br>
