Title: Integrating Mathematical Optimization in DEVS for Nuclear Medicine Patient and Resource Scheduling<br>Author: Eduardo Perez, Assistant Professor, Texas State University, Roy F.

Procedures in nuclear medicine are multistep, and have to be performed under strict time windows constraints. In this work, we develop and implement a DEVS model of a nuclear medicine clinic that uses CPLEX to optimize patient and resource schedules. We report on computational results based on a real clinic, historical data, and both patient and management performance measures.
