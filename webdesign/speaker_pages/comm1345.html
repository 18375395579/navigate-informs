Title: Using Cyberinfrastructure Tools to Solve Bicriteria Integer Programs<br>Author: Ted Ralphs, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, United States, tkr2@lehigh.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We discuss solution of several classes of difficult bicriteria integer programming problems on the computational grid using a parallel algorithm based on the weighted Chebyshev norm scalarization. The talk will focus on the cyberinfrastructure tools used, the challenges faced in parallelizing the algorithm, and the use of advanced methodology to improve soluton times.
