When only partial distributional information is available, however, these models exhibit significant model risk. In this talk we discuss a Worst-Case VaR (WVaR) that is designed to mitigate model risk. We extend WVaR to portfolios that exhibit a polyhedral or quadratic dependence on the risk factors and show how it can be used to structure derivative portfolios.</br>
