Title: Worst-Case Value-at-Risk of Non-Linear Portfolios<br>Author: Daniel Kuhn, Imperial College London, 180 Queen's Gate, London, United Kingdom, d.kuhn@imperial.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Steve Zymler, Berc Rustem<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Most portfolio optimization models involving Value-at-Risk (VaR) assume that the distribution of the risk factors is known exactly. When only partial distributional information is available, however, these models exhibit significant model risk. In this talk we discuss a Worst-Case VaR (WVaR) that is designed to mitigate model risk. We extend WVaR to portfolios that exhibit a polyhedral or quadratic dependence on the risk factors and show how it can be used to structure derivative portfolios.
