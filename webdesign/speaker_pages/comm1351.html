Title: Models of Facility Reliability<br>Author: Michael Lim, PhD Student, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60201, United States, m-lim2@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Daskin, Sunnil Chopra<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We extend the fixed charge facility location model to account for reliable and unreliable facilities. We derive structural results from the analytic variant of the model and show how the discrete model may be effectively solved using Lagrangian relaxation. Computational results are provided for moderate sized datasets.
