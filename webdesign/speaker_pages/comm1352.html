Title: Simulation Modeling for Mass Vaccination Clinic Design<br>Author: John Osborn, Analyst, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Centerplace 8, Rochester, MN, 55905, United States of America, Osborn.John@mayo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Bailey<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the event of community exposure to an infectious agent, such as during a pandemic or bioterrorist event, rapid prophylaxis of a large population will be essential in effective response.  Using simulation models, we evaluated a set of mass vaccination clinic designs to determine optimal staffing and resource allocation to achieve maximal patient throughput.  This paper will review pertinent findings, compare model outputs to actual experience, and discuss planning limitations and challenges.
