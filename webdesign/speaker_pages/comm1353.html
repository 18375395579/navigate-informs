Title: A Microscopic Simulation Approach for Network-Based Airlines Competition Analysis<br>Author: Ahmed Abdelghany, Assistant Professor, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, 600 S. Clyde Morris Boulevard, Daytona Beach, FL, United States, abdel776@erau.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Khaled Abdelghany, Gregory Coldren<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A network-based modeling framework for airlines competition analysis is presented. The framework adopts a microscopic simulation approach in which passengers are represented at the individual level. The model estimates the airlines market share and flights load factor as function of their supply-related decisions including flight schedule, seat inventory control, and ticket distribution. Simulation experiments that illustrate the model functionalities are presented.
