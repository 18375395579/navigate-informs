Title: A Roadmap for Formulating a Generation Expansion Planning Model to Minimize Healthcare Costs<br>Author: Mark Rodgers, PhD Student/Graduate Fellow, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, CoRE Building, Room 201, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, mdrodgers07@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Frank Felder, Saltuk Selcuklu, David Coit<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The framework for formulating a long-term power generation expansion planning model to minimize healthcare costs is described. We extend the typical least-cost GEP algorithm to consider societal healthcare costs incurred due to unfavorable implications resulting from power plant emissions. Methods of quantifying these costs will be evaluated, and a mathematical framework for this particular GEP model will be presented. Various surrogate based optimization techniques will also be assessed.
