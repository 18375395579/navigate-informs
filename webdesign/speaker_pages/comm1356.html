We extend the typical least-cost GEP algorithm to consider societal healthcare costs incurred due to unfavorable implications resulting from power plant emissions. Methods of quantifying these costs will be evaluated, and a mathematical framework for this particular GEP model will be presented. Various surrogate based optimization techniques will also be assessed.</br>
