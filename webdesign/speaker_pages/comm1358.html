The data come from a telecommunication firm’s targeted marketing campaign, which form a natural testbed for studying network-based marketing because both direct consumer interactions and product adoption are observable. We show that models built using attributes constructed from the consumer interaction network enable better prediction of product adoption than traditional targeted marketing techniques.</br>
