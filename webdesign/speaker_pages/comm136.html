Brigade Aviation Maintenance Officers (BAMOs) on the other hand, predict parts needs for upcoming mission characteristics based on failures observed in the past under similar mission conditions. Semantic analysis offers the possibility of machine reasoning to combine knowledge of MBF with CBM ?supporting BAMO-like machine reasoning in combination with CBM capabilities.</br>
