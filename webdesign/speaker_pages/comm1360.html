Title: Testing and Validating Agent Models for Networks<br>Author: David Banks, Professor, Duke University, ISDS Box 90251, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, banks@stat.duke.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Dynamic network models are important for genetics, social science, disease tracking, and counterterrorism. The traditional school in this area has emphasized formal mathematical models, but many researchers find agent-based models to be more useful. The main problem for both approaches is goodness-of-fit testing. This talk discusses the goodness-of-fit issue and describes solution strategies.
