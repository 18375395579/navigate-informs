Several Federal authorities state that there are weaknesses in the models currently used in practice. We present a robust optimization model for identifying relief shelter locations and the levels of emergency supplies to position at the shelters prior to a hurricane threat to a targeted area. We apply the model to three different evacuation scenarios and show its promise.
