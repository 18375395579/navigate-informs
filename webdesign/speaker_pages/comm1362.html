<br>Title: Incorporating Social Influence in Customer Management Decisions</br><br>Author: Ishwar Murthy, Professor, Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, IIM Bangalore, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore, 560076, India, ishwar@IIMB.ERNET.IN</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sumit Sarkar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Customer interactions on social media can influence adoption, retention and usage of products and services. Current methods of computing customer lifetime value do not recognize peer influence. Hence, decision support models that maximize lifetime value may yield sub-optimal solutions. We propose a MDP based decision support model that incorporates lagged social influence while arriving at optimal policy for existing customer management.</br>
