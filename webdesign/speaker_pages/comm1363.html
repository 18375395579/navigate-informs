Mech., Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, chiu@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jorge Villalobos, Pitu Mirchandani</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: MALTA is a temporally and spatially scalable dynamic vehicular traffic  simulation and assignment model that is based on network partitioning  concepts and techniques for both mesoscopic traffic simulation and  time-dependent shortest path algorithms. In this talk we present the overall model structure and the numerical experiment results on a test urban traffic network.</br>
