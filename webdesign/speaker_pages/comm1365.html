Title: A New Statistical Learning Method for Mouse Brain Segmentation<br>Author: Min Zhang, Arizona State University, 699 S Mill Ave, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, mzhang33@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Teresa Wu, Alexandra Badea, Rong Pan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce a new statistical learning method, integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Markov Random Field (MRF) approaches, to segment different transgenic mouse brain models Magnetic Resonance Microscopy (MRM) images. By using our model, more accurate, computational efficient and robust result can be achieved.
