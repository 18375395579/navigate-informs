<br>Title: Fast Graph Structure Learning from Unlabeled Data for Event Detection</br><br>Author: Sriram Somanchi, PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University, 4800 Forbes Avenue, Heinz College, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, somanchi@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Neill</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Processes such as disease propagation often spread over some latent network structure which must be learned from observation. We propose a new framework for learning graph structure from unlabeled data by comparing the most anomalous subsets detected with and without the graph constraints. Using simulated disease outbreaks injected into real-world hospital data, we show that our method learns a structure similar to the true underlying graph, but enables faster and more accurate detection.</br>
