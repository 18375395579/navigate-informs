<br>Title: Capability Enhanced Adaptive Sensor Allocation Strategy for Process Monitoring and Diagnosis in a BN</br><br>Author: Kaibo Liu, Research Assistant, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 765 Ferst Drive, Room 109, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, kbliu@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jianjun (Jan) Shi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Multivariate process control in Distributed Sensor Networks (DSN) is a challenging issue. This research study proposes a method to adaptively reallocate sensor resources based on online observations in a Bayesian network, which can enhance monitoring and diagnosis capabilities. Case studies are performed on a hot forming process and a cap alignment process to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under different objectives.</br>
