<br>Title: Prediction of the Failure Interval with Maximum Power based on Remaining Useful Life Distribution</br><br>Author: Junbo Son, University of Wisconson, Madison, WI, United States of America, json5@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mutasim Salman, Shiyu Zhou, Qiang Zhou</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Prognosis of remaining useful life (RUL) of a unit or a system plays an important role in system reliability. One key aspect of the RUL prognosis is constructing the best prediction interval. In this paper, we propose a new method, namely maximum prediction power interval (MPI). The MPI guarantees the best prediction performance under the given acceptable error range. A numerical simulation study and case study with real data confirm the better features of MPI over existing prediction intervals.</br>
