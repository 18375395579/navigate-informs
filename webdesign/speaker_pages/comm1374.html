Title: Improving Laboratory Networks for Early Infant HIV Diagnosis in Sub-Saharan Africa<br>Author: Jeremie Gallien, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW14SA, United Kingdom, jgallien@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sarang Deo, Jonas Oddur Jonasson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many sub-Saharan countries experience high mortality rates among HIV+ infants. An important cause is the long delay to obtain diagnosis due to ineffective systems for transporting and analyzing blood samples and communicating results. Using a representative dataset combining information from several countries, we develop a queueing network model to estimate the potential public health impact of operational interventions such as clinic assignment optimization and segmentation of samples.
