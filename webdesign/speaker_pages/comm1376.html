Title: Conditional Value-at-risk for Hazardous Materials Transportation on Time-dependent Networks<br>Author: Changhyun Kwon, Assistant Profesor, University at Buffalo, SUNY, 400 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, chkwon@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Iakovos Toumazis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose new methods for mitigating risk in hazardous materials (hazmat) transportation, based on conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure, on time-dependent vehicular networks. While the CVaR risk measure has been popularly used in financial portfolio optimization problems, its application in hazmat transportation has been very recently proposed. The CVaR models are shown to be flexible and general routing models for hazmat transportation, and be solved efficiently.
