Title: Quantifying Marginal Values of Historical and Real-time Traffic Information<br>Author: Tao Xing, University of Utah, Civil Engineering Department, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, tao.xing@utah.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuesong Zhou<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A challenging question in traveler information services is how to quantify the value of information from different data sources such as fixed detectors, AVI readers and mobile GPS probes. Focusing on transportation sensor network design problems, this talk presents an information-theoretic model to systematically capture the marginal values of historical data and real-time traffic measurements in different applications such as travel time estimation and incident detection.
