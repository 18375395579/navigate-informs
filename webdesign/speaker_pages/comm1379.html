Title: Optimization of personalized prostate cancer screening based on PSA dynamics<br>Author: Daniel Underwood, North Carolina State University, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, United States of America, daniel.underwood@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton, James Wilson, Jingyu Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a simulation optimization model for optimal design of personalized prostate cancer screening policies that account for multiple cancer grades, demographic- and comorbidity-based risk factors, family history, and changes in PSA over time. We describe methods for solving the model based on the combined use of a genetic algorithm, COMPASS, and OCBA. Numerical results are presented to show the relative benefits of incorporating personalized risk factors as compared to current guidelines.
