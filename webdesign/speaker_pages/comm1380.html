Title: Modeling to Inform Proactive Management of Inpatient Care<br>Author: Muge Capan, North Carolina State University, 400 Daniels Hall; College of Engineering, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, mcapan@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Julie S. Ivy<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Improving inpatient care is an emerging focus in hospitalist systems. By considering patients?frailty and vital signs, patient profiling provides a method for predicting deterioration in patient health. We propose to develop an optimization model based on sequential health data to create proactive health measures and support individualized rescue interventions.
