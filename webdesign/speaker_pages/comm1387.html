Title: Double-Sided Batch Queues with Abandonment: Modeling Crossing Networks<br>Author: Adam Diamant, PhD Candidate, University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, Adam.Diamant09@Rotman.Utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Milner, Philipp Afeche<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Crossing networks are increasingly important in the operation of modern financial markets. We model these as double-sided batch arrival queues with abandonment. We derive closed-form expressions for the fill rate and system time and present a sensitivity analysis that compares our model with simulation results. We investigate how the performance measures are affected by customers with different order size distributions, counterparty preferences and a mix of patient/impatient customer types.
