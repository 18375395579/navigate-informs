<br>Title: Time Series Analysis of Laboratory Test Results to Prevent Adverse Patient Outcomes</br><br>Author: Alcides Santander-Mercado, Doctoral Student, UniNorte - University of South Florida, 3620 Jefferson Commons Drive, Apt. 302, Tampa, Fl, 33613, United States of America, asantand@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Fabri, Jose Zayas-Castro</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Currently, patients?diagnostics are usually based on a single data point from the most recent test, ignoring the patient's historical record. No other methods are currently utilized to assist physicians in capturing the dynamic nature of physiologic systems and hidden interactions between test indicators. Timely identification of possible adverse outcomes in patients' health can be improved, by developing integrated patients' profiles and the analysis of laboratory tests over time.</br>
