Title: Protecting Forest Health:  A Spatial SIR Model for Controlling Destructive Forest Insects<br>Author: Robert Haight, USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, 1992 Folwell Ave, St. Paul, MN, 55108, United States of America, rhaight@fs.fed.us<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We model the spatial-dynamics of emerald ash borer (EAB) in Minneapolis-Saint Paul using a susceptible-infectious-resistant (SIR) framework for neighborhood ash trees. The model accounts for susceptible and infected trees over time and space based on growth and dispersal of EAB adults and phloem consumption by larvae.  We use the SIR model to determine the location and timing of ash treatments and removals to maximize public benefits subject to the city’s EAB control budget.
