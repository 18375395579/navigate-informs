Title: A Real-Time Freeway Travel Time Prediction Approach for Normal and Bottlenecked Traffic Conditions<br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, PO Box 210072, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, chiu@utep.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hongsheng Xu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This presentation discusses the methodology for predicting freeway point-to-point travel time under both normal and bottlenecked traffic conditions. The research focuses on the real-time operations of multiple input-output curves at different locations of the freeway segment of interest. This allows the travel time under both the normal and bottlenecked traffic conditions to be reasonably predicted. Empirical testing results are also presented and discussed.
