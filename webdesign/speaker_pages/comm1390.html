Title: E-Quality for Manufacturing (EQM) Integrated with Web-Enabled Production System<br>Author: Yongjin Kwon, Assistant Professor, Applied Engineering Technology, Drexel University, 3001 Market Street, Suite 100, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, yk73@drexel.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mira Lalovic-Hand<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of integrating internet-based remote quality control using a web based vision system and an assembly robot. The web-based quality control presents an opportunity for many key improvements such as ubiquitous access, monitoring capability, and integration of production equipment into information networks for improved efficiency and product quality within the framework of Concurrent Engineering and Design for Manufacturing.
