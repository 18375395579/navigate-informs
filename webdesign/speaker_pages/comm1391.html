Mathematical models have played a key role in analyzing infectious disease epidemics. Unfortunately, few of these models extend to resource-limited settings, where not all patients can be treated. In this paper we propose a mathematical framework for optimizing the allocation of scarce treatment in a heterogeneous population. We use approximate dynamic programming to ?nd near-optimal solutions and derive structural properties of the proposed policies. We illustrate our approach on HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa, where millions are infected and treatment is scarce. We use clinically validated HIV progression and transmission models to calibrate our model as well as to evaluate the performance of policies. The resulting policies are compared against those derived from the recommendations of the World Health Organization. Our results indicate that the proposed policies consistently outperform recommendations from international organizations by 19%. Moreover, they shed light on the key role allocation policies play in containing the epidemic.</br>
