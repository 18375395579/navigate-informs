<br>Title: Active Learning via Sequential Design with Applications to Anti-money Laundering</br><br>Author: Xinwei Deng, Ph.D Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, xdeng@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roshan Vengazhiyil, Agus Sudjianto, C. F. Jeff Wu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Anti-money laundering is an important responsibility. There are millions of transactions happening each day. Investigating each transaction and classifying an account to be suspicious or not is time-consuming. In this article, we propose an active learning method using Bayesian sequential designs to detect money-laundering. The sequential nature helps to identify suspicious accounts with minimal effort. An application to real banking data is used to demonstrate the performance of the method.</br>
