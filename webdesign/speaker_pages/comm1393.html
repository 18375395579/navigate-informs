The asymmetric environment makes detecting and defeating this threat complex and challenging.  This presentation explores the feasibility of using agent based models to provide insights into countering this threat in urban environments and stability and support operations. It addresses potential methodologies to establish measures of effectiveness to assess the effectiveness of the tactics used.</br>
