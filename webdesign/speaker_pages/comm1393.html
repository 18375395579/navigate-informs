Title: Using Agent Based Models to Assess Strategies Against Asymmetric Warfare<br>Author: Niki Goerger, ERDC Research Associate at USMA, Engineer Research and Development Center, Department of Systems Engineering, United States Military Academy, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, Niki.Goerger@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Simon Goerger, Gregory Griffin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Asymmetric Warfare threats are often devastating in effect, hard to detect, and difficult to thwart.  The asymmetric environment makes detecting and defeating this threat complex and challenging.  This presentation explores the feasibility of using agent based models to provide insights into countering this threat in urban environments and stability and support operations. It addresses potential methodologies to establish measures of effectiveness to assess the effectiveness of the tactics used.
