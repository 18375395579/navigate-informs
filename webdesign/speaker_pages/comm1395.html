Existing methods allow to predict an expected value for the response, but do not account for its intrinsic variability. Variability is instead crucial whenever we intend to take actions based on the predictions. I will present a new, theoretically well-motivated approach to this problem, and illustrate it on applications in the domain of social network analysis.</br>
