Title: Reasoning about Uncertainty in High-Dimensional Statistics, and Social Network Analysis<br>Author: Adel Javanmard, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, Room 239, 350 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, adelj@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrea Montanari<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A common task in modern data analysis is to predict a response variable based on a large number of potentially relevant attributes. Existing methods allow to predict an expected value for the response, but do not account for its intrinsic variability. Variability is instead crucial whenever we intend to take actions based on the predictions. I will present a new, theoretically well-motivated approach to this problem, and illustrate it on applications in the domain of social network analysis.
