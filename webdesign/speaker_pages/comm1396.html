Title: A Method for Computing Optimal Set-point Schedules for HVAC Systems<br>Author: Jingyang Xu, The Walt Disney Company, 1375 Buena Vista Dr., Orlando, United States of America, jxu7@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Nikovski, Mio Nonaka<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a method for model-based control of building air conditioning systems that minimizes energy costs while maintaining occupant comfort. The method uses a building thermal model in the form of a thermal circuit identified from collected sensor data, and reduces the building thermal dynamics to a Markov decision process (MDP) whose decision variables are the sequence of temperature set-points over a suitable horizon.
