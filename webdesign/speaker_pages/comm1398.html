Title: Using Remote Sensors to Support Health-monitoring and Management of Transportation Infrastructure<br>Author: Pablo Durango-Cohen, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, A332, Evanston, IL, 60202, United States of America, pdc@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yikai Chen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Motivated by recent technological advances, we describe the development and validation of a statistical process control framework to support health-monitoring and management of transportation infrastructure.  The framework consists of formulation of statistical models to explain/predict common-cause variation, and use of multivariate control charts to detect special-cause variation.   We present numerous examples to validate the framework.
