Title: Exact Simulation for Option Pricing and Greek Estimation<br>Author: Nan Chen, Chinese University of Hong Kong, 709A,  William Mong Engineering Building, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong - ROC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate how to use exact simulation technique to estimate prices and Greeks of derivative securities. The idea is to consider the probability density of diffusions under Wiener measure, instead of Lebesgue measure. The availability of closed form under Wiener measure facilitates us conducting simulation to draw exact samples and meanwhile obtaining unbiased estimators with small variances for Greeks.
