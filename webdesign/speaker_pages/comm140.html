Behavioral economics has long struggled with the challenge of how individuals construct their beliefs even though they lack the cognitive capacity to process all the information available to them.  Two major threads of the bounded rationality literature have emerged.  In one thread, including Herbert Simon's satisficing model, people use simple decision rules to decide how to act.  These models strip away the classic economic framework of constrained optimization, instead assuming people rely on intuition in various ways.  In a second thread, people optimally decide how to allocate their scarce attention, focusing their energy on high-impact information and spending more time on problems with a high return-to-cognition.  These models typically assume that the cognitive allocation task is done intuitively.  This paper contrasts these two approaches in the context of a judgment task by law enforcement officials.</br>
