Title: Intuitive Demand Forecasting: Cognitive Simulation and Naive Statistics<br>Author: Jordan Tong, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 975 University Ave, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, jtong@bus.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Feiler<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present an analytical model capturing the psychological underpinnings of single-period demand forecasting. The model assumes individuals cognitively simulate a small sample of possible outcomes and then naively treat it as representative of the true demand distribution. We derive several biases from the model, which we validate experimentally. Finally, we apply the model to study aggregation techniques, using forecast dispersion to predict group confidence, and behavioral newsvendor costs.
