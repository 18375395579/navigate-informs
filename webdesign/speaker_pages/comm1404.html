Title: Models for the Analysis and Optimization of Workforce Dynamics<br>Author: Mayank Sharma, Research Director, IBM TJ Watson Research Center, 1099 Kitchawan Rd, Ossining, NY, 10562, United States of America, mxsharma@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Yingdong Lu, Mark Squillante, Bo Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A fundamental workforce analytics capability concerns the modeling, analysis and optimization of decisions to control workforce dynamics; all of which are quite different from the corresponding problems in traditional supply chains. To address these challenges, we develop models for the evolutionary dynamics of human talent and skill composition, and solve the corresponding stochastic optimization (control) problem based on these models to maximize expected business performance over time.
