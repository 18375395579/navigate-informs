Proponents of Taxes have argued that Cap-and-Trade could facilitate collusion among firms via the trading mechanism, leading to suboptimal welfare outcomes. We examine this claim using a rigorous yet rich model of production and pollution under competition that allows for the possibility of collusion among firms via trading.</br>
