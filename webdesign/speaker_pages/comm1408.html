Title: Using Probabilistic Terrorism Risk Modeling For Regulatory Benefit-Cost Analysis<br>Author: Henry Willis, Policy Researcher, RAND Corporation, 4570 Fifth Avenue, Suite 600, Pittsburgh, PA, 15217, United States, hwillis@rand.org<br>Coauthor(s): Tom LaTourrette<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The White House Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to use benefit-cost analyses to evaluate proposed regulations. However, data and methods for estimating the benefits of terrorism security regulations cannot at present support such analysis. This paper demonstrates a framework for using probabilistic terrorism modeling in a break-even analysis of a regulatory action and discusses how this type of analysis can be further integrated into the regulatory review process.
