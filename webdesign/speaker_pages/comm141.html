We do so by applying text mining techniques on buyer-generated feedback posted on reputation systems, by scoring these dimensions based sentiment analysis, and using them to estimate econometric models associating reputation with price premiums. This talk will discuss how to integrate econometric, text mining and predictive modeling techniques towards the analysis of user-generated content.</br>
