Title: Assessing Solution Quality in Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Amit Partani, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Texas, Graduate Program in Operations Research, 1 University Station C2200, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, partani@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Morton<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We discuss an adaptive jackknife estimator to reduce bias. It does not require a priori knowledge regarding the order of bias. We discuss convergence properties and apply it in the context of Monte Carlo-based simulation procedures in stochastic programming. We provide a bias reduction strategy for the optimality gap estimator of a candidate decision based on the adaptive estimator. Computational results are presented to evaluate the performance of the adaptive estimator.
