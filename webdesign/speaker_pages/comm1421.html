Title: Myocardial Infarction Identification Using Recurrence Quantification Analysis of Vectorcardiogram<br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Oklahoma State University, EN 322, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, satish.t.bukkapatnam@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hui Yang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals monitor the spatiotemporal cardiac electrical activity along three orthogonal planes. This paper presents the recurrence quantification analysis of VCG signals for detecting the myocardial infarction. Myocardial Infarction classification accuracies based on the recurrence features were found to be as high as 97% for neural network and linear regression classification model.
