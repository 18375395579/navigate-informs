<br>Title: Some Perspectives on Facing Elicitation Difficulties in Multi-Attribute Decision Analysis</br><br>Author: Luis Dias, Assistant Professor, INESCC / FEUC, Rua Antero Quental 199, Coimbra, C, 3000-033, Portugal, lmcdias@fe.uc.pt</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This presentation brings a methodological discussion on facing elicitation difficulties regarding preference-related parameters. Robustness analysis is contrasted with sensitivity analysis, and its role is discussed. A compromise is proposed regarding the ideas of heroic approximation, requisite modeling, and rigorous modeling. The proposed methodology consists of using robustness analysis throughout the whole decision process as a tool to guide that process, using DSS such as VIP or IRIS.</br>
