<br>Title: Optimal Choice for Appointment Scheduling Window under Patient No-show Behavior</br><br>Author: Nan Liu, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America, nl2320@columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Observing that patients with longer appointment delays tend to have higher no-show rates, many providers put a limit on how far into the future that an appointment can be scheduled. We study how such choices of appointment windows affect a provider’s operational efficiency. We consider two models. The first one assumes patients are homogeneous. The second model faces two types of patients differing in no-show and arrival rates, and the provider can use patient type-specific appointment windows.</br>
