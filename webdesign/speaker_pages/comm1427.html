Title: An Efficient Method for Fatigue and Fracture Analysis with Uncertainity Quantification<br>Author: Qingyu William Yang, Assistant Professor, Wayne State University, 4815 Fourth Street, Rm 2167, Detroit, MI, 48335, United States of America, qyang@wayne.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nailong Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Fatigue damage is defined as material fails due to repeated application of loads that are not large enough to cause failure in one single application. We developed an efficient statistical model to capture the model uncertainty for fatigue and fracture analysis. A case study is conducted to verify the proposed method.
