<br>Title: The Decision Model for the Optimal Time Points to Repair Aging Multistate Systems</br><br>Author: Yung-Wen Liu, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan-Dearborn, 4901 Evergreen Road, Dearborn, MI, 48128, United States of America, ywliu@umich.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Customers may consider repairing the system when they are dissatisfied with how it works even before it reaches the failure. However, repairing costs and other factors may make customers hesitate to repair it. The nonstationary stochastic processes are used to model the deterioration and repairing processes for aging multistate systems, and customers' disutility functions, costs and other factors are used to build the optimization model for customers to decide when a system should be repaired.</br>
