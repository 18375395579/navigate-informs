Title: Introduction to Condor: Resources for High-throughput Computing<br>Author: Matthew Saltzman, Clemson University, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Clemson, SC, United States of America, mjs@clemson.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: High-throughput computing (HTC) means running large numbers of relatively independent tasks.  HTC is an appropriate pardigm for many different computational tasks, such as simulations, metaheuristics, and computational testing.  The Condor system--developed at the University of Wisconsin--is designed to reclaim idle computing resources and manage them in support of HTC tasks.    We describe the Condor system and its operation and use in HTC applications.
