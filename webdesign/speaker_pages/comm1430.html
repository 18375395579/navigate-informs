Title: Modeling Power Systems with a High Penetration of Renewables<br>Author: Sonja Wogrin, IIT, Comillas Pontifical University, Madrid, Spain, sonja.wogrin@iit.upcomillas.es<br>Coauthor(s): Andrés Delgadillo, Javier Reneses, Pablo Dueñas<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a new modeling approach to address the challenges that arise in power systems with a high penetration of renewable energy sources by introducing system states instead of traditional load periods. This allows us to represent important operational details such as start-up and shut- down decisions in medium- or long-term models thereby overcoming the lack of chronological information predominant in current models.
