Title: Simultaneous Optimization of P/L and Payoff Functions for Wind Derivatives Using Prediction Errors<br>Author: Yuji Yamada, University of Tsukuba, Tokyo, Japan, yuji@gssm.otsuka.tsukuba.ac.jp<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a new type of weather derivatives based on the prediction error of wind speed, and estimate its hedge effect on the wind power energy businesses. First, we investigate the correlation between power output and wind speed prediction errors at a wind farm. Then we will develop a methodology that optimally constructs a wind derivative based on the prediction errors. Finally, a simultaneous optimization technique of the P/L and payoff functions for wind derivatives is demonstrated.
