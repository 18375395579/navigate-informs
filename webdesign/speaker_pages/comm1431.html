First, we investigate the correlation between power output and wind speed prediction errors at a wind farm. Then we will develop a methodology that optimally constructs a wind derivative based on the prediction errors. Finally, a simultaneous optimization technique of the P/L and payoff functions for wind derivatives is demonstrated.</br>
