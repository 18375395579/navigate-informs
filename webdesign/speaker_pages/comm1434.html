Title: Object-algebraic Modeling Using POAMS: The Platform for Object-algebraic Modeling Systems<br>Author: Leonardo B. Lopes, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, Systems & Industrial Eng.

As expected, the object-algebraic approach makes the development of new models easier and less error-prone. In optimization modeling we get an extra benefit: the object-algebraic description of a model often highlights important relationships that lead to decomposition approaches.
