Title: Gap Analysis for Metabolic Models<br>Author: Paul Brooks, Assistant Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, PO Box 843083, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States of America, JPBrooks@vcu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is the use of a linear program to model the flow of metabolites through reactions in a cell.  Simulations using FBA models can generate hypotheses testable in a lab environment.  A common problem when studying bacteria is the development of a defined culture medium that will sustain the organism.  We develop a mixed-integer program that aids in the construction of FBA models and indicates possible components of a sustaining culture medium.
