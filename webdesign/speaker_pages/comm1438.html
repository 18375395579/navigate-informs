Title: Approximations for Markov Perfect Industry Dynamics<br>Author: Gabriel Weintraub, Columbia Business School, gweintraub@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): C Lanier Benkard, Benjamin Van Roy<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Dynamic models of imperfect competition are used in applied economics to analyze diverse dynamic phenomena. A major shortcoming, however, is the computational complexity involved in solving for the equilibrium, which has severely limited their applicability. We introduce approximation methods based on new equilibrium concepts that dramatically reduce the computational complexity. Our methods greatly increase the set of dynamic models of imperfect competition that can be analyzed computationally.
