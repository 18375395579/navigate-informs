Title: Optimization via Simulation with Industrial Strength COMPASS<br>Author: Barry L Nelson, Professor, Northwestern University, Department of Ind. Eng. & Mgmt. Sci., 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, nelsonb@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Hong, Jie Xu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Industrial Strength COMPASS (ISC) is a particular implementation of a general framework for optimizing the expected value of a performance measure of a stochastic simulation with respect to integer-ordered decision variables. ISC provides convergence guarantees and statistical  inference when it terminates while addressing problems of practical size and complexity. We describe the framework behind ISC and compare it to a popular commercial solver.
