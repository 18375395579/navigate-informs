Title: Instantaneous Communication Throughputs of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks<br>Author: Hao Yang, University of California, Irvine, 24 Ovation Ln, Aliso Viejo, CA, United States of America, hyang5@uci.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wen-Long Jin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, models for two types of instantaneous throughputs of VANETs, broadcast and unicast, are analytically derived with a protocol communication model along discrete and continuous traffic streams.  They are validated with Monte Carlo simulations. We find that throughputs are unimodal functions in both percentage of senders and transmission range and can be significantly impacted by vehicular traffic patterns and other factors.
