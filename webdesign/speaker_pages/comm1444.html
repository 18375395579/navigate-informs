<br>Title: Network Models and Biproportional Apportionment for Fair Seat Allocation in the UK Elections</br><br>Author: Kerem Akartunali, Strathclyde Business School, Dept. of Management Science, 40 George Street, Glasgow, G1 1QE, United Kingdom, kerem.akartunali@strath.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Philip Knight</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Allocating seats in an election is a socially interesting problem that can be modelled using networks, for which we propose a wide choice of objective functions and allocation schemes. Then, we discuss biproportional apportionment and its application to single seat constituencies. In particular, we propose methods that can be tuned to meet public's definition of fairness. Using data from the 2010 UK elections, we study a variety of models, and address conditions of existence and uniqueness.</br>
