Title: Multi-curve Modeling with Multi-factor Short Rate Models<br>Author: Qi Wu, Assistant Professor, Chinese University of Hong Kong, 507, William M.W. Mong Eng. Building, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong - PRC, qwu@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The burst of US housing bubble and the on-going European sovereign debt crisis have fundamentally changed the way global fixed income markets operate, so has been the modeling of interest rates. In this talk, we discuss the joint curve modeling in short rate framework with multi-factor Gaussian processes and provide accurate analytical approximations of swaption normal vol and caplet vol.
