We develop math programming models for this purpose to maximize social welfare. First, we construct a measure of neighborhood-level viability, calibrated with real-world data for the city of New Orleans. Second, we construct and evaluate a neighborhood development model to maximize the total viability of neighborhoods by optimally assigning land uses subject to budget, contiguity and spatial orientation constraints.</br>
