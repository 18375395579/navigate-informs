Title: Mathematical Models for Reconstruction Planning in Urban Areas<br>Author: Changmi Jung, Doctoral Student, Heinz School of Public Policy & Management, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, United States, changmi@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Johnson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: After a natural disaster, urban planners must design a restoration strategy. We develop math programming models for this purpose to maximize social welfare. First, we construct a measure of neighborhood-level viability, calibrated with real-world data for the city of New Orleans. Second, we construct and evaluate a neighborhood development model to maximize the total viability of neighborhoods by optimally assigning land uses subject to budget, contiguity and spatial orientation constraints.
