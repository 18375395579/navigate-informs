The approach, however, is not always appropriate for modeling service operations; it cannot help with detailed decisions about the layout of services such as retail outlets and airports. A mixed discrete-event and agent based simulation approach is proposed for modeling such systems. The approach will be demonstrated through a simple model of a coffee shop.</br>
