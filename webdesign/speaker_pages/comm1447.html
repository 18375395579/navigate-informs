Title: Modeling Service Operations: A Mixed Discrete-Event and Agent Based Simulation Approach<br>Author: Stewart Robinson, Professor of Management Science, Loughborough University, School of Business and Economics, Loughborough, LE11 3TU, United Kingdom, S.L.Robinson@lboro.ac.uk<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Discrete-event simulation, which has grown out of modeling manufacturing systems, has increasingly been applied in the service sector. The approach, however, is not always appropriate for modeling service operations; it cannot help with detailed decisions about the layout of services such as retail outlets and airports. A mixed discrete-event and agent based simulation approach is proposed for modeling such systems. The approach will be demonstrated through a simple model of a coffee shop.
