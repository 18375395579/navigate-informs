<br>Title: An Approximate DP approach to Network RM: Separable Approximations</br><br>Author: Vivek Farias, Graduate Student, Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, 274 Packard Electrical Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, vivekf@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Van Roy</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We explore the use of separable approximations to the value function in the computation of dynamic bid prices for network RM problems. Our approximation is computed via the solution of a single LP at the start of the sales season. Bid prices computed via this technique consistently generate between 1-6% higher revenues than bid prices computed via the re-solution of the standard bid price LP at each time step as well as bid prices computed via an affine approximation to the value function.</br>
