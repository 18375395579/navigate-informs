Title: Pricing and Revenue Optimization under a New Discrete Choice Model<br>Author: John Semple, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, United States of America, jsemple@cox.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Aydin Alptekinoglu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the pricing and revenue implications associated with a new discrete choice model based on ideal utilities. The model’s structure produces a variety of clean analytical results and makes estimation with real data easy. We use the new choice model to estimate optimal revenues and optimal prices for a number of product assortments using data supplied by the company that initiated the project.
