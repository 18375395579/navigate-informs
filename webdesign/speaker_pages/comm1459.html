Title: Width-Constrained Reserve Design<br>Author: Rachel St John, PhD Student, University of Washington, Box 352650, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, rkrieg@uw.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sandor Toth<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In wildlife conservation, it is imperative to provide corridors between patches of critical habitat. Current reserve selection models do not have the ability to control corridor width, a critical aspect particularly for large mammals. I will introduce a new optimization model that utilizes an algorithm from computational geometry in order to incorporate corridor width.  An illustrative example will be used to demonstrate an application, validate the approach and to compare it to previous models.
