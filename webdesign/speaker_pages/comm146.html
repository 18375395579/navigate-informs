Title: Real Options and Grid Computing<br>Author: Shubho Bandyopadhyay, University of Florida, 364 STZ Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, shubho.bandyopadhyay@cba.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Selwyn Piramuthu, Juheng Zhang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Grid computing essentially involves transparent access to distributed computing where computing resources are pooled and shared.  We study the economics of grid computing from a provider's perspective using real options for valuing strategic investment decisions. We model the consumer's choices and find the maximum price she will be willing to pay for the provider's service. The provider then uses this price to decide on his buy versus rent decisions for the grid computing infrastructure.
