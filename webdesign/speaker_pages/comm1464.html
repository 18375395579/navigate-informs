Title: Review of Systems Models Linking Economics and Engineering Design in Automotive Policy Analysis<br>Author: Steven Skerlos, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 2350 Hayward Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, skerlos@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ross Morrow<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Determination of optimal greenhouse gas emissions policies for the automotive sector requires systems analysis methods to evaluate policies for their impact on future emissions profiles and costs to society. We review two approaches toward this end ?economic equilibrium modeling and technology studies ?and highlight the importance of integrating economics and design in determining plausible forecasts of future emissions profiles.
