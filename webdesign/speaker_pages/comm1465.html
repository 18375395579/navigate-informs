Title: Gender and Performance in Risky Situations<br>Author: Susan Fisk, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, Sociology Deparment, Building 120, Room 031, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, sfisk@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ross Shachter<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We explore the role gender plays in risk-taking, using data from a large undergraduate decision analysis class in which the midterm uses a probabilistic scoring rule but the final exam does not. Controlling for academic major, we find that women take fewer risks than men, confirming established research on gender and risk-taking. In addition, we find that women perform worse on exams when their grade is determined by the scoring rule instead of conventional grading methods.
