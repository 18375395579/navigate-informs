Title: Warranty Inventory Optimization for Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Inc.<br>Author: John Khawam, Graduate Student, Management Science & Engineering Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, jkhawam@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Hausman<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Warranty inventory must cope with random replacement demands and three sources of resupply with differing lead times: no defect found (NDF), remanufacturing of returned units, and purchase of new product. By modeling NDF and Remanufacturing as negative demand, we create a heuristic order-up-to inventory model for this setting and use the model to show the payoffs from reducing lead times and reducing batching in remanufacturing. We also describe who the customer is, how and why the work was initiated, who the users are, and how the results are applied in practice.
