Title: Getting the Right Mix of Experts<br>Author: Jason Merrick, Virginia Commonwealth University, 1001 W Main Street (PO Box 843083), Richmond, VA, 23230, United States, jrmerric@vcu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a Bayesian approach to aggregating expert judgment that treats the experts?judgments as if they were drawn from Lindley's hierarchical mixture, but we treat the mixing distribution non-parametrically with a Dirichlet process. This makes our overall model a Dirichlet process mixture. One interesting feature of this approach is that the decision maker's posterior need not be a uni-modal distribution lying between the experts' assessed distribution, but can be multi-modal.
