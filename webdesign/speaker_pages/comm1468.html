Title: Modeling Mitigation: The Case of Katrina<br>Author: Carl Southwell, Research Assistant, University of Southern California, University Park, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, southwel@usc.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This presentation describes a model to evaluate alternative strategies to rebuild and reconfigure the flood and hurricane protection structures in New Orleans.  Using influence diagrams, we consider various reinforcement designs and exceedence and breach probabilities.  Several strategies, using both hard (i.e., levees and floodwalls) and soft structures (i.e., wetlands reconstruction), are considered.
