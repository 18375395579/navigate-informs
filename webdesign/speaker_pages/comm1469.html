Title: The Cost Effectiveness of Screening Newborns for Genetic Diseases Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry<br>Author: Greg Zaric, Professor, Ivey School of Business, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, gzaric@ivey.uwo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Tony Rupar, Lauren Cipriano<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We developed a model to investigate the health effects, costs and cost effectiveness of using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to screen for bundles of up to 21 diseases. We found that it is not cost effective to use MS/MS to screen for a single disease, but there are many bundles of diseases for which the average cost effectiveness is between $50,000 and $100,000 per life year gained. It is not cost effective to screen for all diseases that can be tested for using MS/MS.
