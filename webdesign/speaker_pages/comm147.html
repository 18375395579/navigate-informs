Title: Risk Evaluation for System Reliability Demonstration Testing with Reliability Information Fusion<br>Author: Mingyang Li, Research Assistant, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States of America, mingyangli@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jian Liu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The large sample size required for demonstrating high system reliability is often unaffordable. To reduce the sample size, existing approaches mainly focus on utilizing a single source of information based on certain risk evaluation criterion. This paper proposes an information fusion approach by systematically utilizing multiple sources of reliability information. Different risk evaluation criteria are analytically compared with the closed-form conditions obtained.
