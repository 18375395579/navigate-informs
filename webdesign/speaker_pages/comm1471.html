Mahmassani</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Conceptual and methodological aspects of a scenario-based approach for predicting reliability levels in evaluating transportation alternatives are presented.  The methodology is applied in connection with a simulation-based DTA tool, specifically the impact of incidents and weather on the variation of travel times.</br>
