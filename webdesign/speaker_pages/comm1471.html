Title: Scenario-based Approach to Reliability Modeling using Traffic Simulation Tools<br>Author: Jiwon Kim, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, JiwonKim2012@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hani S. Mahmassani<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Conceptual and methodological aspects of a scenario-based approach for predicting reliability levels in evaluating transportation alternatives are presented.  The methodology is applied in connection with a simulation-based DTA tool, specifically the impact of incidents and weather on the variation of travel times.
