Title: Performance Analysis and Design Tradeoffs in Warehouses with Autonomous Vehicle Technology<br>Author: Ananth Krishnamurthy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, ME 3258, Madison, WI, United States of America, ananth@engr.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sunderesh Heragu, Debjit Roy, Charles Malmborg<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Autonomous vehicle based storage and retrieval systems present a potential alternative to the traditional technologies used for unit-load warehouse operations. We investigate the performance impact of design decisions such as the configuration of aisles and columns, allocation of resources to zones, and vehicle assignment rules using multi-class semi-open queuing network models. The models are solved using decomposition-based approaches to provide insights useful in design conceptualization.
