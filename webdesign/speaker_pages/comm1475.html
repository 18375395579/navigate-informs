Norman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This study presents a multiobjective model for the spatial design of a retail store. The model combines ideas from both the shelf space allocation and the facility layout literature. The model considers the revenue and the adjacency requirements among departments. The revenue aspect consists both of department size and department exposure to the main traffic patterns of the customers. Therefore, the problem includes several objectives along with constraints on the departments and on the aisling.</br>
