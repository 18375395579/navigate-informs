Title: Bayesian Parametric and Semi-parametric Modeling of Call Center Abandonment<br>Author: Tevfik Aktekin, Assistant Professor of Decision Sciences, University of New Hampshire, 15 Academic Way, Durham, NH, 03824, United States of America, Tevfik.Aktekin@unh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Refik Soyer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the modeling and inference of abandonment behavior in call centers. We present different family of distributions, piecewise time to abandonment, mixtures and semi-parametric models, develop Bayesian inference for posterior and predictive analyses with censored abandonment and discuss implications on staffing. We use real call center data, present additional insights that can be obtained from the Bayesian analysis and discuss implications for different customer profiles.
