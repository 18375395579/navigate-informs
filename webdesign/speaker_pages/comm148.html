Title: Estimating A Composite Measure of Hospital Quality From the Hospital Compare Database<br>Author: Justin Ren, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA, United States of America, ren@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xin Wang, Erol Pekoz, Mike Shwartz, Joe Restuccia, Alan Cohen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A single composite measure calculated from individual quality indicators is a useful measure of hospital performance and can be justified conceptually even when the indicators are not highly correlated with one another. In this research, we compare two basic approaches for calculating a composite measure:  an extension of the most widely-used approach, which weights individual indicators based on the number of people eligible for the indicator, and a Bayesian hierarchical latent variable model.
