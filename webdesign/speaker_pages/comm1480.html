To maximize revenue, these systems use historical data. However, due to booking limits, registered reservations do not represent the real demand. We represent a non-parametric approach which is able to model demand by using choice probabilities. Our proposed model is able to extract seasonal features of demand and customer utilities for a given product. The precision of results has been verified by both synthetic and real data.</br>
