Title: Semiparametric Bayesian Decision Models<br>Author: Refik Soyer, George Washington University, Decision Sciences Dept Funger Hall  415, School of Business, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, soyer@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jason Merrick<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a semi-parametric model to describe failure characteristics of a system. Using a gamma process prior for the cumulative intensity function complicates the Bayesian analysis when the updating is based on failure count data. We develop a Bayesian analysis using MCMC methods and determine replacement strategies. Adoption of MCMC methods involves a data augmentation algorithm. We show the use of our approach with actual data.
