Title: Human Behavior Representation in Physical Security Systems Simulation<br>Author: Volkan Ustun, Auburn University, 207 Dunstan Hall, Auburn, AL, 36849, United States, ustunvo@auburn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Smith<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Realistic and credible agent-based simulations of physical security systems require incorporation of human behavior models for an effective agent model. Operating / patrol strategies of these agents must explicitly include situational awareness, cooperative team behavior, planning and deliberative decision-making processes to improve realism, credibility, and variability. In this talk, we discuss and demonstrate our design for the computational behavior representation for agents.
