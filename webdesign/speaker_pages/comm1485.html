Title: On Quantifying the Benefits of Coordinating OR Capacity Management<br>Author: Fei Li, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street S. E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, lixxx768@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Diwakar Gupta<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is intended to align health care providers?and suppliers?incentives to provide patients the right care at the right time. Payment mechanisms will reward providers for better health outcomes, rather than for the volume of services provided. We develop models to quantify the benefits that may accrue from more efficient use of OR capacity when hospital and physician incentives are aligned. These models are tested on sample data from a community hospital.
