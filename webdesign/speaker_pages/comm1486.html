Title: Static Hedging of Barrier Options under Zero-drift CEV<br>Author: Sergey Nadtochiy, Princeton University, snadtoch@Princeton.EDU<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the underlying given by the Constant Elasticity Volatility model with zero drift, and derive the analytical solution for the problem of static hedging of barrier options in this model, using the theory of generalized functional transforms. We also provide the approximation of the above hedging strategy through the use vanilla options only, and test its performance under more general models.
