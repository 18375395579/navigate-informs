In this work, we present a quantitative evaluation and comparison of two prognostic models, namely, the degradation-signal based model and the Cox proportional hazard model based prognosis. We analyzed two models, and provided rigorous comparison results. They have been demonstrated through not only an analytic study, but also an extensive simulations followed by a practical case study using real data from the industry.</br>
