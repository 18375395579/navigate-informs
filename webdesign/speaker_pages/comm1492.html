Title: On the Vulnerability Assessment for Independent and Interdependent Networks<br>Author: Yilin Shen, PhD Candidate, CISE Department, University of Florida, 296 Diamond Village, APT 9, Gainesville, FL, 32603, United States of America, yshen@cise.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): My Thai<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The assessment of network vulnerability is of great importance in the presence of unexpected disruptive events targeting in critical network nodes. In this talk, we focus on identifying critical nodes in a network and an interdependent system, whose removals maximally destroy the network’s functions. We provide a comprehensive complexity analysis of both problems, along with two efficient frameworks, a novel LP-based rounding algorithm, and a greedy framework with novel centrality functions.
