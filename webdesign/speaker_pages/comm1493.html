Title: Using Cross Entropy Methods to Determine Reliable Link Routes in MANETs<br>Author: Ivan Guardiola, Assistant Professor, Missouri University of Science and Technology, 600 W. 14th Street, Rolla, MO, 65409, United States of America, guardiolai@mst.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Schaefer, Shikhar Acharya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This presentation highlights the use of the Cross Entropy Method to determine the most reliable link routes within a Rayleigh Fading envelop. We use the cross entropy method as a mean to simulate and optimize received signal power in order to determine the least interference route in a network.
