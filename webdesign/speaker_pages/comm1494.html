Title: Modeling and Validating Multi-period, Multi-type, and Multi-target Attacker-defender Games<br>Author: Jing Zhang, University at Buffalo, 338 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, United States of America, jzhang42@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhuang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a novel class of multi-period and multi-target attacker-defender games where the attacker has multiple attacking types including assassination, armed assault, bombing/explosion, facility/infrastructure attack, hijacking, and hostage taking. We validate this model using terrorism and defensive investment data including Global Terrorism Database and Urban Areas Security Initiative programs. This research provides some new insights on modeling and validating models of adaptive adversary.
