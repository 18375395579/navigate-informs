We present a new, more holistic approach to underground mine planning by incorporating ventilation, resulting in a large-scale integer optimization model that maximizes discounted gold extraction. Constraints include typical (linear) precedence and resource capacities, and ventilation capacities. We provide preliminary computational results.</br>
