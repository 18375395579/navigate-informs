Further, when multiple designs must be compared, then the total number of samples across all designs can be prohibitively high. We present a new approach to enhance the efficiency of rare-event simulation. Our approach integrates the ideas of level splitting and optimal computing budget allocation to optimize efficiency across multiple designs.</br>
