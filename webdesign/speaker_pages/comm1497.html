Title: Optimal Computing Allocation for Rare-Event Decision Problems<br>Author: John F. Shortle, George Mason University, 4400 University Dr., MS 4A6, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, jshortle@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chun-Hung Chen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Computing time can be a concern when using simulation to estimate rare-event probabilities, since a huge number of simulation replications may be needed. Further, when multiple designs must be compared, then the total number of samples across all designs can be prohibitively high. We present a new approach to enhance the efficiency of rare-event simulation. Our approach integrates the ideas of level splitting and optimal computing budget allocation to optimize efficiency across multiple designs.
