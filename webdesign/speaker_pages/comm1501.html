Title: Management of Systems' Development under Tight Constraints: A Principal-agent Approach<br>Author: Elisabeth Pat?Cornell, Professor and chair, Stanford University, Terman Building Room 340, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, mep@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Russ Garber<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a model of system development under tight resource constraints as a game between a manager and an employee or a contractor. To assess the effects on system failure risks of some management decisions and of corner-cutting on the part of the agent, we use both a principal-agent model and a probabilistic risk analysis of system failure.
