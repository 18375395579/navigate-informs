Elsayed, Abdelmajid Hamouda, Khalifa Al-Khalifa, Wook-Yeon Hwang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An adaptive step-down procedure using conditional T^2 statistics is proposed for fault variable identification. The procedure selects a variable having no significant evidence of a change at each step based on the variables that are selected in previous steps. The selected variables are useful to construct powerful conditional T^2 test statistics for identifying the shifted components of the mean vector when a shift occurs only in a few variables.
