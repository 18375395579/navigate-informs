After surgery patients are at risk for recurrence. We use our Monte Carlo simulation model to optimize surveillance strategies for recurrence considering objectives including minimizing cost, minimizing time to recurrence diagnosis, and minimizing radiation exposure. We present numerical results comparing the optimal strategies to published guidelines.</br>
