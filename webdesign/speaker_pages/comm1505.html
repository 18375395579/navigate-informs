Title: Optimization of Surveillance Strategies for Secondary Renal Cell Carcinoma<br>Author: Jennifer Mason, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia, P.O. Box 800717, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, United States of America, jem4yb@virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tracey Krupski<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Renal cell carcinoma is the most common form of kidney cancer, often requiring surgical removal of part or the entire affected kidney. After surgery patients are at risk for recurrence. We use our Monte Carlo simulation model to optimize surveillance strategies for recurrence considering objectives including minimizing cost, minimizing time to recurrence diagnosis, and minimizing radiation exposure. We present numerical results comparing the optimal strategies to published guidelines.
