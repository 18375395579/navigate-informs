Title: Condition-based Maintenance for Multiple Stents with Stochastic Dependent Failure Processes<br>Author: Elias Keedy, University of Houston, Houston, United States of America, eliekeedy@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Qianmei Feng, Koosha Rafiee, David Coit<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Based on the physics-of-failure of stents, we develop a system reliability model that considers the stochastic processes for two dependent failure processes in a multi-stent system in human arteries. System reliability functions are derived for two patient groups with different activity levels. Condition-based maintenance models are developed to minimize the impact of failures of stents. In-vitro fatigue testing data will be presented to analyze the crack growth of this emerging technology.
