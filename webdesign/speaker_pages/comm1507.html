<br>Title: Estimating and Benchmarking Less Than Truckload (LTL) Market Rates</br><br>Author: Evren Ozkaya, Ph.D Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 251 10th Street NW A-702, Atlanta, GA, 30318, United States, evren@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pinar Keskinocak, Ryan Weight</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this study we propose a robust methodology to estimate Less-than-Truckload (LTL) market rates and a process to benchmark LTL shipments based on historical data. We implemented the process using SAS with MS Access user interface and tested with real world data. Study reveals interesting patterns of the realized market rates.</br>
