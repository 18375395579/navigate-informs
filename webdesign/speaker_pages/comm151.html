Uncertainty in data occurs due to many reasons, one of them being that the data comes from a prediction model. We consider an integer-programming problem with uncertain cost coefficients, where the coefficients come from a prediction model. We propose a robust formulation, which uses simulated values of the cost coefficients, to optimize for the near worst-value of the objective function.
