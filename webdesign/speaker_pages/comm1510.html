Title: Online Monitoring and Prediction of Complex Time Series Events<br>Author: Shouyi Wang, University of Washington, 3311 NE 65TH Street, Seattle, WA, 98115, United States of America, shouyi@uw.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Art Chaovalitwongse<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This talk presents a new general framework for online monitoring and prediction of complex time series events from nonstationary and chaotic time series data. The proposed prediction approach adapts and innovates data mining and adaptive learning concepts to analyze time series data, and creates a set of innovative analysis methods to reveal hidden temporal patterns that are characteristic and predictive of time series events.
