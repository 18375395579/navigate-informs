Title: Productivity of Tuberculosis Control<br>Author: Stephen Resch, PhD Candidate, Harvard University, 718 Huntington, Boston, MA, 02115, United States, resch@fas.harvard.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Milton Weinstein, Megan Murray, Joshua Salomon<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Endemic TB is a major public health problem in dozens of nations, killing an estimated 2 million people per year. Policymakers face a decision regarding how to distribute available resources across sequentially connected components of TB control programs: population coverage, case recruitment, diagnosis, and treatment. With an objective of minimizing deaths, we explore tradeoffs in allocating resources across these program activities using a state-transition model and deterministic simulation.
