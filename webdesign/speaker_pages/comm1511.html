Policymakers face a decision regarding how to distribute available resources across sequentially connected components of TB control programs: population coverage, case recruitment, diagnosis, and treatment. With an objective of minimizing deaths, we explore tradeoffs in allocating resources across these program activities using a state-transition model and deterministic simulation.</br>
