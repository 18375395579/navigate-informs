One didactic approach is to make the students implement the method considered in the lecture on their own. A popular type of software used for this purpose is the spreadsheet. ExcelTutor was designed to help students learn the necessary steps to compute the results of a method using a spreadsheet. ExcelTutor verifies the correctness of the final results and provides feedback on the time needed.</br>
