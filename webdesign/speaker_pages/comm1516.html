We construct an algorithm for a fleet of PEVs that efficiently organizes distributed electricity trading to benefit consumers and utilities. A robust linear programming model of the fleet can be used by an aggregator to allocate energy exchange schedules to vehicles instantly as they plug-in. The resulting schedules are robust to uncertain driving behavior. We give empirical results using real data.</br>
