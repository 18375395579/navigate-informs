Bodea</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Mixed models with error components are approximate correlation structures of GEV models. Convergence of mixed models and recovery this structure depends critically on the number of observations, the frequency of chosen alternatives, and the correlation in the nests. Even when convergence is reached, we observe systematic bias in correlation estimates.</br>
