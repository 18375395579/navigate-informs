Title: Approximation of GEV Models Using Mixed Models with Error Components<br>Author: Laurie Garrow, Assistant Professor, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 790 Atlantic Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, laurie.garrow@ce.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tudor D. Bodea<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Mixed models with error components are approximate correlation structures of GEV models. Convergence of mixed models and recovery this structure depends critically on the number of observations, the frequency of chosen alternatives, and the correlation in the nests. Even when convergence is reached, we observe systematic bias in correlation estimates.
