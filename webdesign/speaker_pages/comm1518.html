The manufacturer has two options for collection, either he collects used products himself or delegates the collection activity to the retailer. The collecting party can use two different approaches for used product collection: (i) drop-off (ii) pick-up.  We show that manufacturer's optimal reverse channel choice depends on the collection strategy used.</br>
