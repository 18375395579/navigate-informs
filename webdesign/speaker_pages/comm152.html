Title: Local Recurrence Modeling for State and Performance Prediction of Nonlinear and Nonstationary Process<br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Oklahoma State University, EN 322, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, satish.t.bukkapatnam@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hui Yang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A local recurrence modeling approach that considers the underlying nonlinear stochastic dynamics and nonstationarities is presented for predicting the state and performance of complex manufacturing systems. The local recurrence characteristics, exhibited over certain sets of time, are used to partition a system trajectory into multiple near-stationary segments. The simulation studies and real world application show significant prediction accuracy improvement compared to stationary predictors.
