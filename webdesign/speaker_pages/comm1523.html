<br>Title: Efficiency-based Quantitative Currency Selection</br><br>Author: Irene Song, Columbia University, Columbia University, 120 Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, is2306@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Iraj Kani, Soulaymane Kachani</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we propose an efficiency-based currency selection methodology that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA), a non-parametric productivity analysis of relative efficiencies of economic entities, with fundamental analysis in a disciplined manner.  Using this methodology, we construct and analyze several representative structural exchange rate models, including flexible-price monetary model, sticky-price monetary model, trade-weighted dollar model and their extensions.</br>
