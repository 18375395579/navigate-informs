We use the model to estimate the impact of SSM on performance, compared to ambulances returning to their home station at the conclusion of every call. Using data from a Canadian city, we estimate that the percentage of high priority calls reached in 9 minutes would drop from 85% to 77% if SSM were no longer used.</br>
