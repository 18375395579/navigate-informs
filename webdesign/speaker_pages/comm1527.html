Some qualitative insights about the interaction between inspector fallibility, risk preferences, and optimal inspection decisions are derived from analytics assuming risk-neutrality and simulation under risk-aversion. Also, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to make statistical inferences about unobserved inspection errors that are critical to the inspection policy design.</br>
