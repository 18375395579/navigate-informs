Title: A Framework for Variation Visualization and Understanding in Complex Manufacturing Systems<br>Author: Fadel Megahed, Assistant Professor, Auburn University, 3301L Shelby Center, Auburn, Al, United States of America, fmegahed@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jaime Camelio, William Woodall, Lee Wells<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We provide a framework that allows industrial practitioners to visualize the most significant variation patterns. In essence, this framework complements Phase I techniques by enabling users to: (1) acquire detailed understanding of common-cause variability; (2) quickly visualize the effects of common-cause variability in a process with respect to the final product; and (3) identify opportunities for process improvement. The framework is illustrated through a case study.
