In recent years, they have been used in system reliability and prediction for complex systems.  Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is increasingly important in today’s complex systems. PHM is the capability to make decisions about maintenance, based on prognostics information, resources, and operational conditions. We will provide an introduction to flowgraph models and discuss their applicability as a PHM tool.</br>
