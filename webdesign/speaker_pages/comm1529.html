Title: Flowgraph Models for PHM in Complex Systems<br>Author: Aparna Huzurbazar, Technical Staff Member, Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS-F600, Los Alamos, NM, 87545, United States, aparna@stat.unm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Valerie Peters<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Flowgraph models are especially useful for analyzing time-to-event data. In recent years, they have been used in system reliability and prediction for complex systems.  Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is increasingly important in today’s complex systems. PHM is the capability to make decisions about maintenance, based on prognostics information, resources, and operational conditions. We will provide an introduction to flowgraph models and discuss their applicability as a PHM tool.
