Title: Applying the Power of Transform Theory to Utility Theory<br>Author: Ronald Howard, Stanford University, 646 Tennyson Ave., Palo Alto, CA, 94301, rhoward@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ali Abbas, Jim Matheson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Transform theory revolutionized electrical and control engineering but has seen little use in Decision Theory. Exponential transforms convert the convolution into a simple multiplication. The basic operation of calculating certain equivalents can be treated with transform theory. This allows transforms of common probability distributions and utility functions to be used to calculate certain equivalents. We present applications to sensitivity analysis, block diagrams, and multiple attributes.
