Exponential transforms convert the convolution into a simple multiplication. The basic operation of calculating certain equivalents can be treated with transform theory. This allows transforms of common probability distributions and utility functions to be used to calculate certain equivalents. We present applications to sensitivity analysis, block diagrams, and multiple attributes.</br>
