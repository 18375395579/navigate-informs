Title: Error-resistant Spreadsheet Design<br>Author: David Cawlfield, Principal Engineering, Olin Corporation, 1186 Lower River Rd, Charleston, TN, 37310-0248, United States of America, DWCawlfield@olin.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Spreadsheet application development can benefit from the principle of reusable components, just as object-oriented programming has done in the development of procedural languages.  The author has pioneered the development and use of re-useable spreadsheet modules in technical and business applications at Olin Corporation. Methods used to separate input from analysis will be discussed which  use little or no VBA code.  Examples will demonstrate how these features greatly enhance re-useability.
