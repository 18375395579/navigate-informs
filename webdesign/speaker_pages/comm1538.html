We expand on the clone-end sequencing approach for detecting structural variants  by building an automated, probabilistic framework.  Our approach does not rely on an a priori determined mapping of all reads to the reference. Instead, we build a framework for finding the most probable assignment of clones to potential structural variants based on their similarity to other clones.</br>
