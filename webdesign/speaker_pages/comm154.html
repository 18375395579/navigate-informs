However, there is currently conflicting evidence and several unanswered questions regarding which inhibitor is most effective for use in post menopausal patients. In this study, our aim is to design effective 5-year drug treatment plans considering Tamoxifen and AIs for postmenopausal women with breast cancer using integer programming techniques.</br>
