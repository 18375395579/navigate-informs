<br>Title: Developing Forecasting Tools for Arson and Other Kinds of Human-caused Fires on Tribal Lands</br><br>Author: Jeffrey P. Prestemon, USDA Forest Service, RTP, NC, United States of America, jprestemon@fs.fed.us</br><br>Coauthor(s): David T. Butry, Douglas Thomas, Sam Scranton</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Alternative statistical time series forecast models of human-ignited wildfires on tribal lands of the United States indicate that arson and some human-caused fires are forecastable using Autoregressive Conditional Poisson (ACP) models (Heinen and Rengifo 2003). In out-of-sample data conditions, these models outperform plausible forecast model alternatives, including a naïve random walk and those based on crime hotspotting tools (e.g., CompStat). ACP models could be used to aid in tactical responses to wildfire outbreaks by law enforcement and firefighting organizations. We report model specifications at the weekly time step for individual tribal land units. Exogenous predictors include the most recent weeks?counts of fires, seasonality, and weather variables. Such simple specifications facilitate their implementation because of their low data demands, while the weekly time step provides time for resource reallocations.</br>
