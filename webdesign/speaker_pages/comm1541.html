<br>Title: Easing Rescheduling Complexity for a Bulk Gas Production and Distribution Problem</br><br>Author: Wasu Glankwamdee, Lehigh University, 200 W. Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, wag3@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Linderoth, Jierui Shen, Jackie Griffin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper demonstrates the impact of different planning models within a large industrial gas company for its production and distribution during the course of a month. We build an optimization model approximating the model in place at the company and a simulation mechanism that allows us to create instances of varying time-granularities. Computational results are given to reveal the best course of action that minimizes the frequency and severity of intra-month schedule adjustments.</br>
