<br>Title: Integer Programming Formulations for Optimizing Throughput in the Hunter Valley Coal Chain</br><br>Author: Mohsen Reisi, PhD Student, The University of Newcastle, University Drive, Callaghan, 2287, Australia, mohsen.reisi@uon.edu.au</br><br>Coauthor(s): Natashia Boland, Martin Savelsbergh</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The Hunter Valley Coal Chain is the world's largest coal export operation. An IP formulation is introduced to find the optimal way of providing coal for customers minimizing the total delay. Next, an aggregated IP model is developed that contains fewer variables and breaks the symmetry inherent in the first model. Referring to Hall’s marriage theorem, a large number of inequalities is required in the aggregated model, thus a separation algorithm is used to add those few that are violated.</br>
