Title: Platform Identification Using Data Mining for Product Family Design<br>Author: Seung Ki Moon, Graduate Research Assistant, The Pennsylvania State University, 233 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, sum143@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy W.

Fuzzy c-means clustering is used to determine initial clusters based on the similarity among functional features. The clustering result is identified as the platform and the modules by a fuzzy membership function and classification. We apply the proposed methodology to determine a new platform using a case study involving a single-use camera family.
