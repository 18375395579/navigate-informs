Title: A Study of the Efficiency and Accuracy of Data Stream Clustering for Large Data Sets<br>Author: Michael Hahsler, Southern Methodist University, P. O. Box 750123, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States of America, mhahsler@lyle.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Bolanos<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Clustering large data sets is important for many data mining applications. Conventional clustering approaches (k-means, hierarchical clustering, etc.) typically do not scale well for very large data sets. We will investigate the use of data stream clustering algorithms as light-weight alternatives to conventional algorithms on large non-streaming data using several synthetic and real-world data sets.
