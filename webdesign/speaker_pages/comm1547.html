Title: Robust Experimental Design: Optimal Assignment for Powerful Inference<br>Author: Nathan Kallus, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, kallus@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas, Mac Johnson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Random assignment, typically seen as the standard in controlled trials, aims to make experimental groups statistically equivalent before treatment. However, with a small sample, which is a practical reality in many disciplines, randomized groups are often too dissimilar to be useful. We propose an optimal assignment mechanism based on regression robustness that offers theoretically-motivated, powerful statistical inference and estimation.
