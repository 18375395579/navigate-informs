Title: A Review of Integrated Optimization-simulation Approaches to Solve Distribution Problems<br>Author: Xu Yang, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Louisville, Department of Industrial Engineering, J B Speed School of Engineering, Louisville, KY, 40292, United States of America, x0yang07@gwise.louisville.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gerald W Evans, Sunderesh S Heragu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We review recent work on using integrated approaches of optimization and simulation to solve distribution problem involving truck transportation, and identify important area where further research is needed. Optimization and simulation models are examples of approaches taken by companies as an attempt to improve their operational behavior and remain in the market place. We review and classify over 100 papers in the areas of optimization and/or simulation modeling of distribution problems.
