Title: Understanding the Performance of Email Processing Strategies in a Network of Knowledge Workers<br>Author: Ashish Gupta, Assisstant Professor, Minnesota State University Moorhead, School of Business, 1104 7th Ave South, Moorhead, MN, 56563, United States, gupta@mnstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ramesh Sharda<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: While emails have improved the communication effectiveness of knowledge workers, they have also started to negatively impact their productivity due to increased interruptions, overwhelming volumes and inefficient use. This study uses a computational modeling approach to understand how various combinations of timing-based and frequency-based email processing strategies adopted within different types of knowledge networks can influence the performance of entire network of knowledge workers.
