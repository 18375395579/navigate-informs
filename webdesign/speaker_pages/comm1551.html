<br>Title: Modeling Large-scale Penetration of Renewable Energy in the MIT EPPA Model: A Decomposition Approach</br><br>Author: Claudia Octaviano, Research Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E19-411, Cambridge, MA, 02139, Mexico, claus@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mort Webster, Jose Ignacio Perez-Arriaga</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A generation capacity expansion model, which includes the main constraints for a reliable and secure operation of power systems, as well as demand, wind and solar resources at the hourly time-scale, and a simplified transmission formulation, is coupled to the MIT EPPA model, a recursive-dynamic multi-regional general equilibrium model of the world economy for climate change policy analysis.  We use Boehringer and Rutherford’s decomposition algorithm, and Mexico as a case study.</br>
