With Massey Rankings, and developing new variations of this method, we can make predictions based solely on the premise of a team’s past score differentials. In reality, however, sports teams?successes are a culmination of style of play, momentum, rivalry, home advantage, and countless other ‘human?factors. Only some of these numerous factors can be quantified and analyzed, but consolidating them into a single quantity can limit many of the accessible trends in the data. This work addresses strategies used in targeting some of these factors and maintaining them as unique and independent strata of data to compare NCAA basketball teams and to predict the winners of season matches. Using some select statistics, analyzing both the offensive and defensive style of each team, we developed a search-engine-like method to identify a team’s neighborhood of other teams most similar in style of play; then, when analyzing a match-up between teams, we look at the opponents?pools of similar teams and their collective histories to predict the winner of the face-offs. Combined with the ranking methods, we included other factors into a linear regression—in this way, we redefined ‘victory?as the resultant of many influences, aiming to more realistically model and predict sports matches, and slightly increased the accuracy of head-to-head match predictions.
