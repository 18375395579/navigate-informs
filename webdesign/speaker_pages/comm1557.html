GAMS/MPSGE provides a tabular, non-algebraic modeling format which automates calibration and reduces the scope for errors in model specification.  A new open source implementation of MPSGE, written in GAMS, accommodates optimal taxation, embedded gams-theoretic models and models with growth, infrastructure or pollution externalities.</br>
