The RTOM is presented with an illustration of the approach. Applications of RTOM are described and illustrated using track data fusion of X-Band Radars. It is shown that the use of RTOM provides a key ingredient to allow sensors to work as a unit in a coordinated manner with direct communications between them and with the fire units under C2BMC control.</br>
