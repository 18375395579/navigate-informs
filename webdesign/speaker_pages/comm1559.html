<br>Title: Combining Probability Forecasts</br><br>Author: Roopesh Ranjan, Graduate Student, University of Washington, BOX-354322, Dept. of Statistics, Seattle, WA, 98105, United States of America, roopesh@stat.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tilmann Gneiting</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a method for combining probability forecasts from different sources. The commonly used method of linearly combining probability forecasts has limitations, in that a weighted combination of distinct calibrated forecasts is necessarily uncalibrated.In view of this, we propose a recalibration method. We illustrate our findings with simulation examples and a case study on operational probability of precipitation forecasts.</br>
