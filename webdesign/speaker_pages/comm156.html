Title: Calibrating an Access-purpose Gravity Model for Cyclist Trip Distributions<br>Author: Jeffrey LaMondia, Assistant Professor, Auburn University, 238 Harbert Engineering Center, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849, United States of America, jlamondia@auburn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nathan Moore<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Understanding where cyclists prefer to travel is a critical part of developing bicycle networks.  This study uses trip diary records from the 2008 Chicago Travel Tracker Survey to calculate a scalable gravity model function to forecast cyclists?movements over a variety of trip purposes.  The model includes a series of accessibility-characteristics, such as zone development and activity opportunities, elevation changes, traffic patterns, distances, and the existence of bicycle facilities.
