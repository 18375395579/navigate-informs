Evans, Mr, University of Cambridge, 1-5 Scroope Terrace, Cambridge, CB, CB4-3AL, United Kingdom, ade26@cam.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andreas Schafer, Tom Reynolds, Maria Vera-Morales, Lynnette Dray, Steven Barrett</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Growth in the world economy and aviation have occurred in unison. Significant further growth is anticipated, along with an increase in energy use and associated emissions. The Aviation Integrated Modelling (AIM) project develops an integrated assessment model to enable analysis of aviation, environment and economic interactions at local and global levels. Operations research methods are used extensively, and particularly in the estimation of future air traffic given airport capacity constraints.</br>
