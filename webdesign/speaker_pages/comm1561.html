<br>Title: Deformable Models and Energy Minimization for Medical Image Segmentation</br><br>Author: Xiaolei Huang, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Lehigh University, 19 Memorial Drive West, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, huang@cse.lehigh.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present deformable models that integrate shape and appearance for reliably locating object boundaries in medical images.  The models are energy- minimizing, smooth splines that are pulled toward boundary features by external image forces. The image forces are derived in a variational framework that consists of edge-based and region-based energy terms, both differentiable w.r.t. deformation parameters. We show the effectiveness of the models using organ and tumor segmentation examples.</br>
