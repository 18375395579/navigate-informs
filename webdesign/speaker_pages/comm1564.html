We find U.S. consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is $13,000?17,000 lower than conventional vehicles (CVs) with identical attributes, while Chinese WTP is within $2,000. Current U.S. subsidies are sufficient to drive mainstream adoption of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and insufficient for BEVs; current Chinese subsidies imply the opposite.
