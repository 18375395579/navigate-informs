Title: Efficient Portfolio Risk Modeling under Uncertainty<br>Author: Andrew Barnes, Researcher, Quantitative Methods, General Electric Global Research, 1 Research Circle, K1 4A58, Niskayuna, NY, 12309, United States of America, barnesa@research.ge.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine portfolio risk models in the face of uncertainty. Many high level portfolio management decisions can only be made in the face of large uncertainties. In this context, it is not helpful to build overly complex risk models, where a lot of the  complexity is lost in the overall noise. We present a simple, efficient analytical framework for portfolio risk analysis and show that this framework enables sensitivity analysis as well as insight into the main drivers of portfolio risk problems.
