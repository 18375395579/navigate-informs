Title: Integrated Process Planning and Supply Chain Configuration Using Petri Nets<br>Author: Oleg Gusikhin, Ford Research & Advanced Engineering, RIC Building, Room 3011, MD 2122, 2101 Village Rd, Dearborn, MI, 48124, ogusikhi@ford.com<br>Coauthor(s): Erica Klampfl<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a Petri Net-based approach automating the MIP formulation of the Supply Chain configuration problem with alternative assembly sequences.  We start with a Petri Net model of the assembly processes, which unfolds into the Supply Chain model.  The MIP formulation is based on the matrix representation of this model.
