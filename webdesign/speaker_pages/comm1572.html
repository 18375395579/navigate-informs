The first is a two-stage stochastic linear program with binary decisions in the first stage. The second is a robust counter-part, in which the objective is to minimize the maximum cost associated with an uncertainty set for surgery durations. We describe the mathematical models, structural properties, methodologies employed, and sample numerical results based on real data to contrast the two models.
