We describe a model treating the uncertainty in wind as a Markov Chain and the short-term operation of electricity plant as an average reward MDP. This problem’s LP formulation can be augmented by binary variables defining investment actions, leading to a mixed-integer program. The impact of increasing wind penetration on generation and transmission investments is explored.</br>
