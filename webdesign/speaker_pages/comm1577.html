Title: A Methodology for Exploring Force Composition using the Peace Support Operations Model<br>Author: Alejandro Hernandez, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, 777 Dyer Road, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, ahernand@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mary McDonald, Julian Ouellet<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We demonstrate a robust, repeatable methodology that addresses questions of force sufficiency (size, structure, capability).   Though model-agnostic, this application employed the Peace Support Operations Model, recently used to support real-time planning in Afghanistan.  We demonstrate a post-game analysis methodology that expands knowledge gained in a wargame, by evaluating additional courses of action as well as the robustness of decisions made given variations in the operational environment.
