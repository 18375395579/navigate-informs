Title: Towards an Analytical Model to Assess Read-rate Probabilities in RFID Systems<br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Oklahoma State University, EN 322, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, satish.t.bukkapatnam@okstate.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a statistical model based on modified Friis free space equation to estimate read-rates of RFID systems in multiple environments. Experimental results show that the model capture the read rate probabilities and trends.
