Title: Fluctuation Analysis for the Loss from Default<br>Author: Justin Sirignano, Stanford Univerisity, Huang Engineering Center, Stanford, United States of America, jasirign@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Konstantinos Spiliopoulos, Kay Giesecke<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The loss from default in large credit portfolios is typically computationally expensive to evaluate.  We analyze the fluctuation of the loss from default around its large portfolio limit in a class of reduced-form models of correlated firm-by-firm default timing. We prove a weak convergence result for the fluctuation process and use it for developing a conditionally Gaussian approximation to the loss distribution.
