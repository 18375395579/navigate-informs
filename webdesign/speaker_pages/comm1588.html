<br>Title: An Ensemble Classification Algorithm with Clustered Features</br><br>Author: Chanhee Park, Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, chanhee.b@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we propose a new classification algorithm based upon a set of features clustered. The features were clustered by a standard clustering algorithm followed by the classification analysis in each clustered feature. We used the simulation and real data to demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed algorithm.</br>
