Title: An Ensemble Classification Algorithm with Clustered Features<br>Author: Chanhee Park, Korea University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, chanhee.b@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this study, we propose a new classification algorithm based upon a set of features clustered. The features were clustered by a standard clustering algorithm followed by the classification analysis in each clustered feature. We used the simulation and real data to demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed algorithm.
