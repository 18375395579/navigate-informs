Title: Testing Random Preference Models<br>Author: Michel Regenwetter, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 603, E. Daniel, Champaign, IL, United States of America, regenwet@uiuc.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Loomes and Sugden (EER, 1995) discussed a random preference model of transitivity and stated that it does not place enough restrictions on data. They endorsed testing weak stochastic transitivity. Actually, there are many random preference models for transitivity, and they are more parsimonious than weak stochastic transivity. I discuss laboratory tests of these models. We circumvent a range of conceptual, modelling and statistical problems that plague the literature.
