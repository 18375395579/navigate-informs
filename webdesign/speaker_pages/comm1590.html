<br>Title: Dynamic Valuation of Delinquent Credit-card Accounts</br><br>Author: Naveed Chehrazi, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, nchehrazi@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper introduces a dynamic model of consumers' repayment behavior on overdue (delinquent) credit-card loans placed in collections using a self-exciting point process. The models used to construct a probability measure for the collectability of a delinquent account. The resulting account-speci c dynamic collectability score (DCS) estimates, at any given time in the collections process, the probability of collecting a given percentage of the outstanding balance over a desired time horizon. The method is tested using a large set of account-level repayment data. The improvements in classi cation and prediction performance compared to standard bank-internal scoring methods are significant.</br>
