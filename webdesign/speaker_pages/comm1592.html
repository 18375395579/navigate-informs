<br>Title: Returns to Consumer Search and its Determinants</br><br>Author: Shweta Singh, Assistant Professor, Texas Woman's University, 304 Administration Drive, P.O. Box 425589, Denton, TX, 76204, United States of America, Shweta_utd@hotmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): B.P.S. Murthi, Brian Ratchford</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We provide a comprehensive approach to measuring returns to consumer search. We base our conceptual framework of returns to search on the household production model and define returns to search as the efficiency with which consumers are able to make optimal choices. We employ Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to create a measure of returns to search. Our findings indicate that Internet users and more experienced and informed consumers tend to make more efficient choices.</br>
