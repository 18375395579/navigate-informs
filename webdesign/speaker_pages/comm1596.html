Title: Improving WHO Guidelines: HIV Monitoring Strategies in Resource-Poor Settings<br>Author: Eran Bendavid, Stanford University, 117 Encina Commons, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, ebd@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Douglas Owens<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The response to the HIV epidemic in Africa is changing from crisis management to a strategic plan. Guidelines about treatment are changing to reflect HIV management as a chronic disease. Monitoring patients with CD4 and viral load counts remain the most important tools for treatment initiation, change, and discontinuation. We present a cost-effectiveness analysis of disease monitoring strategies in South Africa using a simulation model and discuss the implications of our findings.
