Title: DDDAS-based Simulation for the Distributed Manufacturing Enterprise<br>Author: Young-Jun Son, Associate Professor, The University of Arizona, Systems and Industrial Engineering, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, son@sie.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Parag Sarfare, Nurcin Koyuncu, Seungho Lee<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We intend to augment the validity of simulation models in the most economic way using automated fidelity switching in a multi-fidelity model via incorporating dynamic data into the executing model, which then steers the measurement process for selective data update.  Comprehensive architecture is first described, and four algorithms embedded within the real-time simulation model are then discussed.  Finally, a prototype system is demonstrated for a distributed manufacturing enterprise.
