<br>Title: A Machine-learning Technique for the Prediction of Equity Price Direction</br><br>Author: Michael Rechenthin, University of Iowa, Management Science, Iowa City, IA, United States of America, michael-rechenthin@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nick Street</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present machine learning techniques to anticipate future directional price moves in stocks in the very short term. Historical price data and technical analysis indicators are used to build thousands of classifiers that are then employed in dynamically-constructed ensembles across different stocks. These predictors update automatically to adjust for changing market conditions and can help traders better make more informed trading decisions.</br>
