<br>Title: Using Approximate Reasoning To Evaluate Terrorist Intent</br><br>Author: Stephen Eisenhawer, President, Logic Evolved Technologies, Inc., PO Box 1807, Santa Fe, NM, 87504-1861, United States, seisenhawer@logicevolved.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Terry Bott, Markus Binder, Gary Ackerman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The likelihood that a terrorist group mounts an attack is a function of intent and capability. An approximate reasoning-based (AR) model to evaluate intent is presented.  In AR inferences are made with rule bases and variables are linguistic. The model here is a rational choice (RC) representation of terrorist decision-making. We discuss RC in the AR context and present illustrative results. Revisions to include expressive factors such as ideological obsessions are examined.</br>
