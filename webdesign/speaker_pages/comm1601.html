Title: A Tactical Multi-week Implicit Tour Scheduling Model with Applications in Healthcare<br>Author: Mark Isken, Associate Professor of MIS, Oakland University, School of Business Administration, Rochester, MI, 48309, United States of America, isken@oakland.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Staff scheduling continues to be a vexing problem for healthcare institutions. Commonly used staff scheduling practices result in extremely large and complex scheduling problems. We present a multi-week implicit tour scheduling model that can accommodate a wide range of flexible scheduling practices. Both computational results using software from the COIN-OR project (Pyomo and CBC) as well as experience with using this model in actual hospital staffing projects will be presented.
