<br>Title: Prediction, Non-clinical Factors and Intervention in Unnecessary Hospital Readmissions</br><br>Author: Brandon Pope, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, popeb@purdue.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Unnecessary readmissions waste $17 B per year in U.S. hospitals on Medicare patients alone. In this presentation we focus on calibrating predictive models using nearly 400,000 discharges over a 3.5 year span from a network of 11 U.S. hospitals. We also examine the relative importance of non-clinical factors in readmission rates. Motivated by financial reform, we model the discharge intervention problem, highlighting the possibility of unintuitive optimal policies, and opportunities for research.</br>
