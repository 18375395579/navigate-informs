Title: Bayesian Multi-information Source Optimization with Expensive Function Evaluations<br>Author: Jialei Wang, Cornell University, Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, jw865@cornell.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a knowledge-gradient policy for noisy global optimization with multiple information sources.  The policy uses value of information calculations and Bayesian statistics to decide, at each point in time, both at which point in the design space to evaluate, and which information source to use in this evaluation.  We present an application to materials science, in which one information source is a computationally expensive simulator, and the other is a physical experiment.
