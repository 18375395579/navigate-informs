Title: Improved Detection of Out-of-Control Conditions in Multivariate Process Control<br>Author: Amit Mitra, Associate Dean, Auburn University, Office of Dean, College of Business, Auburn, AL, 368495240, United States, mitra@business.auburn.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Process monitoring involving multiple variables using control charts has traditionally used a distance measure in the form of a T-squared chart. The measure has usually been based on process output variables. In this paper, we consider two categories of input variables that may impact the output variables; process regulatory variables and the uncontrollable noise factors.
