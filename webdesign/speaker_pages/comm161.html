Title: Integrating Road Building Decisions in Harvest Scheduling Models<br>Author: Victor Valdebenito, School of Forest Resources, The Pennsylvania State University, 236 Forest Resources Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, vav112@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marc McDill<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We incorporated road building decisions in a mixed integer harvest schedule model, where two different potential road network structures were used as model inputs. In one case, the potential road network is allowed to have cycles, while in the other case the potential road network follows a simpler dendridic structure.  For each of these scenarios, different formulations were evaluated, considering the tradeoff produced in quality of solution and computational effort required.
