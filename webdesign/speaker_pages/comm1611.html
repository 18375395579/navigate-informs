In the usual situation where runs of the simulation take a non-negligible amount of time and computing, experimental design is extremely important in gaining high quality information from simulations. Principles of experimental design will be proposed and justified which ensure high numeric accuracy, high nominal accuracy, and accurate parameter estimates for deterministic simulations.</br>
