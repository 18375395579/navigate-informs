Title: Control under Model Uncertainty in the Halfin-Whitt Regime<br>Author: Rami Atar, Assoc. Professor, Technion, Department of Electrical Engineering, Haifa, 32000, Israel, atar@ee.technion.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Adam Shwartz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: I will present diffusion limit theorems for many-server queueing models under three forms of uncertainty: Models where parameters are random; models where information on service time distribution is given only through samples from the distribution; and models where service rates  are completely unknown.
