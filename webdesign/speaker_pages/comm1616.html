In this study, a new graphical representation based on the cumulative amount of amino and keto bases, called UnitX method is proposed. Classification tree is then employed to verify the distinguish ability of the projected sequences. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can efficiently distinguish the four serotypes of Dengue virus sequences.</br>
