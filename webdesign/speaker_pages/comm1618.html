This model takes into consideration the cost benefits and risks associated with locating biorefineries near intermodal hubs, such as, inland ports, sea ports and rail ramps. We developed an accelerated Benders decomposition approach to solve large instances of this problem. We validate the model on a case study using data from the southeast region of USA.</br>
