Title: Modeling and Forecasting Mortality Rates<br>Author: Daniel Mitchell, University of Texas, McCombs School of Business, 1 University Station, B6000, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Daniel.Mitchell@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Brockett, Rafael Mendoza, Kumar Muthuraman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a model that expresses log mortality rate changes as an age group dependent linear transformation of a mortality index. The mortality index is modeled as a Normal Inverse Gaussian. We demonstrate, with an exhaustive set of experiments and data sets spanning 11 countries over 100 years, that the proposed model significantly out performs existing models.
