Title: Simulation Study of a Three-level CPFR System<br>Author: James Bookbinder, Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. West, CPH 4323, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, jbookbinder@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Amanda Cha<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Sales data on several product groups of a well known manufacturer are employed. That firm participates in Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment with a major retail chain. Through a stochastic simulation model, we contrast CPFR to Vendor Managed Inventory, and to Independent Sourcing. Comparisons are made on total system cost, aggregate inventory levels, and fill rates.
