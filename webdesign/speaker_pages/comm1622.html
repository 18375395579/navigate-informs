Title: Model and Solution Algorithm for Schedule-based Transit Assignment<br>Author: Alireza Khani, University of Arizona, 1209 E.

The model uses logit route choice and takes into account transit vehicles capacity to model user behavior more realistically. A simulation-based assignment algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently and application in a large network is provided.
