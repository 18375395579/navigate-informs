Second Street, Room 206A-1, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, akhani@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hickman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: An optimization model is proposed for passenger assignment in schedule-based transit networks. The model uses logit route choice and takes into account transit vehicles capacity to model user behavior more realistically. A simulation-based assignment algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently and application in a large network is provided.</br>
