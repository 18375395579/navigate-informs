<br>Title: Support Vector Machines Based on Tail Risk Measures in Financial Applications</br><br>Author: Peter Tsyurmasto, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, tsyurmasto@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stan Uryasev</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We considered several well-known Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and proposed a new  SVM  based on Value-at-Risk (VaR).  Computational experiments with several Financial applications showed that the SVM based on VaR  is not sensitive to large outliers.</br>
