<br>Title: How to Implement Random Forests, in Clojure, in a Weekend</br><br>Author: John McDonald, Amazon.com, johnmcd@amazon.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Random forest regression and classification are used widely, and successfully, by many teams at Amazon, playing a significant role in the bottom line. It is worth some effort therefore to understand exactly how they work. Fortunately, random forests are, arguably, the simplest useful machine learning algorithm --- so simple that a working implementation can be easily be produced in a day or 2.  In this talk, I'll walk you thru the highlights of 'A random forest regression kit', which is a detailed guide to producing your own random forests implementation in Clojure (a dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM), in a weekend. Even if you make no future use of the resulting code, the exercise should be worth the effort, because it will give you the solid understanding you need when choosing between random forests and alternatives, or between implementations of random forests itself.</br>
