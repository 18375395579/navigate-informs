<br>Title: The Cost-effectiveness of Herpes Zoster Vaccine</br><br>Author: Mehdi Najafzadeh, PhD Student, University of British Columbia, 2545 West Broadway, Vancouver, BC, V6K 2E9, Canada, mehdin@interchange.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eleni Galanis, David Patrick, Carlo Marra</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The incidence and severity of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia increase with age in association with a progressive decline in cell-mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV).  Vaccination against VZV decreases the incidence and severity of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia among older adults. We used a discrete event simulation model to determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating against VZV in older adults in British Columba.</br>
