<br>Title: Parsimony vs RFID</br><br>Author: Metin Cakanyildirim, University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management SM 30, Richardson, TX, United States of America, metin@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alain Bensoussan, Suresh Sethi, Celine Ho</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: One of the potential benefits of RFID tags is reducing inventory costs by using information-rich models.  The benefit is the difference between the costs of an information-rich model and the cost of a parsimonious model.  We illustrate numerical/approximation techniques to compute the costs.</br>
