The traditional provisioning solutions employing classical demand estimation approaches can hardly guarantee convergence to the optimal offering. In our study, we present a non-parametric adaptive learning approach that provides much improved offering solutions. This learning approach could be used to calibrate the model and converge to the optimal.</br>
