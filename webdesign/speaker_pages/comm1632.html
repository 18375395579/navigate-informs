The improvement project featured a videotaping of the  service process in the UPMC Eye Center’s imaging room for an extended period. Based  on analyzing the videos, the researchers at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School  of Business, together with the physicians at UPMC Eye Center, proposed a simple  “dome-shaped?strategy that used different appointment interval before, during, and  after the lunchtime, and determined the optimal service parameters using queueing  network modeling and simulation analysis. Students learn through this case how to  address a real-life service design problem through detailed observation, quantitative  modeling, and simulation. They are also taught how to make recommendations  matching the needs and the expectations of real service environments. This case is  intended for both undergraduate and MBA students in operations management, service  management, or healthcare analysis courses, as well as health professionals who are  interested in improving the efficiencies in their workplaces.</br>
