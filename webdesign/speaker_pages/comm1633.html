<br>Title: Fair Workload Allocation Problems using Simulation Optimization</br><br>Author: Soo Ho Lee, The Ohio State University, 2100 Neil Ave., Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, lee.2590@buckeyemail.osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Theodore Allen, Melissa Pizarro</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Allocating limited resources across parallel subsystems is relevant to voting machine allocation and health care resource provisioning. With large numbers of subsystems, efficient discrete event simulation evaluations are computationally difficult but could, conceivably, aid in accurate evaluation of performance. We examine and describe the basic framework for these results which permits rigorous, accurate, and fair allocation focusing on voting machine allocation applications.</br>
