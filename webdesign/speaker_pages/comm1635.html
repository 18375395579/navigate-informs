Title: A Partial Plus General Equilibrium Approach to the Simulation of the Impact of EU ETS<br>Author: Pedro Linares, Universidad Pontificia Comillas, Alberto Aguilera 23, Madrid, 28015, Spain, pedro.linares@upcomillas.es<br>Coauthor(s): Xavier Labandeira, Miguel Rodríguez<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: There are mainly two different approaches to analyze the effects of carbon emissions trading on the economy: partial equilibrium analysis and general equilibrium analysis. However, the use of both approaches separately may result in biased conclusions. The objective of this research is to simulate the effects of the European carbon market in Spain with a new approach integrating a partial equilibrium model for the electricity sector and a general equilibrium model for the whole economy.
