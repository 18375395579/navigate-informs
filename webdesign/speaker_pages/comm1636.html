<br>Title: American Option Pricing for Subordinate Diffusions</br><br>Author: Lingfei Li, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong - PRC, lingfeili2012@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Linetsky</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop an eigenfunction expansion approach for pricing American options under models based on subordinate diffusions (i.e. jump-diffusions or pure jump processes obtained by time changing diffusions with Levy subordinators). As an application we consider American option pricing under the SubOU-based commodity model with mean-reverting jumps.</br>
