<br>Title: Robust Models for Range Estimate from Noisy Biosensors</br><br>Author: Sanjay Mehrotra, Northwestern University, IEMS Department, MEAS, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, mehrotra@iems.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Van Duyne, Olga Lyandres, Matthew Glucksberg, Joseph Walsh</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Development of reliable bio-sensors hinges on the accuracy of their calibration and preredictions.  For example, when comparing predictions for a set of glucose measurements based on surface-enhanced Raman spectra least-square and partial-least-square models have been used.  We develop new robsut models for estimating glucose concentrations from sensor measurements with two important features: namely, generating an estimate range, and incorporating data uncertainty.</br>
