The quantile of the failure distribution at usage level can be easily estimated. Compared with traditional parametric regression methods, quantile regression is distribution free, efficient in presence of censoring, and is more flexible in modeling ALT relations. In addition, the method can be used naturally in the cases when the failure-free life depends on the accelerating factor.</br>
