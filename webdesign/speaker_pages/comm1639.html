Title: Effects of Community Structure on Respondent-Driven Sampling<br>Author: Sharad Goel, Yahoo!

The sample is collected through a form of snowball sampling where current sample members recruit future sample members. We present RDS as Markov chain Monte Carlo importance sampling, and examine the effects of community structure and recruitment methodology on the estimates. Our results are based on data collected as part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.
