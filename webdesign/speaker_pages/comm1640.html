<br>Title: DaimlerChrysler / J.D. Power: Pioneering Scientific Price Customization in the Automobile Industry</br><br>Author: Jorge Silva-Risso, Assistant Professor, University of California, Riverside, 201 Anderson Hall, Riverside, CA, 92521, United States, jorge.silva-risso@ucr.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexei Khavaev, William Shearin, Irina Ionova, Deirdre Borrego</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a model developed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of automakers pricing and promotions decisions (about $45 billion each year in the US). The approach is based on a random effects multinomial nested logit model of product, acquisition (purchase, lease) and program-type (rebates, reduced APR, etc.) choice.  A hierarchical Bayes structure is used to capture response heterogeneity at the local market level.  Chrysler estimates annual savings to be about $500 million.</br>
