<br>Title: Video Distribution on the Internet: Peer-to-peer vs. Client-server</br><br>Author: Ramesh Johari, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Center, Room 319, Stanford, CA, United States, ramesh.johari@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Shakkottai</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We use a fluid model to compare the peer-to-peer model for video distribution with a more traditional client-server approach.  We analyze the relative performance of the two schemes, both from the point of view of consumers, as well as the content provider; under a word-of-mouth demand model, we show that peer-to-peer file transmission generally performs better.  We also study the implications for pricing and capacity management.</br>
