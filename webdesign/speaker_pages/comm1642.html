Title: Analysis of Nonlinear and Nonstationary Time series in Complex Systems: A Comparative Study<br>Author: Changqing Cheng, Research Assistant, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, changqing.cheng@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Effective prediction of the future states remains a challenge as complex systems exhibit combined nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics. Structure of the nonlinear dynamic relationship among the measured signals and states remains unknown if not indeterminable in most cases. This study provides a review for the advanced models for nonlinear and nonstationary time series prediction, and summarized the models developed at our research group.
