Darling, Applied Research Mathematician, National Security Agency, P. O. Box 535, Annapolis Junction, MD, 20701, United States, rwdarli@nsa.gov</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The coding theory examples presented in Bruce Hajek's Markov Lecture will be used to illuminate the possibilities for building a parsimonious and accurate differential equations model, in cases where a simple combinatorial algorithm is applied to a large (usually sparse) data set. Suitable references and study materials will be suggested for those wishing to try fluid limits.</br>
