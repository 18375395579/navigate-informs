However, as data become easier to store, historical out of control (OC) data are provided and can be exploited as well, especially for processes with less prior information. We propose a general framework to monitor complex processes in which historical OC data are fully utilized and some data mining tools are employed. A simple diagnostic framework could be applied when the control chart signals.</br>
