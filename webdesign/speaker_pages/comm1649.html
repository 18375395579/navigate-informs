Title: Uncertainty in Chemotherapy Patient Scheduling<br>Author: Sara Shashaani, ISE PhD Student, Virginia Technical University, Blacksburg, VA, United States of America, sshashaa@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Lawley, Ayten Turkcan, Hong Wan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Chemotherapy patient scheduling is a complex problem due to varying treatment lengths and nursing requirements, unpredictable same-day cancellations and unscheduled add-ons. Sensitivity analysis of uncertainties in the workflow is studied using a discrete-event simulation model to distinguish the stochastic elements that impose significant changes in the performance of the system when they encompass variability. Changes to the current deterministic scheduling model are proposed for flexibility.
