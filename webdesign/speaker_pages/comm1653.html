<br>Title: Forecasting Demand in the Presence of Promotions, Which Tool to Use When</br><br>Author: Ozden Gur Ali, Koc University, Sariyer, Istanbul, Turkey, oali@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aysegul Tuncelli, Serpil Say&#305;n</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Forecasting demand in the presence of promotions is a critical but difficult task. Our objective is to evaluate the performance of different data mining strategies, including the type of tool (regression, regression trees, and SVR), the data content (length of history, and competitor information) and the model content (SKU by SKU, and all SKUs collectively) for different types of SKUs. We generate the data using a simulation based on a consumer choice model from the marketing literature, with calibrated parameters; and conclude useful strategies for different situations.</br>
