Title: Bayesian Variable Selection for Computer Experiments<br>Author: Ying Hung, Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics,  Rutgers University, 110 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, yhung@stat.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xinwei Deng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Identifying inputs that significantly impact a complex system is a critical step in computer experiments. Such active factors can be further used to improve model accuracy. In this work, we propose a new and unified Bayesian framework to identify active factors. This framework is based on a widely used Gaussian process model and a novel approximation to simplify the computation. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via simulations and real examples.
