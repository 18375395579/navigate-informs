Such active factors can be further used to improve model accuracy. In this work, we propose a new and unified Bayesian framework to identify active factors. This framework is based on a widely used Gaussian process model and a novel approximation to simplify the computation. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via simulations and real examples.</br>
