Title: Game Theoretic Approach to Air Combat Simulation<br>Author: Kai Virtanen, Teaching Research Scientist, Systems Analysis Laboratory, Otakaari 1M, 02150 Espoo, Espoo, Finland<br>Coauthor(s): Jirka Poropudas<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a game theoretic approach to the validation of a discrete event air combat simulation model and the analysis of simulation data. Statistical techniques are applied for estimating games from simulation data. The validity of the simulation model is assessed by comparing the properties of the games to practices in air combat. The games are also applied for analyzing the effectiveness of air combat tactics and technologies.
