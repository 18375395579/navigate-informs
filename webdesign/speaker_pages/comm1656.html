Title: Expanding an Expected Goals Model for Evaulating NHL Teams and Players<br>Author: Nicholas Clark, Instructor, Math Department USMA, Thayer Hall, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, nicholas.clark@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Derek Burt, Brian Macdonald, Michael Findlay<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: One difficulty with analyzing performance in hockey is the relatively low scoring rate.  In this paper, we predict goals using non-traditional regression techniques. Our models outperform other models used in the sport with regard to L2 norm between actual goals vs predicted goals. We estimate a player’s contribution to his team’s expected goals per 60 minutes.  The results for expected goals provide an additional means by which NHL analysts can measure how valuable a player is to his team.
