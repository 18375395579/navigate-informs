Title: Virtual Call Centers<br>Author: Serguei Netessine, Professor, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, France, serguei.netessine@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Konstantinos Stauras, Karan Girotra<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the high-performance virtual call center business model (cf.  LiveOps). Incoming calls are directed in real-time to work-from-home agents. Agents are ranked based on performance--higher ranked agents get more calls and agents are paid only for the time on the call. We model the system as an M/M/N system with ranked servers and study the role of different ranking schemes. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that less meritocratic schemes outperform more meritocratic schemes.
