LiveOps). Incoming calls are directed in real-time to work-from-home agents. Agents are ranked based on performance--higher ranked agents get more calls and agents are paid only for the time on the call. We model the system as an M/M/N system with ranked servers and study the role of different ranking schemes. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that less meritocratic schemes outperform more meritocratic schemes.</br>
