<br>Title: X-Bar and R Control Charts for Long-tailed Symmetrical Distributions</br><br>Author: Pandu Tadikamalla, Professor, University of Pittsburgh, KGSB-Business Admin, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States, pandu@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mihai Banciu, Dana Popescu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes a kurtosis correction (KC) method for constructing the X-bar and R control charts for symmetrical long-tailed distributions. These charts are similar to the traditional Shewhart control charts, and are derived based on the degree of kurtosis estimated from the actual (subgroup) data. In a subsequent paper, we also propose a range quantile approximation (RQA) method for the R charts, and provide the tables for the R chart constants for the leptokurtic and normal distributions.</br>
