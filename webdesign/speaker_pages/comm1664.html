<br>Title: Social Network Analysis for Data Mining</br><br>Author: Wei Wang, Stevens Institue of Tech., Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, United States of America, wwang3@stevens.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hong Man</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Social network analysis provides a mathematical framework for analyzing human and economy relationships, as well as information propagation in networks. In this paper, we explore how the social network as a tool to deploy data mining on digging suspicious activities of mobile nodes in ad hoc networks based on social relationship rules. Comparable metrics from traditional data mining algorithms can also be presented by social networks, such as the famous rule based mining schemes.</br>
