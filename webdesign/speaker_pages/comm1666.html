Title: Large-Scale Dispensing for Emergency Response to Bioterrorisim and Infectious Disease Outbreak<br>Author: Eva Lee, Associate Professor, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Siddhartha Maheshwary<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A simulation and decision support system, RealOpt, for planning large-scale emergency dispensing clinics to respond to biological threats and infectious disease outbreaks is described. RealOpt incorporates efficient optimization seamlessly interfaced with a simulation module. It allows public health administrators to investigate clinic design and staffing scenarios quickly for operational and strategic planning. Experience of using RealOpt for actual Anthrax drill planning will be analyzed.
