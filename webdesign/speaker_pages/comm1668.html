The models, developed by languages Arena and Automod, cover detailed movements of passengers and baggage.  Working with architects and planners, we show that simulation can become part of the design process by evaluating multiple design options quickly. We will also share the challenges we faced and lessons learned in implementing simulation modeling.</br>
