<br>Title: A Two-stage Model of Consideration Set and Choice</br><br>Author: Srikanth Jagabathula, Professor, NYU Stern School of Business, 44 West Fourth Street, KMC Suite 8-74, new york, NY, 10012, United States of America, sjagabat@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paat Rusmevichientong</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A main challenge in demand modeling is to strike a balance between flexibility (ability to extrapolate) and performance (prediction accuracy) while keeping the model computationally tractable. We strike this balance through a new two-stage demand model: customers first pick a consideration set (a smaller subset of relevant products) and then choose the most preferred product from the consideration set. We propose techniques to estimate these models from purchase transaction data.</br>
