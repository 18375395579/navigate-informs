Title: Detailed Scheduling in ILOG CP Optimizer<br>Author: Paul Shaw, Constraint Programming R&D, ILOG, 9 rue de Verdun, Gentilly, France, pshaw@ilog.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Philippe Laborie, Jerome Rogerie, Petr Vilim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This talk describes the detailed scheduling support in ILOG CP Optimizer.  The modeling framework uses interval variables, precedence constraints,  sequences and functions to model a wide variety of problems.  Automatic search uses various techniques including:  the computation of partial order schedules,  linear temporal relaxation to guide re-optimization,  and machine learning to speed up convergence.  The robustness of the approach is illustrated on a large panel of  scheduling problems.
