Title: Simulating from Analytic Characteristic Functions<br>Author: Liming Feng, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, fenglm@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zisheng Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Analytic characteristic functions naturally arise in financial engineering applications. We explore the analyticity of such characteristic functions and propose simple but accurate inversion schemes. They admit explicit error estimates that allow us to derive explicit bounds for the estimation bias when the inverse transform method is used to simulate from such analytic characteristic functions.
