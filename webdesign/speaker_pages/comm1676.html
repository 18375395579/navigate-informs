We propose a new dynamic model, the conditional survival (CS) model, which provided excellent calibration to both iTraxx tranches and underlying single name CDS on March 14, 2008, the day before the collapse of Bear Sterns. The CS model can generate strong cross-sectional correlation and allows fast pricing and calculation of sensitivity of CDO tranches to underlying single name CDS.</br>
