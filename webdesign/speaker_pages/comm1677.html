<br>Title: Real-time Traffic Anomaly Detection for IT Incident Management</br><br>Author: Feng Li, Dr., IBM Research - China, Diamond Building, Beijing, China, lfeng@cn.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Emily Liu, Lijun Mei, Jery Li, Juhnyoung Lee, Qi Cheng Li</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Real-time traffic anomaly detection plays a key role in IT Incident Management as heavy workload and traffic on servers and networks is one of primary causes IT incident in enterprise computing environment. It can provide alert messages to users for preventive actions. In this study, a real time traffic anomaly detection solution is presented. It firstly determines patterns for traffic metrics; then describes traffic metrics by using an ARIMA model; and finally identifies any traffic anomaly.</br>
