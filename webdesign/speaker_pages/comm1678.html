Title: Engineering Improvements in Efficiency, Patient Flow and Care in a Hospital Surgical Suite<br>Author: David Moore, Ph.D, KLICNET.ORG, The Knowledge, Learning and Intellectual Capital Network, 3788 Davidson Place, Boulder, CO, 80305, United States, dmoore@klicnet.org<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This hospital case study follows process improvements from conception through implementation, identifies engineering and analytical techniques leveraged and describes obstacles faced and successful change management tactics applied.  The ongoing improvement effort combines interviews, archival data and hundreds of hours of direct observation with process mapping, statistical and Pareto analysis, simulation, optimization and heuristics to improve metrics of efficiency, patient flow, and care.
