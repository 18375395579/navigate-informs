Title: Enhancing Vehicle Trajectory Estimation using Airborne Image Data<br>Author: Zhuoyang Zhou, Arizona State University, 699 S Mill Ave, BYENG MailRoom 523, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, zhuoyang.zhou@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pitu Mirchandani<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The problem that we are addressing is follows:  Given macro data (speeds, densities and volumes) on a freeway segment, given some precise data from airborne data, can we reconstruct trajectories of vehicles on the segment.  We use the cell transmission model to first develop approximate trajectories which are refined using the image data and a least square estimation model.
