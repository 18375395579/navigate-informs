Title: Modeling Secrecy and Deception in a Multiple-period Attacker-defender Signaling Game<br>Author: Jun Zhuang, Assistant Professor, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, jzhuang@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vicki Bier, Oguzhan Alagoz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this work, we apply game theory to model strategies of secrecy and deception in a multiple-period, attacker-defender, resource-allocation and signaling game with incomplete information. Our model provides insights into the balance between capital and expense for defensive investments, and shows how defenders can achieve more cost-effective security through secrecy and deception in a multiple-period game. We solve our model using numerical dynamic programming methods.
