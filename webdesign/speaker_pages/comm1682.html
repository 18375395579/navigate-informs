Title: Stability of Load-balancing Policies in Stochastic Networks<br>Author: John Hasenbein, University of Texas, Austin, TX, United States of America, jhas@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jim Dai, Bara Kim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the stability of load-balancing policies based on join-the-shortest queue principles. In our model, jobs may revisit stations, thus the networks we study are more general structurally than so-called supermarket models. Using fluid model techniques we prove two conjectures appearing in Suhov and Vvedenskaya (2002). As part of the proof, we develop an augemented fluid model which  is able to resolve the stability characterization on the boundary of the stability region.
