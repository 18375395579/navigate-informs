An adaptive adversary model aims to model the behavior of the adversary in response to defender actions. Is this a predictive exercise? Should it be? This talk examines adaptive adversary modeling from a predictive modeling perspective, providing an assessment of whether or not is desirable, and if so, feasible, for adaptive adversary models to be predictive models.</br>
