Title: Adaptive Adversary Modeling - A Predictive Modeling Perspective<br>Author: Seth Guikema, Assistant Professor, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States of America, sguikem1@jhu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Adaptive adversary modeling is an integral part of intelligent adversary risk analysis. An adaptive adversary model aims to model the behavior of the adversary in response to defender actions. Is this a predictive exercise? Should it be? This talk examines adaptive adversary modeling from a predictive modeling perspective, providing an assessment of whether or not is desirable, and if so, feasible, for adaptive adversary models to be predictive models.
