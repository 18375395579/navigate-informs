<br>Title: Non-linear Experimental Design Considerations for Reliability Testing with Censoring</br><br>Author: Eric Monroe, Statistician, Intel Corporation, 5000 W. Chandler Blvd, Mailstop CH2-117, Chandler, AZ, 85226-3699, United States, eric.m.monroe@intel.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Use Condition assessments for reliability typically require fitting an empirical model based on accelerated testing and extrapolating results to a less severe environmental condition.  This presentation explores the importance of experimental design selection in fitting non-linear response surfaces for reliability testing with heavy censoring.  Sensitivity analysis for sample size and interval sampling will be examined though a numerical study and compared to alphabetic optimization techniques.</br>
