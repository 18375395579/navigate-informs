Title: Computer Experiment for Data Center Thermal Management<br>Author: Zhiguang Qian, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin at Madison, zhiguang@stat.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yasuo Amemiya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Data centers  are integrated IT systems consisting of  multiple servers. Thermal modelling is a key in running and designing this type of system. Computational fluid dynamics techniques are widely used for simulating data center thermal properties under different configurations. Incorporating physical properties and structural analysis, we present some efficient multivariate analysis methods for  modelling the  multivariate responses from this experiment.
