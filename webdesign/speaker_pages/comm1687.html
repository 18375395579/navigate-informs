<br>Title: Efficient Estimation of Portfolio Credit Risk Without Monte Carlo Simulation</br><br>Author: Andrew Barnes, Researcher, Quantitative Methods, General Electric Global Research, 1 Research Circle, Room K14A58, Niskayuna, NY, 12309, United States of America, barnesa@research.ge.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Monte Carlo simulation has become a de facto standard for a large variety of financial simulations. We show that the problem of computing the credit risk loss distribution of a portfolio of loans is amenable to a more efficient probabalistic treatment than that offered by Monte Carlo simulation. Besides reducing computation time, this approach has the following advantages:  (1) It clarifies the structure of complex portfolio credit risk models by focusing attention on the most significant drivers,  while ignoring effects that merely contribute to noise.  (2) There is a considerable reduction in run time compared to Monte Carlo simulation. This time gain can be harnessed to answer a variety of questions that are too time consuming via Monte Carlo.</br>
