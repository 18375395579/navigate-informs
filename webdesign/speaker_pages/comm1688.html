<br>Title: Process Variance Monitoring and Diagnosis through Spatial Pattern Projection</br><br>Author: Jian Liu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, jliuzz@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Monitoring and diagnosis of process variance based on multivariate quality measurement data is challenging.  Existing approaches are mainly applied in univariate processes and provide limited diagnosis capability.   This research proposes a method to project multivariate data to a set of pre-estimated spatial patterns that correspond to potential variation sources.</br>
