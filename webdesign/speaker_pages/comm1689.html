<br>Title: Medium-Term Planning and Scheduling Under Uncertainty for BP Chemicals</br><br>Author: Andrew Schaefer, Assistant Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Department Industrial Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, schaefer@ie.pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mehmet Demirci, Gorkem Saka, Anastasia Vaia, Norman F Jerome</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We extend BP Chemicals?medium-term operations planning model which represents global production assets, distribution system for some of their chemical businesses and uses forecasts of the future economic environment. Our goal is to develop a multi-stage stochastic integer program through extending their model so it will explicitly account for the uncertainty in forecasts. We present a 2-stage stochastic LP where the operating policy for first month constitutes the first-stage decision variables</br>
