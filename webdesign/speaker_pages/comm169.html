<br>Title: A Methodology to Derive the Critical Demand Density for Designing and Operating Feeder Transit Services</br><br>Author: Xiugang Li, Zachry Department of Civil Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, li_xiugang@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Luca Quadrifoglio</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the impact on productivity of specific operating practices currently used by PAratransit providers.  We investigate the effect of using a zoning vs. a no zoning strategy and time window settings on performance measures such as total trip miles, deadhead miles and fleet size. We conduct this study through a simulation model of the operations for a provider in Los Angeles County.</br>
