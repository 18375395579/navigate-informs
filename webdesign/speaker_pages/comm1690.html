Title: An Oligopolistic Cellulosic Biofuel Market Model<br>Author: Yongxi Huang, Clemson University, 314 Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, yxhuang@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yihsu Chen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We nested an oligopolistic market model formulated as a complementarity problem in a mixed-integer planning model to assess emerging cellulosic biofuel market. The blenders are allowed to exercise market power when other entities in the market behave competitively. The model was implemented in an illustrative case study of California. We report preliminary results in this talk.
