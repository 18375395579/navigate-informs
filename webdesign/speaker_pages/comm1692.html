<br>Title: Partially Flexible Operating Rooms</br><br>Author: Yann Ferrand, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, Department of Management, Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, yferran@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Magazine, Uday Rao</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: When organizing the operating theatre and scheduling surgeries, hospitals face a trade-off between the need to be responsive to emergency cases and to conduct scheduled elective surgeries efficiently. We develop a simulation model to compare resource-allocation policies of complete flexibility, and of complete focus, and compare them to hybrid partial flexibility policies. We evaluate these policies on patient and provider outcome measures, including patient wait time and physician overtime.</br>
