Title: A Network Flow Approach for Design Improvements in Interdependent Civil Infrastructures<br>Author: Guisselle Garcia Llinas, Student / Professor, University at Buffalo / Universidad del Norte, 438 Bell Hall / Km 5 Via a Puerto Colomb, Buffalo / Barranquilla, NY, 14260, United States of America, gagarcia@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Moises Sudit, Rakesh Nagi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Network flows have been traditionally used to redesign individual infrastructures.   We formulate an integrated layered network model to represent the interdependencies among multiple infrastructures and evaluate design choices (increasing capacity or a new link). The objective is to reduce the vulnerability of the overall system to natural and man-made disasters while respecting budget constraints over a planning horizon. Numerical studies will be presented.
