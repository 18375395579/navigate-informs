A quantitative assessment framework of resilience, measured by system performance impact and recovery effort, has been integrated into the stochastic modeling framework for disruption risk. A case study of biofuel infrastructure system planning in California shows that with this resilience design the system becomes more resilience and cost effective under seismic risk.</br>
