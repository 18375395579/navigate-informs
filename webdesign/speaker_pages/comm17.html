Title: Resilience in Managing Biofuel Infrastructure Systems under Seismic Hazards<br>Author: Yongxi Huang, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, 314 Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, yxhuang@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Weichiang Pang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study presents an approach that has explicitly considered the effects of seismic hazards in biofuel supply chain design. A quantitative assessment framework of resilience, measured by system performance impact and recovery effort, has been integrated into the stochastic modeling framework for disruption risk. A case study of biofuel infrastructure system planning in California shows that with this resilience design the system becomes more resilience and cost effective under seismic risk.
