Title: Stochastic Dynamics of Capacitated Flow Matching Networks Exposed to Random Disruptions<br>Author: Alex Savachkin, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, Dep. of IMSE, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, savachki@eng.usf.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Large and distributed infrastructures operate in an increasingly risk encumbered environment. The most profound influence on risk is capacity loss through man-made disasters, natural cataclysms, and property-related hazards. Modest events have the potential to propagate into cascading capacity disruptions with dramatic economic loss. We will present a modeling paradigm that captures the dynamics of capacity disruptions in feed-forward, flow matching networks. We will show how these stochastic models can be used to develop new methodologies to model network risk.
