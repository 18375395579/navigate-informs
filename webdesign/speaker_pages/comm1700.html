<br>Title: Degradation Modeling and Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Li-Ion Batteries</br><br>Author: Nan Chen, Assistant Professor, National University of Singapore, 1 Engineering Drive 2, Singapore, 129789, Singapore, isecn@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The increasing demands on green energy source have significantly pushed the application and development of Li-Ion batteries forward. To accomondate their wide applications, it is also necessary to accurately model their degradation and predict their remaining useful lives (RUL). In this article, we proposed a varying coefficient model to indirectly characterize the battery capacity degradation from its discharging profiles.</br>
