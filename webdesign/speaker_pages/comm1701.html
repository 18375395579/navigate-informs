Title: CVXMOD: Convex Optimization in Python<br>Author: Jacob Mattingley, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, Dept of Electrical Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, jacobm@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Boyd<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: CVXMOD is a Python tool for modeling convex optimization problems. The first development goals were to make a completely free toolchain for convex optimization, to use a modern programming language, and to use a fully object-oriented approach. CVXMOD fulfills these, currently working with CVXOPT's solvers. Later work has included automatic C code generation for convex problems. We will give an overview of the current state of CVXMOD and examples of its use, and discuss future directions.
