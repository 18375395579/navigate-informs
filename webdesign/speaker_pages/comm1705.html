Title: A Kernel Density Estimation Approach to Optimization of Public Access Defibrillator Locations<br>Author: Derya Demirtas, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Rd, Toronto, On, M5S 3G8, Canada, demirtas@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Chan, Roy Kwon<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Sudden cardiac arrest is a major public health issue. Deploying automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public areas for bystander use reduces the time to defibrillation and improves survival rates. In this talk, we present a kernel density estimation approach to estimate the spatial probability distribution of cardiac arrests. We then use this distribution to generate demand points to optimize and evaluate the models that we developed to guide the deployment of AEDs in public settings.
