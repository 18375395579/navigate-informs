Often changes in circulatory status occur rapidly, requiring continuous monitoring. This study is focused on how to extend the usability of hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, using a data mining approach with available clinical metrics to produce individual predictive hemodynamic models.</br>
