Title: Data Mining Approach using Hemodynamic Parameters<br>Author: Monica Puertas, University of South Florida, 18125 Birdwater Dr., Tampa, FL, 33647, United States of America, mpuertas@mail.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Fabri, Jose Luis Zayas-Castro<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The accurate assessment of the circulatory system is important for critically ill patients. Often changes in circulatory status occur rapidly, requiring continuous monitoring. This study is focused on how to extend the usability of hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, using a data mining approach with available clinical metrics to produce individual predictive hemodynamic models.
