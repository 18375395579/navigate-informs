Title: Strategic Diagnosis and Pricing in Expert Services<br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Consumers often cannot identify solutions to problems on their own (for e.g. car repair), and rely on experts who also provide the service, for the diagnosis. The information asymmetry arising upon diagnosis leads to inefficiencies in service provision. The expert has an incentive to over-provide or to ration services, based on the demand, capacity and the consumer waiting costs. We investigate diagnosis and pricing decisions in expert service markets using a queuing framework.
