Title: A Choice Model based on Preferences<br>Author: Varun Gupta, University of Texas-Dallas, Richardson, TX, United States of America, varun.gupta@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Metin Cakanyildirim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Willingness to pay (WTP) of customers for a product plays an anchoring role in determining pricing policies of a firm. We propose a WTP-based choice model, which also explicitly models preferences of a customer. Using real-life data, we compare the performance of the proposed model with the multi-choice logit model.
