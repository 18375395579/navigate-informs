Title: Stochastic Processes to Model Hospital Arrivals due to an Epidemic<br>Author: Esma Gel, Arizona State University, School of Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, Esma.Gel@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Maria Rieders, Baykal Hafizoglu, Lerzan Ormeci<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models are commonly used to analyze the spread of epidemic, pandemic and infectious diseases. In this paper, we shed some light on the arrival process of patients at a hospital due to an epidemic. We modify a Markovian SIR model by assuming that infected patients seek help at a hospital at an exponential rate. We present a recursive formulation for the calculation of the Laplace transforms for the interarrival times for the sequence of patients seeking help.
