Title: Lossed in Translation: Adjusted Scoring Rules to Recover Subjective Beliefs from Loss-Averse Experts<br>Author: Asa Palley, The Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Box 90120, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, abp12@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Theo Offerman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We apply a prospect theory model of risk preferences to examine the incentives of an expert under an asymmetric quadratic scoring rule. We use these results to develop the L-adjusted scoring rule, a modified quadratic rule that corrects these distortions and allows for the recovery of an accurate estimate of probabilistic beliefs. Finally, we conduct an experiment that demonstrates the effectiveness of this modification in eliciting truthful beliefs and eliminating conservative baseline reports.
