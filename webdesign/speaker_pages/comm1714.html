We argue that the natural solution concept to evaluate these tradeoffs is the lowest SNE by generalizing the connection between the lowest SNE and the VCG outcome. We then propose a new ranking algorithm that uses a reserve price to order the ads (not just to filter them). Finally, we examine the tradeoffs through simulations and show that our algorithm enables superior operating points.</br>
