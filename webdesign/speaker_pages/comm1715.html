It can help prioritize investments and can be used to help quantify an individual’s or team’s job performance.  This paper presents a model to quantify the financial ROI of Information Assurance (ROIA).  Potential users of the ROIA Model are encouraged to either use or modify this structure and populate the variables with their own data.</br>
