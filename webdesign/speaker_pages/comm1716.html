Title: Modulus Prediction of Poly (Vinyl Alcohol)-Treated Buckypaper based on Latent Variable Analysis<br>Author: Kan Wang, Post-Doctoral Fellow, Georgia Institute of Technology, 813 Ferst Dr. NW RM 375, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, kan.wang@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Arash Pourhabib, Chuck Zhang, Yu Ding, Jianhua Huang, Ben Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A finite element (FE) simulation is used to predict Young’s modulus of PVA-treated CNT buckypaper. Some input variable in the FE simulation is unobservable in the experiments. A latent variable analysis is developed to combine experiment outputs with simulation results, treating the unobservable variable as latent variable. A formulation for this latent variable analysis problem is presented, and a solution procedure based on non-linear optimization is developed.
