Title: Mean-risk Stochastic Optimization Approach for Chemotherapy Scheduling<br>Author: Tanisha Cotton, Doctoral Candidate, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, tanbgreen05@neo.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michelle M. Alvarado, Eduardo Perez, Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Oncology clinics face tight resource and scheduling constraints due to increased demand, cyclic chemotherapy treatment plans, and complex and uncertain duration of treatments. This talk presents the model and results of using a risk neutral and risk averse two-stage stochastic optimization approach to efficiently schedule chemotherapy nurses, patients, and chairs based on a real oncology clinic.
