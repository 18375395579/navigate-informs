<br>Title: Bounded Rationality and Learning in the Economic Order Quantity Setting</br><br>Author: Kay-Yut Chen, Hewlett-Packard, 3000 Hanover St, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, United States of America, kay-yut.chen@hp.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diana Wu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: While the Experience Weighted Attraction (EWA) model has success in explaining decision behavior in operations setting, it assumes the setting is static. We extend the EWA model to capture changing environments and allow individuals to learn from “similar?environments. The model is applied to an EOQ setting where the parameters (e.g. holding cost) are changing and we shows that this “learning from similar experience?effect is significant in a substantial fraction of the subjects.</br>
