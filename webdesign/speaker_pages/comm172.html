However, spreadsheets often require extensive use of VBA to accommodate large models. Thus, for large models the choice is not a specialized package vs. simple Excel, but rather a specialized package vs. very complex Excel and VBA. We discuss the pros and cons of this decision and suggest the best approach in various situations.</br>
