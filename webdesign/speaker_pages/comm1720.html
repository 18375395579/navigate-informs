We use Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 2008 to 2009 to predict increased dental utilization and to examine the feasibility of using dental claims data to evaluate dental care. We assign patients to hypothesized stages of care based on receipt of dental procedures and estimate transitions among stages of care with a Markov model. Obtained transition probabilities are validated against those obtained from chart reviews.</br>
