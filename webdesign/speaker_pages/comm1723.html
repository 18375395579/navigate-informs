Herrmann, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, College Park, MD, United States of America, jwh2@umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A medical disaster requires effective decision-making to coordinate the response.  For designing a decision-making system for this type of exceptional event, we present a systematic, scenario-based methodology that is based on the operational procedure methodology, which has been used to develop avionics systems.  We apply this approach to the case of medical disaster mutual aid, in which multiple hospitals must coordinate activities to respond to a mass casualty incident.</br>
