Title: Anomalous Group Detection<br>Author: Kaustav Das, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Av, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, kaustav@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Schneider, Daniel Neill<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a new method for detecting groups of anomalies.  Our approach is a generalization of the spatial scan statistic. We extend this framework to non-spatial data sets with discrete valued attributes by modeling the relationship between the attributes using a Bayesian Network. We show that this algorithm is able to accurately detect anomalous groups in real-world hospital, container shipping and network connections data.
