Title: A Location-inventory Model for Determining Station Locations and Fleet Size for Shared-Use Vehicles<br>Author: Burak Boyaci, Research Assistant, Ecole Polytechnique Federal de Lausanne, EPFL ENAC INTER LUTS, GC C2 406 (Bâtiment GC) Station 18, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland, burak.boyaci@epfl.ch<br>Coauthor(s): Nikolas Geroliminis, Konstantinos Zografos<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The problem of determining the fleet size and location of shared-use electric vehicle stations is modeled as a combined maximal covering inventory model. An efficient algorithm is used for solving the proposed model. We report results from the application of the model and algorithm to a real world problem with electric vehicles in the city of Nice.
