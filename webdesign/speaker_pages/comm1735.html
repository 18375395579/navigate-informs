Title: On Using Profile Monitoring Techniques for Monitoring Point Cloud Data<br>Author: Fadel Megahed, Assistant Professor, Auburn University, 3301L Shelby Center, Auburn, Al, United States of America, fmegahed@vt.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: 3D laser scanners can rapidly provide point clouds consisting of millions of data points, which depict the entire surface geometry of a manufactured part. Consequently, 3D scan data have a great potential to detect unexpected faults. However, SPC methods capable of handling these large data-sets are yet to be developed. In this talk, we show how 3D scanners can be used to significantly improve the monitoring capabilities for manufacturing parts, characterized by complex surface geometries.
