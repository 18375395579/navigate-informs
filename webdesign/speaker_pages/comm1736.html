Title: A Structured Approach to Identify Styles in Designs<br>Author: Tian Chan, PhD Student, INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Avenue, Singapore, 138676, Singapore, TianHeong.CHAN@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jurgen Mihm, Manuel Sosa<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A style is an organizing principle based on categorizing visually similar designs into a describable concept. This paper presents a structured approach to identifying styles using cluster analysis. Design patent data provides a unique opportunity to analyze style on a large scale due to a tightly controlled citation process which conveys similarity in visual impression between designs. Finally, we test styles developed using this approach against theory and perceptual experiments.
