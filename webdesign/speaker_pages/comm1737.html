Title: High-dimensional Sampling and Shake-and-bake Algorithms<br>Author: Ton Dieker, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, ton.dieker@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Santosh Vempala<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This talk discusses a method for sampling from the boundary of an n-dimensional convex body using Markov chains, where we think of n as being large. We analyze a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure known as the shake-and-bake algorithm. The methodology is applied to the ranking-and-selection problem from the theory of simulation.
