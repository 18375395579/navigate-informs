Title: A Change-point Approach for System Monitoring and Diagnosis Using Multichannel Profiles<br>Author: Kamran Paynabar, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, kamran.paynabar@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peihua Qiu, Changliang Zou<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Process monitoring and fault diagnosis using multichannel profile data remain an important problem in SPC. Motivated by a real application, this research develops a new monitoring and diagnosis framework for phase-I analysis of multichannel profiles. The proposed framework incorporates multi-dimensional functional principal component analysis into change-point models. The proposed methodology is validated via simulation and a case study.
