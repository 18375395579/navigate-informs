<br>Title: Spatial Design Strategies for Fitting Forward-Inverse Metamodels</br><br>Author: Russell Barton, Professor, Penn State University, Smeal College of Business, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, rbarton@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In simulation, metamodels approximate the simulation input-output function.  When there are multiple measures of performance, the same set of data used to fit the (forward) metamodels may be used to construct approximations for inverse functions.  These inverse maps are often useful for product or process design.  We show the performance of some strategies for constructing spatial experiment designs for fitting forward and inverse metamodels.</br>
