Title: Utilizing Multiple Wireless Roadside Sensors At Intersections<br>Author: David Kim, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, United States of America, david.kim@orst.edu<br>Coauthor(s): SeJoon Park, David Porte, Nadia Bathaee, Alireza Mohseni<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This research examines the estimation of vehicle time-distance trajectory through an intersection utilizing the data collection capabilities of multiple wireless roadside sensors that have been deployed along an intersection. Prior research with Bluetooth wireless roadside sensors show that signal strength data collected when data is obtained from a wireless device present in a vehicle can be used to estimate when the vehicle is close to passing a sensor. This capability is exploited through the development of portable Bluetooth wireless data collection units that communicate and synchronize time utilizing a Zigbee mesh network.
