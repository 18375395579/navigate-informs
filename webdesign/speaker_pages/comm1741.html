Title: Line Cancelling Transaction based Topology Control Extensions and Large System Applications<br>Author: Michael Caramanis, Boston University, 15 St. Mary's St., Room 137, Brookline, MA, 02446, United States of America, mcaraman@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Evgeniy Goldis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Line Cancelling Transactions (LCTs) can model the impact of transmission line switching on injection sensitivity factors [Guller, Gross and Liu,  2007].  Moreover, LCTs have been incorporated in a MILP topology control optimization algorithm (TCA) demonstrating orders of magnitude higher efficiency over previously used B Theta algorithms (Ruiz et al. 2012). We will present extensions to LCT-based TCA algorithms that model Losses, and report on large (multiple thousand buses) System applications.
