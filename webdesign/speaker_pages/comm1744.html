Title: Optimally Designed Perturbations for Uncovering Genetic Networks and Inverse Estimation<br>Author: Cenny Taslim, Graduate Associate, The Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Avenue, 210 Baker Systems, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, taslim.2@osu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The ability to insert specific genes into cells is increasing interest in the planning and analysis of perturbation experiments to predict gene, protein, and metabolite concentrations. Such experiments can show the mode of action of a drug by helping to inverse predict what genetic perturbations would be equivalent. We propose innovative experimental design techniques based on integer programming formulations to increase the accuracy of genetic models at minimum cost.
