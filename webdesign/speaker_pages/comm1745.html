Title: Optimal Location Problem of a Battery Switching Infrastructure Provider<br>Author: Buket Avci, INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France, buket.avci@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Serguei Netessine, Karan Girotra<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We analyze the location problem of a battery-switching infrastructure provider for the deployment of electric vehicles. Using a simple population model of motorists and an economic model of provider-firm behavior, we find the optimal number of switching stations and their location. Our analysis captures tthe trade-off between number of stations and service level at these stations. We calibrate our model with reasonable parameter values and evaluate the feasibility of this business model.
