Title: Mathematical Modeling of Pediatric Patients<br>Author: Jason Card, Graduate Student, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, jasonsc@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joe East, Emily Burns, Allison Cator, Michelle Macy, Amy Cohn, Natalie Eisert<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We use mathematical models and data analysis to observe how pediatric patients are treated and discharged. Asthma patients are a specific set of patients studied. We study length-of-stay and other metrics for patients using different discharge methods. We compare the results and discuss the implications of the findings.
