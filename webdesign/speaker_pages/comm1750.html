The lower-level model represents the equilibrium of a pool-based market; the intermediate level represents the Nash equilibrium in generation expansion, and the upper-level model represents the anticipation of transmission expansion to the investment in generation and the pool-based market equilibrium. The model is applied to a realistic power system in Chile to illustrate the methodology and proper conclusions are reached.</br>
