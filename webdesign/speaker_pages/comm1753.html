The models hypothesize that itinerary choice is based on a traveler’s effort to minimize schedule delay. Functions are estimated to represent passenger departure time preferences. The models differentiate between outbound vs. inbound passengers and between early vs. late schedule delay. Departure time-of-day preference patterns across the different days of the week, service offerings and distances are compared.
