Title: Performance-based Regularization in Mean-CVaR Portfolio Optimization<br>Author: Gah-Yi Vahn, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, gvahn@london.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a new regularization concept, performance-based regularization (PBR), to mean-CVaR portfolio optimization. We show via simulations that PBR substantially improves upon Sample Average Approximation in finite-sample performance for three different population models of stock returns. We also prove that PBR is asymptotically optimal and derive its first-order behavior by extending asymptotic analysis of M-estimators.
