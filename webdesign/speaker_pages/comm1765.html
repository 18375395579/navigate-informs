<br>Title: A New Linear Integer Formulation for the Ground Delay Program with Misconnections</br><br>Author: Jens Brunner, Professor, Universität Augsburg, Universitätsstr. 16, Augsburg, Germany, Jens.Brunner@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In the paper addresses the rescheduling problem by an airline when a ground delay program (GDP) is issued. The objective is to minimize delay measures and cost for crew and passenger misconnections subject to several restrictions. A new linear integer model is presented. Using a real-world example we show the efficiency of the modeling approach. High quality solutions can be found quickly and management can use the model to evaluate the trade-off between delays and misconnections.</br>
