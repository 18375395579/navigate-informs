It maximizes the expected earned run obtained by the optimal batting order with him, which based on Markov chain formulation of Baseball, and also minimizes a risk of the batter. This stochastic portfolio analysis suggests the decision for which batter is best. The model can impose manager's subjective perspective of the free agent batter.
