Title: Cartelization in the Natural Gas Industry, a Model-based Analysis<br>Author: Olivier Massol, Assistant Professor, IFP School, 228-232 Avenue Bonaparte, Rueil-Malmaison, 92852, France, olivier.massol@ifpen.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Albert Banal-Estañol, Steven Gabriel<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate the stability of a cartel gathering the main natural gas exporting countries. Our analysis uses a deterministic, discrete-time, finite-horizon oligopoly model capable to determine investment and production equilibrium strategies, in a setting where the demand's specification takes into consideration the adjustment dynamics of current consumption to both present and past prices. We assume a dynamic hierarchical pricing model ?la Stackelberg with a feedback information structure.
