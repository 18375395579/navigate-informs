Methodological issues regarding data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis are discussed. We tackle those issues using the convex non-parametric least square and analyze the effects of different contextual factors on efficiency frontier. Finally, we propose a Bayesian approach to derive efficiency estimates under flexible moment conditions.</br>
