<br>Title: Demand Heterogeneity in IT Infrastructure Services: A Dynamic Service Level Approach</br><br>Author: Raghu Santanam, Arizona State University, Box 874106, Arizona State University, Tempe, 85287, United States, Raghu.Santanam@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sagnika Sen, Ajay Vinze</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A key feature of service-oriented models of IT is the promise of pre-specified quality levels enforceable via SLAs. Since variance in expectations impact service levels, effective pricing and resource allocation mechanisms are needed to deliver services at the promised quality level. An analytical model and simulation is presented and evaluated for effectiveness of a proposed dynamic priority-based pricing scheme vis-?vis a baseline fixed-price single-quality level SLA.</br>
