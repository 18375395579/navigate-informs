Title: Capacitated Models for Designing Dispatching Rules for Semiconductor Fab<br>Author: Jayant Kalagnanam, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Hts 10591, United States of America, jayant@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Soumyadip Ghosh, James Luedtke<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Semiconductor fabs are typically managed using priority based dispatching.  We introduce a linear program to optimize the throughput while managing the product mix and use this solution to set priorities.
