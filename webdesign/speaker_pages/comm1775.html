Title: Enabling Increased Recycling & Renewable Materials use through Explicit Consideration of Uncertainty<br>Author: Randolph Kirchain, Principal Research Scientist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, E38-432, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, kirchain@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elsa Olivetti<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Increasing the use of recycled and renewable resources can enable energy savings, forestall depletion and avoid the deleterious effects of extraction. We discuss methods for increasing use of these materials through control of incoming feedstock quality variation. Research has shown that explicit incorporation of uncertainty, robust long term batch planning, and informed final product design through the use of stochastic programming can increase the use of recycled and renewable materials.
