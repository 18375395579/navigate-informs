Our model includes interacting agents representing the key stakeholders in the health system. The agents would respond to the policy by changing their behaviors. Using this model to study Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), the results show non-linear patterns of provider behaviors in responding to gradients of payment model in accordant with providers?priorities, suggesting payers to expand its strategies.</br>
