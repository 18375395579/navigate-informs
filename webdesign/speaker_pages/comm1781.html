Title: Gaussian Process Modeling for Measurement and Verification of Building Energy Savings<br>Author: Yeonsook Heo, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S.

We introduce an improved M&V method applying Gaussian Process (GP) modeling that can, using less measured data, capture nonlinear energy behavior and quantify prediction uncertainty.  A case study demonstrates the strengths of GP models for M&V and further explores their potential for analyzing different time resolution data.
