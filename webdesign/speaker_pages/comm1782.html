Title: A New Approach to Correlation of Types in Bayesian Games<br>Author: Luciano De Castro, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridon Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, l-decastro@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a new approach to the model of correlation of types in Bayesian games, which also allows asymmetries. This is related to the idea that “beliefs do not determine preferences,?and consists of modeling types with two explicit parts: one for preferences and another for beliefs. Building on this idea, we are able to provide the first pure strategy equilibrium existence for a general model of multi-unit auc- tions where types can be correlated.
