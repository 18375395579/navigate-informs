Title: Information Dissemination Delay in a Connected Vehicle Network Running on a Single Two-way Road<br>Author: Lili Du, Assistant Professor, Illinois Institute of Technology, 3201 S. Dearborn St., Chicago, IL, 60616, United States of America, ldu3@iit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hoang Dao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This research proposes mathematical description models to capture information propagation delay in a connected vehicle network running on a two-way road.  Intermittent wireless communication under dynamic traffic flow condition, and wireless communication interference among vehicles are integrated into the model development. The proposed models are validated are simulation experiments
