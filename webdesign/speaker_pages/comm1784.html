This is followed by an uncertainty analysis for quantifying uncertainties in WDS input data.  A few inputs include: demands, tank levels, and contaminant quantity.  It is shown that reasonable uncertainties in model inputs produce high variability in contamination exposure levels, requiring greater resources for effective mitigation.</br>
