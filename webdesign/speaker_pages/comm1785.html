This study aims at improving the performance of the reverse logistics network for medical waste management to minimize the risks. First, we predict the amount of waste generated at medical centers using an artificial neural network. Second, we optimize the distribution of the waste in the network using a genetic algorithm. The methodology is validated by an illustrative example.
