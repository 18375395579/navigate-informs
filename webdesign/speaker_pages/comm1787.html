<br>Title: An Examination of Correlation Assumptions Under CreditMetrics</br><br>Author: Sung-Ho Ahn, Wachovia Bank, 201 South College Street, Charlotte, NC, 28244, United States, sung-ho.ahn@wachovia.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Models of portfolio credit risk based on CreditMetrics utilize obligor asset correlations in loss distribution calculations. Given the computational burden of directly estimating the complete correlation matrix for all obligors, a factor model is typically employed to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. This article examines several issues that arise in counterparty risk attribution as a result of the assumptions behind the factor modeling and their impact on portfolio optimization.</br>
