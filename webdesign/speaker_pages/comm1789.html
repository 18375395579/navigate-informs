Title: Classifying U.S. Air Force Academy and Air Force ROTC Cadets into Initial Non-rated Career Fields<br>Author: Tara Terry, Operations Researcher, RAND Corporation, 1200 S. Hayes St., Arlington, VA, 22202, United States of America, tterry@rand.org<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Armacost, Preston Goodrich, Jim Lowe, Jason Williams<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: USAFA and ROTC used LP-based approaches for matching cadets to career fields by optimizing cadet preference and class standing while constrained by career field targets. In May 2012, USAFA and ROTC were combined into one classification model while adding 3 new features: spreading cadet quality, matching desired undergrad degrees, and a new methodology to combine USAFA and ROTC class standings. We present our modeling approach, computational results, and practical implementation of the model.
