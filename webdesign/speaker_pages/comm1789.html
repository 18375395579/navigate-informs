In May 2012, USAFA and ROTC were combined into one classification model while adding 3 new features: spreading cadet quality, matching desired undergrad degrees, and a new methodology to combine USAFA and ROTC class standings. We present our modeling approach, computational results, and practical implementation of the model.</br>
