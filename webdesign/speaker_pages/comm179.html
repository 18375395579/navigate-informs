<br>Title: What do Bayesian Testing of a Sharp Hypothesis and Reliability Models Have in Common?</br><br>Author: Ehsan Soofi, Distinguished Professor, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Sheldon B. Lubar School of Business, P.O. Box 742, Milwaukee, WI, 53021, United States of America, esoofi@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nader Ebrahimi, Nima Jalali</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Bayesian testing and some well-known reliability models involve singular distributions. The traditional indices of relationship fail to distinguish the dependence of singular models such as Marshall-Olkin and the exponential autoregressive bivariate distributions. The information measure of dependence is not defined.  A weighted average of the mutual information indices for the singular and absolutely continuous parts provides a common metric for comparing the dependence of these models.</br>
