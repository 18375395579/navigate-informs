Title: Estimating Runway Capacity with Simulation<br>Author: John Barrer, The MITRE Corporation, 7515 Colshire Drive, N370, McLean, VA, 22102, United States, jbarrer@mitre.org<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper describes a simulation technique for estimating the capacity and delay of a runway system. The process is unique in that the simulation code itself is controlled by a standardized set of parameters whose format remains the same for all airports in the world. This greatly reduces the time required to simulate an airport’s runway system.  The modeling technique is in use and has been successful for a wide range of airport operations.
