<br>Title: A Capacity Model for Emergency Call Centers</br><br>Author: Rob van der Mei, Cluster Leader, Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Science Park 123, Amsterdam, Netherlands, R.D.van.der.Mei@cwi.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Puts, Martin van Buuren, Geert-Jan Kommer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In life-threatening emergency situations, the ability of ambulance  service providers to arrive at the emergency scene within a few minutes may make the difference between survival or death. We study a capacity model for Emergency Medical Services call centers, including different types of callers and for each type the different steps involved in handling the calls from triage until hospitalization. The model is validated by real-life data. The results show that the model is highly accurate.</br>
