Title: Accuracies of Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) Heuristics based on DCOPF and ACOPF<br>Author: David Fuller, Professor, University of Waterloo, Department of Management Sciences, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, dfuller@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Milad Soroush<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: OTS models and heuristics have relied on the DCOPF approximation. We show, with a test system, that this can give poor choices for line removals, if cost reduction is estimated using the exact ACOPF. We extend a line ranking idea that was derived from the DCOPF, to a more general method based on the ACOPF, and we show that the line rankings are better than those based on the DCOPF, for the test system. We modify an OTS heuristic to use the ACOPF-based line rankings.
