<br>Title: Economic Evaluation of Tests to Determine the Source in Cancer of Unknown Primary</br><br>Author: Greg Zaric, Ivey Business School, 1151 Richmond St., London, ON, Canada, gzaric@ivey.uwo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Salah Mahmud, George Rodrigues, Peter Rogan, Malek Hannouf, Chong Kim, Sisira Sarma, Eric Winquist, Muriel Brackstone, Jeffrey Hoch</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) represents 3-5% of all new cancer cases. Recently, several tests have been developed to help identify the primary when conventional methods have failed. One particular test costs $4500 and has 70-90% accuracy in identifying the source in CUP. We develop a decision-analytic model to investigate the cost effectiveness of this test and parameterize the model using Canadian cancer registries, administrative databases, and secondary sources.</br>
