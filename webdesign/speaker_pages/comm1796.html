<br>Title: Average-case Analysis of VCG with Resource Allocation Algorithms</br><br>Author: Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Vanderbilt University, 2201 West End Ave, Nashville, TN, United States of America, eug.vorobey@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a framework for establishing an empirical bound on incentives to lie in VCG using approximate resource allocation algorithms.  We apply this framework on combinatorial auction data generated by CATS. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to past theoretical results, using state-of-the-art algorithms for solving combinatorial allocation problems results in essentially no incentives to misreport preferences.</br>
