Title: Bayesian Methods for Planning Accelerated Life Tests (ALTs)<br>Author: William Q. Meeker, Professor, Iowa State University, Department of Statistics, Ames, IA, 50011, United States, wqmeeker@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yao Zhang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk describes Bayesian methods for ALTs based on censored data from a log-location-scale distribution. We use a Bayesian criterion based on estimation precision of   a distribution quantile at a specified use condition to find optimum test plans. A large-sample normal approximation provides an useful simplification to this planning problem. We present a numerical example to illustrate the methods and to examine the effects of the prior distribution, censoring, and sample size.
