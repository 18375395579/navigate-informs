With a wealth of data available from onboard sensors, those data could better support maintenance and sustainment decisions if used effectively. We use sensor data and operational profiles to project when a component will cross its thresholds, considering component and supply chain uncertainty to predict when a component will require replacement and to trigger a demand signal.</br>
