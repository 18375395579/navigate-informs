We apply the result that DEA can be formulated as a convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS) regression to incorporate contextual variables in a single estimation. Evidence from Monte Carlo simulations suggests that the new 1-DEA estimator performs systematically better than the conventional 2-DEA estimator both in deterministic and noisy scenarios.</br>
