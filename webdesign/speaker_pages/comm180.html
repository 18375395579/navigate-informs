Title: One-stage and Two-stage DEA Estimation of the Effects of Contextual Variables<br>Author: Andrew Johnson, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX, United States of America, ajohnson@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Timo Kuosmanen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We re-examine the statistical properties of the 2-DEA estimator, and find that it is statistically consistent under more general conditions. We apply the result that DEA can be formulated as a convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS) regression to incorporate contextual variables in a single estimation. Evidence from Monte Carlo simulations suggests that the new 1-DEA estimator performs systematically better than the conventional 2-DEA estimator both in deterministic and noisy scenarios.
