Title: Characterization and Prediction of Air Traffic Delays<br>Author: Hamsa Balakrishnan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, 33-328, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, hamsa@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Juan Jose Rebollo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a new model for predicting delays in the National Airspace System (NAS), considering both temporal and spatial delay states as explanatory variables. We propose new network delay variables that depict the global delay state of the entire NAS at the time of prediction. The predictive performances of the proposed classification and regression models are evaluated using operational data, and the effects of changes in the classification threshold and prediction horizon are studied.
