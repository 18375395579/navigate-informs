Title: Credit Spreads, Optimal Capital Structure, and Implied Volatility<br>Author: Nan Chen, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Room 709A, William M. W.

T., Hong Kong - ROC, nc2005@columbia.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a two-sided jump model for credit risk by extending the Leland-Toft endogenous default model based on the geometric Brownian motion. The model shows that jump risk and endogenous default can have significant impacts on credit spreads, optimal capital structure, and implied volatility of equity options. Pricing formulae of credit default swaps and equity default swaps are also given.
