Title: D4S2 - Dynamic Discrete Disaster Decision Simulation System<br>Author: Bopaya Bidanda, Ernest Roth Professor & Chairman, Industrial Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, Bidanda@engr.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Kelley, Shengnan Wu, Carey Balaban, Larry Shuman, Ken Sochats<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Computer simulations are useful for planning improved responses to large-scale, complex disasters, which, due to their magnitude and multiple contingencies, are impractical to study in physical role-playing simulations. D4S2 integrates agent-based simulation, geographic information systems and discrete event simulation in a decision support tool for designing emergency response protocols.
