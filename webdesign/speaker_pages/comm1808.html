Title: Designing Multivariate Control Charts using Weighted Support Vector Machines<br>Author: Talayeh Razzaghi, Graduate Student, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States of America, talayeh.razzaghi@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Petros Xanthopoulos<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In quality control, automated algorithms are useful for early detection of abnormal patterns and avoidance of system malfunctions. In this work we present an overview of the literature of machine learning techniques used for control chart inspection and propose a modified K chart based on weighted Support Vector Machines (SVM) for unbalanced dataset demonstrating its practical application through sensitivity and specificity analysis.
