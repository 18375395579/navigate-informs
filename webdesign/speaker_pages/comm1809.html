The proposed decision analysis workflow includes identification of uncertainties related to petroleum reservoirs, costs of wells and facilities, prices and markets. Decisions made on the stages of exploration, appraisal, development, and production are based on analysis of these uncertainties. Actual production performance management helps to improve the quality of new decisions.</br>
