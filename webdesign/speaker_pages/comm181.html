Title: Some Recent Developments of Stochastic Kriging Methodology<br>Author: Xi Chen, Assistant Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, Statistical Sciences & Operations Resear, 1015 Floyd Avenue, Grace E.

We propose to extend the standard stochastic kriging in two directions, respectively, to enable SK to handle stochastic simulations involving both qualitative and quantitative decision variables and to upgrade SK with methods such as sectioning for better performance in predicting extreme quantiles and tail conditional expectations.
