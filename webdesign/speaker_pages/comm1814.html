In marketing, ranking is often the ultimate goal in building a regression model. Even when ranking is not the contextually correct performance metrics, our measures still have significant advantages: robustness against extreme outliers in the evaluation set; and interpretability. Our measures correspond closely to non-parametric correlation coefficients used in data analysis and both have interesting graphical representations.</br>
