<br>Title: Statistical Detection of Spatial Defect Patterns Using Hough Transform</br><br>Author: Qiang Zhou, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin Madison, ISyE Department, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, qzhou3@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shiyu Zhou</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Spatial patterns on wafer defect maps contain valuable information of the manufacturing processes. In this paper, we proposed a method to construct control chart for spatial pattern detection based on Hough Transform. Properties of the monitored statistic have been analyzed and the impact of Hough quantization parameters on Type II error rates has been studied.</br>
