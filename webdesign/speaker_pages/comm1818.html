Title: Monitoring and Adjusting Industrial Processes Simultaneously in One Control Chart<br>Author: Sin-Long Liu, National Tsing Hua University, 101, Section 2, Kuang-Fu Road, Hsinchu, Taiwan - ROC, d907806@oz.nthu.edu.tw<br>Coauthor(s): Wheyming Song<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Statistical process control and engineering process control are widely used to monitor and adjust industrial processes.  Assuming that EWMA scheme which is one kind of EPC is adopted and there are shifts and drifts in the processes, one problem from combination of SPC and EPC appears. Motivated by the problem that shifts can't be easily found due to the fact that EWMA scheme is adopted, we obtain some properties to both monitor and adjust processes simultaneously in one control chart.
