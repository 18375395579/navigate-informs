However, solver options are often specific to one solver, and syntax and interpretation may differ. Optimization Services is a web-aware framework providing a common interface between algebraic modeling languages (AMLs) and several open-source and commercial solvers. This talk describes the methods we used to overcome the difficulties encountered in connecting these solvers to a common AML.</br>
