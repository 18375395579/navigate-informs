Title: Connecting Algebraic Modeling Languages to Solvers<br>Author: Horand Gassmann, Professor, Dalhousie University, 6100 University Ave., Halifax, NS, Canada, Horand.Gassmann@dal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Kipp Martin, Jun Ma<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Loosely coupled systems in mathematical optimization allow easy substitution of one solver for another. However, solver options are often specific to one solver, and syntax and interpretation may differ. Optimization Services is a web-aware framework providing a common interface between algebraic modeling languages (AMLs) and several open-source and commercial solvers. This talk describes the methods we used to overcome the difficulties encountered in connecting these solvers to a common AML.
