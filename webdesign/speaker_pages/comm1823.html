<br>Title: Palisade Corporation-Avoiding Failure: Using @RISK to Identify, Analyze and Manage Risk More Successfully</br><br>Author: Rafael Hartke, Palisade Corporation, 798 Cascadilla St, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, rhartke@palisade.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Projects fail. They often fail for a lack of effective planning, either because of excess optimism in terms of time, cost and performance or because of extra work in the plan in terms of scope, resources and unforeseen events. @RISK employs Monte Carlo based simulation to give insight through sophisticated statistical analysis of the various potential outcomes. Understanding range outcomes facilitates effective risk management, prioritizing critical risks and managing expectations.</br>
