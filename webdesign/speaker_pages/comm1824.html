Title: Evaluating Weight Estimation Methods in Hybrid Ensembles<br>Author: Dirk Van den Poel, Professor of Marketing Analytics, Ghent University, Tweekerkenstraat 2, Ghent, 9000, Belgium, dirk.vandenpoel@ugent.be<br>Coauthor(s): Michel Ballings, Dauwe Vercamer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We evaluate multiple classifier fusion methods for a hybrid ensemble of the top-performing classifiers. We test 6 classifier fusion methods (Genetic Algorithm, Self-Organizing Migrating Algorithm, Memetic Algorithm with Local Search Chains, Differential Evolution Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization and Generalized Simulated Annealing) and 6 base classifiers (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Neural Networks, AdaBoost, Kernel Factory, and Logistic Regression) using AUC and 5x2CV.
