<br>Title: Characterizing and Detecting Unrevealed Elements of Network Systems</br><br>Author: James Leinart, Air Force Institute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way, Bldg 641, Wright Patterson AFB, OH, 45433, United States of America, james.leinart@afit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Deckro, James Moore, David Denhard, Robert Mills, Marcus Perry</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A method to identify hidden nodes that connect network components is presented. A procedure to reconstruct networks from partial information using a stochastic observation process is also introduced. Associated analysis includes network characteristics impacting reconstruction, and accuracy assessment of the reconstructed network. The procedure implements causality, reconstructability analysis and graph theoretic concepts.</br>
