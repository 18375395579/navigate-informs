<br>Title: Improving Mass Vaccination and Dispensing Operations and Logistics</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Herrmann, University of Maryland, Department of Mechanical Engineering, College Park, MD, United States of America, jwh2@umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: To prepare for a biological attack or epidemic, public health departments must plan mass dispensing and vaccination clinics.  We have been collaborating with public health professionals to develop models to improve clinic operations and logistics.  Based on key clinic parameters, clinic planning models estimate clinic capacity and the time patients spend in the clinic.  Resupply planning models are used for planning the continuous resupply of clinics during mass dispensing.</br>
