<br>Title: Staffing IT Support Systems via Queueing Models with Mixed Priorities</br><br>Author: Sergey Zeltyn, IBM, IBM Haifa Research Lab, Haifa, Israel, SERGEYZ@il.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zohar Feldman, Segev Wasserkrug</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In our work on workforce management for IT support systems, we encountered the joint use of both preemptive and non-preemptive priority protocols. We present theoretical research on a queueing model with mixed priorities that includes calculation of Laplace transforms for waiting and sojourn times. In a practical part of the research, application of mixed priorities for different types of Service Level Agreements is discussed and supported by an example based on a real-life scheduling problem.</br>
