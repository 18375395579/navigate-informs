Title: Comparing Investments in Hardening, Robustness and Recovery Against Intelligent Attacks<br>Author: Sinan Tas, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University-Berks, 1800 Broadcasting Road, Reading, PA, 19610, United States of America, sinantas@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Vicki Bier<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We have developed a game-theoretic model that can evaluate the resilience of an electric power system from intelligent attacks taking into account the impact of both cascading failure and system restoration. In this talk, we use our model to evaluate not only component hardening, but also investments in robustness (reducing the likelihood of cascading failure) and recovery (reducing component restoration times).
