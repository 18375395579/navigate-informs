Both have an exact graph structure for propagating flow (vehicles or SKUs) under capacity and congestion constraints. The modeling units (cell or facility) differentiate the spatio-temporal analysis. Common concepts, like the existence of a state variable, are highly indicative of the potential of a common modeling framework for transportation and production planning.</br>
