<br>Title: Modeling of Consolidation by Household for Emergency Evacuation Events</br><br>Author: Ke Liu, Ph.D. Student, University of Maryland, 1173 Martin Hall, Dept. of Civil Engineering, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, ke.liu@fhwa.dot.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Lovell, Peter Chang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Evacuation studies have grown in importance over the years.One effective method to evaluate different evacuation strategies is the use of simulation.In this study,we develop a computerized tool for modeling evacuation dynamics with household consolidation,and then incorporate it into a traffic-simulation software platform.This tool will allow a percentage of the population to consolidate as a family before they evacuate.</br>
