<br>Title: Drift in Transaction-level Asset Price Models</br><br>Author: Wen Cao, New York University, 44 West 4th St., New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, wcao@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cliff Hurvich, Philippe Soulier</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the effect of drift in pure-jump transaction-level models for asset prices in continuous time, driven by point processes. It links properties of durations (heavy tails and long memory) to properties of average returns, making it difficult to determine growth rates. We focus on a univariate model for log price, allowing for both long memory and heavy tails in durations. We propose a robust ratio statistic, obtain its limiting distributions, and employ subsampling to test growth rates.</br>
