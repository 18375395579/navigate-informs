It links properties of durations (heavy tails and long memory) to properties of average returns, making it difficult to determine growth rates. We focus on a univariate model for log price, allowing for both long memory and heavy tails in durations. We propose a robust ratio statistic, obtain its limiting distributions, and employ subsampling to test growth rates.
