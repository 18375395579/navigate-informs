The system uses approximate dynamic programming, which allows us to capture operations at a very high level of detail.  It combines the power and flexibility of Cplex to make good decisions at a point in time, while using ADP to optimize over time.  The model closely matches actual operations, and can be used for strategic, tactical and real-time planning.</br>
