Title: Locomotive Optimization for Norfolk Southern using Approximate Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Warren Powell, Princeton University, Department of ORFE, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, powell@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Belgacem Bouzaiene-Ayari<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe a locomotive optimization model which allows Norfolk Southern to perform a wide range of strategic planning exercises.  The system uses approximate dynamic programming, which allows us to capture operations at a very high level of detail.  It combines the power and flexibility of Cplex to make good decisions at a point in time, while using ADP to optimize over time.  The model closely matches actual operations, and can be used for strategic, tactical and real-time planning.
