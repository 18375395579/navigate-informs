Title: Modeling and Simulation of an Oncology Clinic using DEVS<br>Author: Michelle M. Alvarado, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, michelle.mcgaha@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Eduardo Perez, Tanisha Cotton, Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Scheduling of chemotherapy treatments is a difficult task due to the cyclic nature of the prescribed treatment regimen, variability of treatment lengths, and patient acuity levels.  We present a discrete event system specification (DEVS) simulation model integrated with a stochastic mixed integer programming model (SMIP) to schedule and manage patients in an oncology clinic.  Preliminary results are presented from the management perspective.
