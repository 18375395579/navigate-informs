Such factors are often called nested factors. A factor within which other factors are nested is called a branching factor. Design and analysis of experiments with branching and nested factors have not received much attention. In this paper, a new class of designs and a modified kriging model are proposed. This method is illustrated using a computer experiment on hard turning operation.
