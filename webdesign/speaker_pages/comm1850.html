<br>Title: The Foundations of Irregular Warfare (IW)</br><br>Author: Dean Hartley, Principal, Hartley Consulting, 106 Windsong Ln, Oak Ridge, TN, 37830, United States of America, DSHartley3@comcast.net</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lee Lacy</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: IW operations are hard: they connect to the human domain, where our knowledge is weak. Recent conflicts have produced demands for models of IW. Ontologies provide a tool for representing IW. They specify vocabularies & semantic relationships.  We show ontologies of IW actor, action, & environment concepts and state variables.  They come from several sources. The semantics permit programmatic inferencing. The ontologies are useful for modeling, data interchange, interoperability, and V&V.</br>
