Title: Efficiency-based Quantitative Asset Selection<br>Author: Irene Song, Columbia University, Columbia University, 120 Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, is2306@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Soulaymane Kachani, Iraj Kani<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk, we propose an efficiency-based asset selection methodology that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA), a non-parametric productivity analysis of relative efficiencies of economic entities, with fundamental analysis in a disciplined manner.  We test our strategy in both equity and currency markets and evaluate its performance relative to market benchmarks and widely used regression-based techniques.
