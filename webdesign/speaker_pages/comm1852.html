Title: Are Living-donor Liver Transplants Timed to Maximize Life Expectancy?<br>Author: Sepehr Nemati Proon, PhD Student, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Department of Industrial Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, sepehr.nemati@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Roberts, Burhaneddin Sandikci, Andrew Schaefer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The major clinical decision in living-donor liver transplantation is the appropriate time to transplant. We use a Markov decision process model parameterized with clinical data to optimize the timing of the transplant decision for a given end-stage liver disease patient with a living-donor. We compare the timing decision suggested by this model, which maximizes patient’s total discounted life expectancy, to the actual transplant decision of the patient and present the results for 721 patients.
