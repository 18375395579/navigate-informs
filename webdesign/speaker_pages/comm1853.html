Customers who belong to a low fare class but find the class closed, are assumed to buy up to a higher fare with a certain probability. We discuss the performance of such models in settings where choice behavior is actually more complex. We analyze the evolution of booking limits from a buy-up model, assuming the firm uses a seemingly reasonable method to turn booking records into input to the model.</br>
