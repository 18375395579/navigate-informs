Title: Cost-effectiveness of Expanded HIV Treatment among Pregnant Women in Ghana<br>Author: Adam VanDeusen, Master of Public Health Candidate, Yale School of Public Health, 234 Park Street, New Haven, CT, 06511, United States of America, adam.vandeusen@yale.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elisa Long, Elijah Paintsil, Thomas Agyarko-Poku<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend short-term antiretroviral treatment for healthy, HIV+ pregnant women (Option B), but a longer course of therapy (Option B+) may reduce vertical transmission in future pregnancies, improve maternal outcomes, and be more cost-effective. We develop a state-transition Markov model, calibrated to HIV demographics and behavior in Ghana, to evaluate alternative treatment scenarios. The analysis aims to help inform HIV treatment policies in Ghana.
