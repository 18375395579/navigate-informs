The model combines the ground-holding and rerouting and is formulated as a heuristic shortest path problem. The probabilistic model generates flyable probabilities of storms from weather forecast. The ground-holding and rerouting model is implemented on the NAS network using results of the probabilistic model as its input.</br>
