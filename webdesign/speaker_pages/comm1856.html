<br>Title: Combination of Supervised and Unsupervised Segmentation of Pubis for Diagnosis of Pelvic Organ Prolapse</br><br>Author: Sinan Onal, Doctoral Candidate, University of South Florida, 4200 E. Fowler Ave., ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33617, United States of America, sonal@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Susana Lai-Yuen, Paul Bao, Alfredo Weitzenfeld, Stuart Hart</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) is a major health problem affecting up to 30-50 percent of women.Diagnosis of POP through dynamic MRI has become popular due to inaccuracies of clinical examination.We present a new segmentation approach for automating pelvic bone point identification on MRI using a multi-stage mechanism based on the texture-based block classification and K-means clustering analysis to diagnose POP on MRI.</br>
