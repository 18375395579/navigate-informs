Title: An Efficient Method for Uncertainty Quantification for Gear Life Prediction<br>Author: Zhigang Tian, Concordia University, 1515 Ste-Catherine Street West, Montreal, Canada, tian@ciise.concordia.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Fuqiong Zhao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in damage growth is critical in equipment health prognosis. In existing work, simulation is commonly used to account for the uncertainty in prognostics. In this paper, a stochastic collocation approach is developed for efficient integrated gear health prognosis, involving evaluating gear remaining useful life prediction uncertainty as well as the likelihood function in Bayesian inference. Examples are used to demonstrate that the proposed approach.
