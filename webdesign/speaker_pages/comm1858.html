<br>Title: Integrating Patient Compliance Models into a Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Evaluation Simulation</br><br>Author: Irene Vidyanti, University of Southern California, 1179 W 29th Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90007, United States of America, vidyanti@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shinyi Wu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Current simulation models to aid evaluation of screening strategies do not have a structure that enables the evaluation of strategies that include policies affecting screening compliance, even though such strategies are often necessary to achieve maximum cost-benefit, especially when current compliance levels are low. This research develops a model addressing the shortcoming by including compliance as a mediating variable in the model and illustrates this using the case of Diabetic Retinopathy.</br>
