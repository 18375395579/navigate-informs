Title: System Optimal and User Equilibrium in CTM-based DTA<br>Author: Georgios Kalafatas, Purdue University, United States of America, gkalafat@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The two most widely used traffic assignment objectives, the SO and the UE, have been recently modeled in CTM-based DTA model. In our research, we interpret the SO and UE routing patterns from a graph theoretic perspective by using the Graph Theoretic CTM (GT-CTM). Theoretical and practical insights are drawn for different traffic density conditions for the single destination DTA case.
