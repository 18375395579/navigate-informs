<br>Title: Research Proposal: The Cognitive Aspects of Scheduling</br><br>Author: Yishai Boasson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, yishai@MIT.EDU</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We wish to understand how expert schedulers modify scheduling heuristics and choose between them. Field research methods will be used to collect data about expert scheduler behavior. Data will be compared and contrasted with lab data. Insights gained can be used in models for system design. This is different from previous works, as it is concerned with how schedulers make decisions, rather than with what those decisions are, or with benchmarking scheduler performance against normative theory.</br>
