The Borg MOEA utilizes auto-adaptive search to tailor itself to effectively explore challenging problem spaces.  This study benchmarks the Borg MOEA relative to other top MOEAs for the GAA problem using control map analysis and the first application of global variance decomposition on a complex real-world problem.</br>
