Title: Diagnostic Assessment of the Borg MOEA for Many-objective Product Family Design Problems<br>Author: David Hadka, PhD Candidate Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, 212 Sackett Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, dmh309@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Simpson, Patrick Reed<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study provides a detailed analysis of the Borg Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) on the severely-constrained, ten objective General Aviation Aircraft (GAA) problem.  The Borg MOEA utilizes auto-adaptive search to tailor itself to effectively explore challenging problem spaces.  This study benchmarks the Borg MOEA relative to other top MOEAs for the GAA problem using control map analysis and the first application of global variance decomposition on a complex real-world problem.
