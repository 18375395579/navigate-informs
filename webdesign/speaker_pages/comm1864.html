Such heterogeneity, conventionally modeled as unknown parameters or unobservable random variables, may be caused by the variations. This paper proposes a semi-latent hazard regression (SLHR) model to explicitly quantify the impact of manufacturing process variation on reliability heterogeneity. The advantages of applying the SLHR model in burn-in process are discussed.</br>
