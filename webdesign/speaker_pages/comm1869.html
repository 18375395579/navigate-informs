Title: Robotic Cells with Parallel Machines and Multiple Dual Gripper Robots<br>Author: Neil Geismar, Assistant Professor, Prairie View A&M University, PO Box 638, Prairie View, TX, United States, ngeismar@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Pinedo, Chelliah Sriskandarajah<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider different actual implementations of robotic cells with multiple dual gripper robots.  We provide schemes to prevent robot collisions, discuss cell layout issues, and find optimal move sequences.  Additionally, we use simulation to evaluate sequences for a cell with stochastic processing times.
