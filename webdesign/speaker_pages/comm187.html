<br>Title: Dynamic Modeling of Maintenance Policies Using Stochastic Petri Nets with Aging Tokens</br><br>Author: Vitali Volovoi, Senior Research Engineer, Georgia Institute of Technology, 270 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0150, United States, vitali.volovoi@ae.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The benefits of improving existing maintenance policies are vast, as are the associated challenges. Appropriate resource allocation is impossible without comprehensive system-level modeling of failure and repair. Dynamic interactions among factors affecting operations, degradation, and maintenance must be quantitatively accounted for. To this end, a framework based on Petri nets is introduced; it is capable of modelling imperfect inspection and maintenance, opportunistic repair, and logistics.</br>
