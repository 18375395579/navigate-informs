<br>Title: Nested Queuing Models for En Route Traffic and Controller-pilot Communication Messages</br><br>Author: Jasenka Rakas, Institute of Transportation Studies, 107 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, jrakas@ce.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper uses nested queuing for modeling en route traffic and controller-pilot communication messages. Communication is maintained either by radios or data link. The concept of priority queuing is introduced, where voice messages have higher priority and text messages have lower priority. Based on a mathematical model, it is proved that the use of data link reduces (1) congestion in communications and (2) the expected waiting time of the message queue.</br>
