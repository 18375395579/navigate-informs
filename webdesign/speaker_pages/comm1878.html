Shockwave propagation is well captured by checking the difference of queue forming and dissipation end. A small numerical example is compared with Cell Transmission Model and Point Queue model, confirming the model? accuracy in travel time estimation. Two more tests are conducted on a hypothetical network and the Manhattan network, confirming the model? efficiency in large scale network simulation.
