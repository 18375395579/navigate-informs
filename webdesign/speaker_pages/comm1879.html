Title: Hierarchical Model for Estimating Values in Sponsored Search<br>Author: Eric Sodomka, PhD Candidate, Brown University, 115 Waterman Street, 4th Floor, Providence, RI, United States of America, sodomka@cs.brown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dustin Hillard, Sebastien Lahaie<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose an approach to predicting sponsored search advertisers' keyword values based on bidding behavior across the terms and campaigns in an account. We propose an economically meaningful loss function which allows us to implicitly fit a hierarchical linear model for values given observables such as bids and click-through rates. Its predictive quality is evaluated on several high-revenue and high-exposure advertising accounts on a major search engine.
