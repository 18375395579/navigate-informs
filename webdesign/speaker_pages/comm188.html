A structural equation model with latent variables is adopted for analysis based on the revealed preference data from a driving simulator experiment and stated preference data from a survey. Three types of information-related stresses are identified as important factors to infer on driver’s benefits from real-time travel information as well as conventional travel time savings.</br>
