Title: Estimation of Directed Acyclic Graphs under Poisson Log-normal Data for Gene Networks<br>Author: Sung Won Han, Research Scientist, New York University, 650 First Avenue, New York, NY, United States of America, SungWon.Han@nyumc.org<br>Coauthor(s): Hua Zhong<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Many expressions in gene networks are recorded as count data, which can be assumed to follow compounded Poisson data. This presentation discusses the estimation of the structure of the directed acyclic graph under the Poisson log-normal data by L_1-penalized likelihood approach. By Laplace integral approximation, we convert the penalized likelihood with Bayes framework into a simple objective function, and use two iterative optimization steps to estimate the structure of the graph.
