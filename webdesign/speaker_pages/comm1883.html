<br>Title: On the Effectiveness of Patenting Strategies</br><br>Author: Fabian Sting, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, Netherlands, FSting@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jurgen Mihm, Tan Wang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: What patenting strategy should a company pursue? What factors should the choice of strategy depend on?  We build a coherent inventory of patenting strategies and we integrate it into a common coherent framework. Through a simulation model, we identify competitive dynamics as the most crucial contingency and within our framework we characterize the optimal patenting choices. Our research makes a step towards a contingency theory of patenting strategies.</br>
