<br>Title: Association Rules for Recommendations with Multiple Items</br><br>Author: Abhijeet Ghosal, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States of America, abhijeet@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sumit Sarkar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose new association rules, termed disjunctive consequent rules that maximize the probability of selecting at least one of the recommended items and are more suitable for recommending items in online environments. An algorithm to mine such rules is developed which uses several properties of the problem to prune the search space while mining such rules. Experiments show that using disjunctive consequent rules provides more accurate recommendations than using conjunctive rules.</br>
