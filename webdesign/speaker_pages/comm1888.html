<br>Title: Applying Air Traffic Flow Management Optimization Models to Railroad Train Scheduling</br><br>Author: Lingyun Meng, School of Traffic and Transportation, 8507D, No.8 Teaching Building, No.3 ShangYuanCun, HaiDian District, China, lymeng@bjtu.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuesong Zhou</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: By analyzing a variety of air traffic flow management models, this paper proposes a cumulative flow count based optimization model for train scheduling problem under stochastic segment capacity breakdowns. The “capacity aggregation?technique is used to capture the uncertainty of capacity breakdown incidents. A Lagrangian relaxation based solution approach is presented to solve this model. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution approach.</br>
