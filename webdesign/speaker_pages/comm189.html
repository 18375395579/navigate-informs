This paper develops a novel data-level fusion technique that includes a generic chain of data selection, processing and fusion steps, specifically for degradation modeling and prognostic purposes. Case studies are conducted based on the aircraft gas turbine engine, which is generated by the C-MAPSS simulator at NASA.</br>
