Title: The Development and Field Testing of Freeway Point-to-point Travel Time Prediction Model<br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E. 2nd St., Tucson, AZ, United States, chiu@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brenda Bustillos<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present the development and field testing of an N-Curve-based approach for freeway point-to-pint travel time prediction. The main modeling challenges including the consideration of on and off ramps and the prediction accuracy under a variety of traffic congestion levels will discussed. Field testing was conducted using data collected from 10 RTMS detector data on a 7-mile long highway segment.
