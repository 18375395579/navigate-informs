<br>Title: IC-Card System's Technical Simulation Model Analysis</br><br>Author: Donghun Yoon, Keio University, Graduate School of Media and Governance, 5322 Endo Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 252-8520, Japan, nature@sfc.keio.ac.jp</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: IC-Card provides a means of effecting business transactions in a flexible,secure,standard way with minimal human intervention. It has been applied to various fields: the traffic IC-Card(Suica,Pasmo,Mobile),Electronic Money(Edy),Credit Card,ID Card. This paper describes IC-Card system's efficient improvement direction by theoretical study of IC-Card system's technical simulation model analysis. This study would contribute to scientific reaserch and enhance the value of IC-Card system model study.</br>
