<br>Title: Transform Methods in Financial Engineering</br><br>Author: Liming Feng, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, fenglm@illinois.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Fourier transform based methods have become standard computational tools in financial engineering. They are particularly useful for derivatives valuation in models with known characteristic functions only. When the analyticity of the characteristic functions is utilized, Fourier methods become highly efficient with exponentially decaying approximation errors. We illustrate the effectiveness of Fourier methods with financial engineering examples, including the valuation of European, American and exotic options, and Monte Carlo simulation from analytic characteristic functions.</br>
