Title: The Incorporation of Multiple Scales in Efficiency Measurement: A Reconsideration<br>Author: Kostas Triantis, Program Director, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA, 22230, United States of America, triantis@vt.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to revisit some of the basic issues (measurement scales, coding, types of ordinal data, meaningful transformations) in the context of incorporating qualitative information expressed with ordinal scales in efficiency modeling paradigm. We provide insights by representing a simple counter example and we experiment using data from the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPC) project plans where a subset of these variables have been measured using ordinal scales.
