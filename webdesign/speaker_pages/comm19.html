<br>Title: Improving Credit Risk and Customer-Centric Models Using Genetic Algorithms</br><br>Author: Russell Walker, Assistant Director, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, russell-walker@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Financial service firms have invested heavily in analytics for credit risk management and for marketing. Complexity and the scale of candidate variables have also created an opportunity to search for better models and novel variables. This talk will examine how genetic algorithms have been successfully deployed for credit risk modeling and customer behavior modeling. The talk will also highlight the economics of using genetic algorithms to reduce costs and increase time to market of analytics.</br>
