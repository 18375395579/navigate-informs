Title: Semi-open Queuing Network Analysis of Autonomous Vehicle Storage and Retrieval Systems<br>Author: Sunderesh Heragu, Professor, University of Louisville, 309, JB Speed Bldg, Industrial Engineering department, Louisville, KY, 40292, United States of America, s.heragu@louisville.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Krishnamurthy, Charles Malmborg, Xiao Cai<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) is a relatively new automated material handling technology. There are very few analytical performance evaluation models  available in the literature for an AVS/RS. The semi-open queuing network (SOQN) methodology is used to model the AVS/RS, and solved via a heuristic algorithm. The heuristic results are compared with those of simulation.
