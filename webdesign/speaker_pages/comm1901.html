Title: Extending an Open Source Algebraic Modeling Software to Support a  Algorithm Development<br>Author: Suleyman Karabuk, Assistant Professor, University of Oklahoma, School of Industrial Engineering, 200 West Boyd, Room 124, Norman, OK, 73019, United States, karabuk@ou.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose extending algebraic modeling languages so that solution algorithms that are based on iteratively modifying, manipulating, and solving a model are supported at a high abstraction level. We specifically focus on Stochastic Programming models and mathematical decomposition algorithms. We identify the necessary language constructs, and develop a design based on the open source modeling software APLEpy.
