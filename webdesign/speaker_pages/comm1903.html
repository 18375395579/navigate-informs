Title: A Nonlinear Programming Approach for the Estimation of Large-scale Infectious Disease Models<br>Author: Carl Laird, Assistant Professor, Chemical Engineering Dept.

Using the TSIR model as a basis, we develop large-scale nonlinear programming formulations for estimating model parameters using long time-series information on reported cases. These estimates provide insight into the fundamental drivers affecting the spread of infectious disease.
