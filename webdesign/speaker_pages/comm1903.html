<br>Title: A Nonlinear Programming Approach for the Estimation of Large-scale Infectious Disease Models</br><br>Author: Carl Laird, Assistant Professor, Chemical Engineering Dept. Texas A&M University, 3122 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, carl.laird@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Young, Derek Cummings</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A reliable mechanistic model for infectious disease spread allows public health officials to make more informed decisions, while improving scientific understanding of the factors affecting transmission of the disease.  Using the TSIR model as a basis, we develop large-scale nonlinear programming formulations for estimating model parameters using long time-series information on reported cases. These estimates provide insight into the fundamental drivers affecting the spread of infectious disease.</br>
