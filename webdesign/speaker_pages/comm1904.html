<br>Title: A GIS, Optimization and Simulation Framework for Optimal PV Size and Location in Campus Environments</br><br>Author: Amirreza M. Khaleghi, The University of Arizona, 1127 E. James E. Rogers Way  P.O. Box 21, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0020, United States of America, amirreza@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ye Zhang, Ferenc Szidarovszky, Guzin Bayraksan, Sadik Kucuksari, Maryam Hamidi, Young-Jun Son</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A framework integrating GIS, optimization, and simulation modules is proposed to obtain the optimal placement and size for photovoltaic (PV) panels in a campus area. The GIS module finds the suitable rooftops and their panel capacity. The optimization module is then used to maximize the long term profit of PV installations. Voltage profile of the electricity distribution network is investigated in the simulation module. The proposed framework has been successfully demonstrated for a real case.</br>
