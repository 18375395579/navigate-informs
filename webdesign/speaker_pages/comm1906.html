Title: A Run-to-Run Profile Control Algorithm for Improving the Flatness of Nano-scale Products<br>Author: Xin Wang, PhD Candidate, Tsinghua University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Beijing, China, xinwang09@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Su Wu, Kaibo Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In scaling-up Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) array manufacturing, the geometric quality of the array is characterized by the flatness of a nonlinear profile. In this work, we propose a run-to-run profile controller based on a state-space model and Kalman filter to improve the flatness of the CNTs array.  The performance of the proposed run-to-run control algorithm is studied and compared with existing controller via simulation studies.
