Title: A p-Robust Multi-commodity Network Design Model with Disruptions<br>Author: Peng Peng, PhD Candidate, Lehigh University ISE Dept.,, 200 W.Packer Ave., Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, pep206@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence V. Snyder<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a multi-commodity network design problem in which random disruptions are modeled using scenarios.  The model makes open/close decisions in the first stage and flow decisions in the second. We consider a bill-of-materials that specifies how input products are combined at each node. We propose a p-robust model which minimizes the nominal cost, while bounding the cost that can occur in each scenario. We also provide insights obtained from computational results.
