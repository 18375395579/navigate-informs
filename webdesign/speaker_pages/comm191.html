Title: Optimization of Concentrating Solar Power with Thermal Energy Storage in a Production Cost Model<br>Author: Marissa Hummon, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 15013 Denver West Parkway, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, Marissa.Hummon@nrel.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Denholm, Jennie Jorgenson, Mark Mehos<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Concentrating solar power with thermal energy storage (CSP-TES) can provide multiple benefits to the grid, but must be modeled to allow for the optimization of each component of the plant. We present a high fidelity model of CSP-TES, show the value of CSP-TES in a high renewable penetration scenario, and the effect of modeling simplifications including scheduled versus optimized dispatch and 24-hour ahead dispatch versus real time sub-hour dispatch, on the value of CSP-TES.
