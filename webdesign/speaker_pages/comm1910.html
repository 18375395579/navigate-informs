<br>Title: A Methodology for Classification and Detection of Helicopter Bearing Faults</br><br>Author: David He, Associate Professor, University of Illinois at Chicago, davidhe@uic.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, the development of a general methodology using wavelet analysis integrated with data mining approaches for classification and detection of helicopter swashplate bearing faults will be reported.  A successful application of the developed methodology to recent seeded fault tests for US Army CH-47D and MH-47E swashplate bearings will be discussed.</br>
