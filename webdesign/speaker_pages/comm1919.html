Holden Professor of Management Science, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, wein_lawrence@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Atkinson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We construct a hierarchical model for pandemic influenza, which embeds a three-compartment model of the household within a household epidemic model. We use data to quantify airborne vs. contact transmission for influenza, and assess the effectiveness of various nonpharmaceutical interventions within the household during a pandemic influenza outbreak.
