Title: Anticipatory Routing of Police Helicopters<br>Author: Rick van Urk, PhD Candidate, University of Twente, Dep. Industrial Engineering and Business, P.O. Box 217, Enschede, 7500 AE, Netherlands, r.vanurk@utwente.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Martijn Mes, Erwin Hans<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We have developed an application for the Dutch Aviation Police for routing their helicopters in anticipation of future incidents that are unknown in advance, yet do require a swift response. We generate a forecast, and use a heuristic to determine the departure times and the routes. The underlying problem is a combination of the Location Covering Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. As the simulation results are promising, the Dutch Aviation Police now uses the application in practice.
