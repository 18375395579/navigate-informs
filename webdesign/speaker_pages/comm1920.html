Macaleer '63 Professor in Engineering and Applied Science, Princeton University, Department of Chemical Engineering, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, floudas@titan.princeton.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: An integrated operational planning and medium-term scheduling framework which takes into account various forms of market and process uncertainty will be presented.  The framework entails the integration of a novel and robust Planning with Production Disaggregation Model with the robust scheduling model through a forward rolling horizon scheme, and was applied to an industrial case study in order to demonstrate that it can address relevant planning and scheduling problems.</br>
