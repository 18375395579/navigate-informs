Title: Optimization Models to Characterize the Broadcast Capacity of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks<br>Author: Lili Du, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, dul@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shivkumar Kalyanaraman, Satish Ukkusuri, Wilfredo Yushimito Del Valle<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This study defines the maximum successful concurrent transmissions  as the broadcast capacity of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET).  Integer Programming (IP) and statistical models are developed to  explore the maximum concurrent successful receivers or transmitters  in VANET. Response surface and linear regression technologies are  applied to build the statistical models.
