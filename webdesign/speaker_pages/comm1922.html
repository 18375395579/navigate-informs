<br>Title: Effectiveness of Parallel Computing for Mixed Integer Programming Using Xpress-MP</br><br>Author: Gabriel Tavares, Consultant, Dash Optimization Inc, 560 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632, United States, gabriel.tavares@dashoptimization.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alkis Vazacopoulos, Richard Laundy</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Xpress-MP features sophisticated, robust algorithms to quickly and accurately solve industry's most demanding Mixed Integer Programming Problems (MIPs) with millions of variables and constraints. Xpress Parallel-MIP harnesses the power of multi-core machines to give impressive performance improvements over a large set of models. In this work we investigate the impact of using parallel computing to reduce the solution times across different types of MIPs derived from real world applications.</br>
