Title: Enhancing Student Learning in Virtual Computer Laboratories through Experiential Learning<br>Author: Abdullah Konak, Professor of Information Sciences and Technology, Penn State Berks, Tulpehocken Road, P.O.

Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle is proposed as a framework to design hands-on activities for virtual computer laboratories.  Empirical results are reported from two studies involving 169 students to test the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
