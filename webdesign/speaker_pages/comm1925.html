Title: The Use of Spatial Statistical Analysis for Image Based Part Inspection<br>Author: Jaime Camelio, Associate Professor, Virginia Tech, 235 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, United States of America, jcamelio@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lee Wells<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Traditional quality control tools are based upon extracting features and measuring discrete dimensional data. However, new data-sets that are highly heterogeneous (multiple sensor types measuring different phenomena) and data-rich (thousands or even millions of data points). This presentation will use a case study of high-speed micro-scale part inspection using digital images and 3D laser scanning data. A cross-sensor spatial inspecting technique will be presented and its performance analyzed.
