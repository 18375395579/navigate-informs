In this talk we describe how to detect anomalous patterns that are characterized by the distribution of the group of objects. Based on the topic modeling technique, we develop generative models that are suited to this task. The effectiveness of this approach is verified by experiments on images, turbulence simulation, and astronomical spectra.</br>
