<br>Title: Robust Routing for Battery Electric Vehicles</br><br>Author: Daniel Reich, Operations Research Analyst, Ford Motor Company, 2101 Village Road, MD 2122, Dearborn, MI, 48124, United States of America, dreich8@ford.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Jennings, Mary Smith, Michele Plattenberger, Dimitris Bertsimas, Thomas Magnanti, Perry MacNeille, Ryan McGee, Ciro Soto, Joe Rork, Bill Frykman, Susan Curry, Erica Klampfl, Matthew Fontana, Oleg Gusikhin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Battery electric vehicles (BEV) present many new challenges. Among them are limited driving range, long charging time, and highly variable energy consumption patterns. New vehicle electronics features are needed to help drivers make sound decisions: ones that avoid discharged battery situations and extend vehicle range. We are developing an innovative solution that combines traffic simulation, propulsion modeling, and optimization to provide BEV drivers with the best routes for their trips, based on time, travel preferences and energy consumption. By doing so, we aim to improve public confidence in vehicle electrification and achieve the social objectives obtainable through this emerging technology</br>
