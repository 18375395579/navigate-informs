Title: Inventory Record Inaccuracy: Operational Causes and Labor Effects<br>Author: Howard Hao-Chun Chuang, PhD Candidate, Mays Business School at Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843-4217, United States of America, hchuang@mays.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rogelio Oliva<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Inventory record inaccuracy (IRI) can be attributed to shrinkage, misplacement, and transaction errors. We develop a system dynamics model that captures the physics of in-store operations while integrating multiple sources of error. By performing Monte-Carlo simulation, we confirm the conjecture that labor-related errors are roor causes of IRI. We then empirically test the impact of store labor and environments on IRI using Bayesian shrinkage estimation and panel data modeling.
