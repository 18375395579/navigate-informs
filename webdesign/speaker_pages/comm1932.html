Title: Computational Comparisons of Stopping Rules for Stochastic Decomposition (SD)<br>Author: Guzin Bayraksan, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, P.O. Box 210020, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, guzinb@sie.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Binyuan Chen, Suvrajeet Sen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Stochastic decomposition (SD) incorporates sampling-based approximations within the L-shaped method. Current implementations of SD use stopping rules that are guided by bootstrapped (in-sample) duality gap estimates. We develop several other stopping rules using out-of-sample estimates, and compare their performance on several test problems.
