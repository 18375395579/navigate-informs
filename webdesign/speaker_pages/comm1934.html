It proposes an SO technique that uses metamodel information together with a Bayesian framework, where the parameters of the prior distributions are estimated based on probabilistic metamodel information. In order to derive an SO algorithm that achieves a good trade-off between detail, realism and computational efficiency, the metamodel combines information from a highresolution traffic simulator with information from a lower-resolution yet computationally efficient analytical queueing network model. We use this approach to address an urban traffic management problem using a detailed microscopic traffic simulator of the Swiss city of Lausanne.
