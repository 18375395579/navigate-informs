Title: Optimal Multi-voxel Selection in Pattern Classification of Brain Activity<br>Author: Chun-An (Joe) Chou, University of Washington, 3900 Stevens Way, Seattle, WA, United States of America, joechou@uw.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kittipat Bot Kampa, Art Chaovalitwongse<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of pattern classification to identify the brain activity with functional MRI (fMRI) technique. A pattern of multiple voxels distributed in the brain conveys discriminative information for cognitive recognition. In our work, we propose a framework to select a set of voxels by introducing a mutual information theory, which is applied to several linear classifiers. We show the experimental result on a multi-class cognition data set.
