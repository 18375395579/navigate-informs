Title: Improve Power Grid with Controllable Reactance<br>Author: Feng Pan, Los Alamos National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, Los Alamos, NM, 87545, United States of America, fpan@lanl.gov<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In a flexible AC transmission system, line reactance can be adjusted to improve a power grid's performance. We use a linearized DC flow model to approximate power grid. With line reactance being decision variables, a bilevel program is developed to find an optimal setting of reactance on power lines. We discuss solution approaches and  simulation results.
