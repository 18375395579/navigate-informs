Estimating such value functions plays an important role in approximate dynamic programming. We incorporate “soft information?into the estimation algorithm, such as knowledge of convexity, monotonicity, or Lipchitz constants. In the presence of such information, a nonparametric estimator for the value function can be computed that is provably consistent as the simulated time horizon tends to infinity. We also discuss extensions of this idea, and related computational issues.
