Title: A Novel Algorithm for Community Detection and Influence Ranking in Networks<br>Author: Wenjun Wang, University of Iowa, S283 Pappajohn Business Bldg, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, wenjun-wang@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nick Street<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We exploit the implicit knowledge of influence-based connectivity and similarity encoded in network graph topology, and propose a novel algorithm that provides significant insight into community detection and influence analysis. Our approach creatively differentiates the influence ranking in a more meaningful and detailed manner. Experiments on both real-world and simulated networks show the superior performance of our algorithm for community detection.
