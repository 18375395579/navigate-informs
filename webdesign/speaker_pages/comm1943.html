Title: Analysis and Prediction of Aggregate Demand for Electricity<br>Author: John Hobby, Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, NJ, 07974, United States of America, hobby@research.bell-labs.com<br>Coauthor(s): Gabriel Tucci, Mustafa Dogru<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We analyze the aggregate electricity consumption of many consumers, and  extract components for weather and natural illumination.  Least-squares  fits for Steadman apparent temperature and log-scale illumination  proceed independently for each hour of the day.  We use cubic polynomials  and spline surfaces, with FFT spectral analysis for residual  consumption.  We do a full comparison with simpler methods based on  exponential smoothing.
