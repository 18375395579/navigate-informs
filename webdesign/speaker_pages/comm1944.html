<br>Title: Integrated Analytical Performance Evaluation Models of Warehousing Systems</br><br>Author: Manjunath Kamath, Professor, Oklahoma State University, School of Industrial Engr. & Mgmt., 322 EN, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States, m.kamath@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karthik Ayodhiramanujan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop queueing approximations of warehouse operations that can handle features such as planned inventory and limited storage capacity. We present an approximate model of a shared server that stores and retrieves material from a finite capacity rack. We discuss how this shared-server model can be used as a building block to develop comprehensive warehouse performance evaluation models.</br>
