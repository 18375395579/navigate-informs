<br>Title: Scenario Analysis, Policy Evaluation, & Forecasting of Marine Corps Manpower: An Agent-Based Simulation</br><br>Author: Andy Garrick, Operations Analyst, Headquarters Marine Corps, Manpower & Reserve Affairs, 3280 Russell Road, Quantico, VA, 22408, United States of America, twelve12finger@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Marine Corps manpower is a complex, dynamic system seeking continual alignment of requirements and personnel across skill, grade, availability, unit, time, subject to complex constraints. An agent-based simulation model is presented capable of forecasting, scenario analysis, policy evaluation that is timely, accurate, and integrated along relevant dimensions, considering constraints and policy inputs in a single, integrated model. Methodology relevant for wide range of DoD manpower applications.</br>
