<br>Title: To Put a Price on Life: Deriving a Meaningful Threshold for the Cost-Effectiveness of Medicine</br><br>Author: Chris Lee, Assistant Professor of Operations and Information Management, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 500 Jon M. Huntsman Hall, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, cpclee@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Glenn Chertow, Stefanos Zenios</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Cost-effectiveness analysis is often used to evaluate new medical technology for purposes of insurance coverage. The choice of appropriate threshold is critical but most thresholds that are frequently used are unjustifiable on theoretical grounds. We derive a threshold that appeals to the foundations of welfare economics. The method uses an optimization model and tries to uncover from practice patterns the price on life implicitly placed by the society.</br>
