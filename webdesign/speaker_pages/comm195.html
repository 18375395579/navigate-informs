Title: Designing Balancing Mechanisms for Energy Markets using Realistic Customer Models.<br>Author: Konstantina Valogianni, PhD Candidate, Erasmus University, Rotterdam School of Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands, kvalogianni@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Wolf Ketter, Mathijs de Weerdt, John Collins<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present balancing mechanisms for a decentralized and deregulated energy market using controllable customer capacities. We model customers' controllable capacities based on real-world data, since a crucial part for designing precise balancing mechanisms is a realistic customer representation.
