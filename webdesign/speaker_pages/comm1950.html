The vendors of these large contracts include systems integrators, outsourcers, and others. Traditionally vendors pursue large contracts with written proposals and oral demonstrations. A new technique shows great promise: model visioning. Model visioning is the creation of a custom-built business simulation for a big pursuit. The simulation shows decision makers why one’s approach is best.</br>
