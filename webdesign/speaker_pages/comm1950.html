Title: Model Visioning: Business Simulation for Big Pursuits<br>Author: David Bridgeland, Chief Business Architect, Global Business Transformation, Unisys Corporation, 20545 Tidewater Court, Sterling, VA, 20165, United States of America, david.bridgeland@unisys.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Many organizations acquire services via large contracts, contracts of $100 million or more. The vendors of these large contracts include systems integrators, outsourcers, and others. Traditionally vendors pursue large contracts with written proposals and oral demonstrations. A new technique shows great promise: model visioning. Model visioning is the creation of a custom-built business simulation for a big pursuit. The simulation shows decision makers why one’s approach is best.
