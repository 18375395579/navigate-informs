Title: Time to Come Clean? Disclosure and Inspection Policies for Green Production<br>Author: Sang Kim, Associate Professor, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States of America, sang.kim@yale.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine the interplay between two important policies that impact the environmental performance in a production setting: inspections performed by a regulator and noncompliance disclosure by a manufacturing firm. We study this problem by developing a novel analytical framework that combines the features from reliability theory and law enforcement economics. The analysis reveals new insights that counters the established notions.
