Title: An Index Policy for Scheduling Users in a Wireless Cell<br>Author: Nomesh Bolia, UNC Chapel Hill, 210 Smith Bldg, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, nomesh@email.unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vidyadhar Kulkarni<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider resource allocation for data transfer between the base station and users with finite data queues within a cell of a wireless telecommunication network. We derive an index policy that is stable and  attempts to minimize congestion. The index policy is based on a closed form index for every user derived using a policy improvement approach based on Markov Decision Processes. We compare its performance with existing policies through simulation.
