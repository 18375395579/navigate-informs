<br>Title: The Impact of Delay on Risk Preferences</br><br>Author: Ayse Onculer, ESSEC, Ave. Bernard Hirsch, Cergy, FR, 95021, France, onculer@essec.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Enrico Diecidue, Mohammed Abdellaoui</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This study is an elicitation of the probability weighting function over time. By adding a temporal component to probability transformation, we can capture the impact of delay on risk preferences. Our experimental results imply that such a model has a better predictive power than existing models of risky intertemporal choice.</br>
