Title: Strictly Proper Scoring Rules<br>Author: Tilmann Gneiting, University of Washington, Department of Statistics, Seattle, WA, United States, tilmann@stat.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Adrian Raftery<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Scoring rules evaluate probabilistic forecasters, by assigning a numerical score based on the prediction and on the event or value that materializes.  A scoring rule is said to be proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score if she follows her true beliefs in issuing the forecast.  It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique.  This talk reviews the theory of proper scoring rules, gives examples, and closes with a case study on probabilistic forecasts of wind energy resources.
