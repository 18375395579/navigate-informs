Title: A Novel Clustering Approach and Prediction of Optimal Number of Clusters: Global Optimum Search<br>Author: Christodoulos Floudas, Professor, Princeton University, Department of Chemical Engineering, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, floudas@titan.princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Meng Tan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Cluster analysis of genome-wide expression data from DNA microarray hybridization studies is a useful tool for identifying biologically relevant gene groupings. In this study, we describe a novel clustering algorithm framework based on a variant of the Generalized Benders Decom-position, which includes a procedure to determine the optimal number of clusters to be used. We apply our algorithm to experimental DNA microarray data and compare with some commonly-used clustering algorithms.
