In this study, we describe a novel clustering algorithm framework based on a variant of the Generalized Benders Decom-position, which includes a procedure to determine the optimal number of clusters to be used. We apply our algorithm to experimental DNA microarray data and compare with some commonly-used clustering algorithms.</br>
