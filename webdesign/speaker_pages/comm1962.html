<br>Title: Multi-criteria Optimization to Auction Forest Ecosystem Services</br><br>Author: Sandor Toth, College of Forest Resources, University of Washington, Box 352100, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, toths@u.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Greg Ettl, Luke Rogers</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is combined with a novel auction mechanism in this research to evaluate and sell forest ecosystem services.  I will discuss the special features of this auction format and illustrate the bidding process using examples where the production of mature forest habitat, carbon sequestration and viewshed services are considered. I will present preliminary results about a pilot auctioning experiment.</br>
