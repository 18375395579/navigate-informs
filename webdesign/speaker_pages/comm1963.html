Title: Applications of Supersparse Linear Integer Models<br>Author: Stefano Traca, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, stet@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Rudin, Berk Ustun<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Supersparse Linear Integer Models (SLIM) are highly interpretable classification models that only require users to add, subtract and multiply a few meaningful numbers in order to generate a prediction. In this work, we present a collection of interpretable prediction models that are produced using SLIM. Examples include models that can be used to assess the risk of medical outcomes in hospitals, as well as models to predict the incidence of violent crimes for law enforcement.
