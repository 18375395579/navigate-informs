Title: Hierarchical Subset Clustering for Consideration Set Analysis<br>Author: Ding Yuan, The University of Iowa, S210 PBB, Iowa City, IA, 52246, United States, ding-yuan@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nick Street<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consideration sets can be used for market segmentation by grouping customers based on what they considered buying. However, consideration sets are not directly observable in consumer markets. We propose a novel subset clustering algorithm, based on binary clustering and itemset mining, to learn consideration sets from scanner data. In addition to discovering structure in the market, we use clustering to divide the data into homogeneous groups, making for easier choice prediction.
