For the economic evaluation, we perform a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, followed by a real options analysis (ROA) used to determine the value of the utility's flexibility to react to market changes. We investigate both the option to delay the investment and the option to switch power plant operation from cogeneration to power-only mode.</br>
