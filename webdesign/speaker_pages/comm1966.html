Title: Economics of High-temperature Reactors for Industrial Cogeneration: A Utility's Perspective<br>Author: Reinhard Madlener, Professor of Energy Economics and Management, RWTH Aachen University, Mathieustrasse, Aachen, 52074, Germany, RMadlener@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de<br>Coauthor(s): Jona Hampe<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the economics of high-temperature reactors (HTR) for nuclear cogeneration, based on a business model developed from a utility's perspective. For the economic evaluation, we perform a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, followed by a real options analysis (ROA) used to determine the value of the utility's flexibility to react to market changes. We investigate both the option to delay the investment and the option to switch power plant operation from cogeneration to power-only mode.
