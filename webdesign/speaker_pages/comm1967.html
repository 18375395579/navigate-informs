Title: Managing Online Sales: The Simultaneous Use of Posted Price and Open-Bid Auctions<br>Author: Hila Etzion, Assistant Professor of Business Information Technology, University of Michigan, Stephen M. Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, etzionh@bus.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erik Johnston, Scott Moore<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Extending on previous analytical work, an agent-based simulation is used to derive profits from selling consumer goods online using auctions and posted price in parallel. We first validate our simulation by replicating the known analytical results for a dual channel with sealed-bid auctions. The simulation is then used to explore the profitability and design of dual channels with open ascending-bid auctions, when consumers have heterogeneous delay costs and use a variety of bidding strategies.
