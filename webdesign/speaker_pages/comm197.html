Title: Choice Prediction with Consideration Set Clustering<br>Author: Nick Street, Associate Professor, University of Iowa, Dep. of Management Sciences, S232 Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, nick-street@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ding Yuan, Gary Russell<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We previously developed a heuristic subset clustering method that was  used to induce consideration sets, the set of products a customer  considers before a purchase.  In this work we use the resulting market  segmentation as a preprocessing step for choice prediction.  The  resulting simplified choice models identify easy-to-predict segments.
