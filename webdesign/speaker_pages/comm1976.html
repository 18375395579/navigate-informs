Title: Long-term Bank Balance Sheet Management: Estimation and Simulation of Risk-factors<br>Author: Pedro Júdice, Montepio Bank/ISCTE Business School, Rua Teófilo Braga, 17, 7 dto, Coimbra, 3030, Portugal, pedro_judice@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): John Birge<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a dynamic framework which encompasses the main risks in balance sheets of banks. Our contributions include  solving a simple one-period model that describes the optimal bank policy under credit risk, and estimating and simulating the long-term stochastic processes for the balance sheet, taking into account the credit and interest rate cycles and short-term effects. Our results provide a basis for an optimization model to determine bank asset-liability management strategy endogenously.
