<br>Title: Spatial Correlogram-based Dynamic Time Warping for Detection of Defect Patterns in Wafer Maps</br><br>Author: Youngseon Jeong, PhD Student, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Piscataway, NJ, United States of America, yjeong@utk.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seong-Jun Kim, Myong K. (MK) Jeong</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes a new methodology which combines spatial correlogram with dynamic time warping (DTW) for the automatic detection of defect patterns in semiconductor wafer maps. Spatial correlogram is used for the detection of the presence of spatial autocorrelations while DTW distance is adopted for the automatic classification of defect patterns. The experimental results show that our method is robust to random noise, defect location and size.</br>
