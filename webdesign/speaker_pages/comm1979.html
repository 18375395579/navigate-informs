Title: SamsungCard Consumer Lending Model (SCLM)<br>Author: Jaeyung Huh, Ph.D. Senior Manager, Samsung Card Company, 1-7 Yeonji-Dong, Jongro-Gu, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, jaeyung.huh@samsung.com<br>Coauthor(s): Woojin Chang, Jae Yong Lee<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The available credit risk assessment models are inadequate for the risk management for consumer lending business. We introduce a Samsung Card's consumer lending model. In this model we can predict cash flow, estimate the management indices reflecting the obligors' delinquency transition behavior, set a management goal through the analysis of actual business record, evaluate the portfolio responding to the change of firm's lending strategy, and conduct more efficient portfolio management.
