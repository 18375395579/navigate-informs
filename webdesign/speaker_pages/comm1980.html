Title: Using Stochastic Programming to Improve Service Quality in an Outpatient Infusion Center<br>Author: Spyros Potiris, Graduate Student, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, spotiris@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Friese, Autumn Heiney, Brian Denton, Jeremy Castaing, Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Demand for outpatient chemotherapy delivery is rising, resulting in high patient volumes at infusion centers. To reduce patient waiting times and operating hours, we developed a stochastic programming model and easy to implement heuristics to generate patient appointment times at an infusion center. Our models explicitly consider the uncertainty of patient infusion times. We also show a detailed discrete event simulation model to evaluate the performance of the new patient appointment schedules.
