Title: Estimation and Monitoring of Spatial Defect Patterns<br>Author: Matthew Plumlee, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, North Ave., Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, mplumlee@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jianjun Shi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The talk discusses a common scenario where each product is scanned for potential defects and a set of points representing the location of the associated defects is recorded.  While individual defects occur sporadically on a single product, meaningful diagnostic analysis requires estimation of a spatial pattern of defects during production.  Newly developed procedures using functional (nonparametric) statistics are illustrated using production data from a steel rolling mill.
