Title: Synthesizing Wind Data to Integrate into Grid Planning and Policy Making Models<br>Author: Michael Ferris, Professor, University of Wisconsin, Computer Sciences Department, Madison, WI, United States of America, ferris@cs.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Tang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Current operational policies are inadequate to deal with the increasing usage of wind power in the United States. Based on data gathered by NREL of forecasted and realized wind power, we present a framework that integrates statistical methods for modeling dynamics of wind power with economic planning and policy models.
