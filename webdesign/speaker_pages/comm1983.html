<br>Title: Assessing Information Functions of Mobile Retailers: A Zero-truncated Conway-Maxwell Poisson Regress</br><br>Author: Yen-Chun Chou, Assistant Professor, National Chengchi University, No 64 Sec 2 Zhinan Rd, Wenshan District, Taipei, 11605, Taiwan - ROC, yenchunchou.mis@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Howard Hao-Chun Chuang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Our paper presents an empirical analysis of e-retailers?adoption of information functions in mobile retailing. In our attempt to analyze the collected data, we find that the count of information functions exhibits zero-truncation and under-dispersion. To address the two issues, we use a zero-truncated Conway-Maxwell Poisson regression model and find that ignoring under-dispersion not only compromises model fit but also delivers misleading results.</br>
