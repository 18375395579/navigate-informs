Inc. & University of Wisconsin-Madison, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA, 94089, United States, yechen@yahoo-inc.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the security and privacy implications of personal knowledge, especially in the context of social computing. First, we present a non-parametric Bayesian model of knowledge-based authentication. Second, we propose a maximum entropy approach to selecting secure factoids of personal knowledge. Third, we report our empirical results, which are comprised of a pilot study with human subjects and a large-scale experiment with online social networking data.</br>
