<br>Title: Optimal Retail Assortments for the Nested MNL and Other Consumer Choice Models</br><br>Author: Stephen Smith, J. C. Penney Professor, Santa Clara University, OMIS Department, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA, 95053-0382, United States, ssmith@scu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper develops methods for determining optimal retail assortments, given that heterogeneous customers choose products based on the nested multinomial logit model.  Optimal assortments for consumer choice models based on “satisficing?are also derived.   A commercial database of consumer preferences is used to illustrate the optimization methods and to compare the corresponding assortments.</br>
