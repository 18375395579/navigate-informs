<br>Title: Approximate MVA for Closed Queueing Networks with Multiple-Server Stations and General Service Times</br><br>Author: Rajan Suri, Professor, Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, 53726, United States, suri@engr.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mary Vernon, Sushanta Sahu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Closed Queueing Networks are used in modeling systems such as FMS, CONWIP, health care, and computer systems. Mean Value Analysis (MVA) is often used to compute the performance measures for these models. The Schweitzer-Bard (S-B) approximation improves the computational efficiency of MVA for single-server stations. We provide a simple extension to S-B MVA to enable the analysis of multiple-server stations. We then extend the model for general service time distributions.</br>
