We first capture the price path of auctions via a novel parametric Beta model and then measure the distance between neighboring price paths using the Kullback-Leibler distance. Our KNN methods incorporates a mixture of functional and non-functional and improves the prediction accuracy compared to a series of competitor models.</br>
