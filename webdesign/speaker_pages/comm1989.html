Title: Auction Forecasting via Functional KNN<br>Author: Shu Zhang, PhD student, Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computation Program, University of Maryland, Mathematics Dept., Univ. of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, zhangshu01@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Wolfgang Jank, Galit Shmueli<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a functional K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method to predict prices in online auctions. We first capture the price path of auctions via a novel parametric Beta model and then measure the distance between neighboring price paths using the Kullback-Leibler distance. Our KNN methods incorporates a mixture of functional and non-functional and improves the prediction accuracy compared to a series of competitor models.
