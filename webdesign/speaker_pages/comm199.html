Title: Surface Variation Modeling for Establishing Cyber-physical Systems in Surface Manufacturing<br>Author: Hui Wang, Research Scientist, The University of Michigan, 2350 Hayward St., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, huiwz@umich.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This talk presents a framework of surface variation modeling for high-precision surface variation control. The proposed methodology fuses the multidisciplinary information from a number of cyber-physical elements in a multistage surface machining process, thereby characterizing the surface variation in interpretable ways. The surface models will enable joint decision making for establishing cyber-physical systems in surface manufacturing.
