Title: The Concept of Shadow Price to Monetarize the Intangible Value of Expertise<br>Author: Emmanuel Fragniere, Professor, Haute Ecole de Gestion of Geneva, 7 route de Drize, Carouge, Ge, 1227, Switzerland, emmanuel.fragniere@hesge.ch<br>Coauthor(s): Joelle Debely, Magali Dubosson, Francesco Moresino<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The pricing of knowledge based services should be based on the 3 following components: the cost structure, the competition and the perceived value by the client. Practically, it is mainly based on the cost structure which does not account the real value provided to the client. Based on an integrated optimization model combining an aggregate planning model with a share of choice model, we produce implicit values of expertise.  Preliminary results will be presented about a travel agency.
