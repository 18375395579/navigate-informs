Several risk models are used by clinicians to guide diabetes related treatment decisions.We examine an important treatment decision, the optimal start time of statins, using a Markov decision process (MDP) model. Our MDP model indicates that significant discrepancies among alternative risk models translate into significant differences in the implied optimal time to start treatment with statins.</br>
