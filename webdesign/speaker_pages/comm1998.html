<br>Title: Assessing Extreme Loads on Wind Turbines by using Aerodynamic Simulation</br><br>Author: Eunshin Byon, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States of America, ebyon@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Youngjun Choe</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a new methodology to predict an extreme load on a wind turbine by employing high-fidelity simulation. Due to a small probability of extreme events, crude Monte Carlo simulation requires extensive runs, which is computationally prohibitive.   We devise an efficient sampling method to guide the simulation to generate the extreme events more frequently with minimal efforts.  The proposed method is applied to an aerodynamic simulation.</br>
