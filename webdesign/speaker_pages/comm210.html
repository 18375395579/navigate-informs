Title: Facets for Flow Models with Cardinality Constraints From Multidimensional Superadditive Lifting<br>Author: Bo Zeng, Purdue University, Industrial Engineering, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States, bzeng@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk, we perform a polyhedral study of the single node flow model with cardinality constraints. We first derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which several flow cover inequalities are facet-defining. Then, we derive strong multidimensional superadditive approximations for their lifting functions. We describe the lifted flow cover inequalities obtained using this procedure and compare them to those obtained by Louveaux and Wolsey for the single node flow model with GUBs.
