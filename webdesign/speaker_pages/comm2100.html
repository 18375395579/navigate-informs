Title: A Fast Sub-gradient Descent Approach for Sparse Inverse Covariance Selection Model<br>Author: Yuqi Sun, Industrial and Manufacturing system Engineering, the Pennsylvania State University, 240 Leonhard, University Park, United States of America, yus139@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hongcheng Liu, Ke Han, Tao Yao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a fast sub-gradient descent method with flexible step size to solve a maximum likelihood problem with l_1-norm penalty. By proving the strongly convexity of the primal problem, our proposed method yields an O(log(1/epsilon)) iteration complexity. By reducing per-iteration cost, this method can significantly reduce the computational efforts compared with existing approaches.
