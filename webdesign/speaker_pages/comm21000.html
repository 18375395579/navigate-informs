These are used to show that integer infinite group problems have discontinuous extreme inequalities, giving insight into unusual types of cuts that may be computationally important. We present connections between finite and infinite group problems and give results about converging sequence of extreme inequalities. Finally, we prove that extreme inequalities for mixed integer programs are always continuous.
