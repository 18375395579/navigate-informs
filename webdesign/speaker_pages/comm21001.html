Title: Stochastic Scheduling for Cloud Computing<br>Author: Laurent Pauwels, The University of Sydney, Rm 481, Merewether Building, Sydney, Australia, laurent.pauwels@sydney.edu.au<br>Coauthor(s): Dmytro Matsypura<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a scheduling problem of a software-as-a-service provider (cloud user). The provider has access to virtually unlimited computing resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. The jobs that need to be scheduled have uncertain sizes and completion times. We present stochastic program formulations with respect to various measures of optimality, investigate structural properties of optimal solutions and analyze worst-case performance of various heuristics.
