Title: Uncapacitated Lot-Sizing with Backlogging: The Convex Hull<br>Author: Simge Kucukyavuz, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, Systems and Industrial Engineering, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, simge@sie.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yves Pochet<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk, we give facets of the uncapacitated lot-sizing polyhedron with backlogging that subsume all known inequalities for this polyhedron. We show that these inequalities are enough to give the convex hull of solutions. We give an efficient combinatorial separation algorithm for an important special case. Finally, we summarize our computational results.
