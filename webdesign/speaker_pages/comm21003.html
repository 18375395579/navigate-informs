Title: Approaches to Solving the AC Optimal Power Flow and Implications for Future Research<br>Author: Anya Castillo, PhD Candidate, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 North Charles Street, Ames Hall 313, Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States of America, anya.castillo@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Richard O'Neill<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Computational advancements are enabling RTOs/ ISOs to adopt more efficient market design. Even 50 years after developing the ACOPF, we still do not have fast and robust approaches to co-optimize real and reactive power, or to determine losses endogenously in the real markets. A 1% improvement in security constrained dispatch saves roughly 1-5 billion USD per year in the US. We present our current work on ACOPF solution techniques and discuss challenges in developing better methods and software.
