While the original implementation only uses local information of the solution to be cut off, our approach generates optimality cuts based on the information provided by all feasible solutions visited so far at a given step of the method. In developing this approach, we prove the tractability of describing the convex hull of all binary vectors except a list of forbidden vectors.</br>
