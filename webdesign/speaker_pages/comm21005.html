Title: Toll Policies for Mitigating Hazardous Materials Transport Risk<br>Author: Anne Mercier, CRT, Universit?de Montréal, C.P. 6128, Succursale Centre-ville, Montréal, Canada, anne.mercier@gerad.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Patrice Marcotte, Gilles Savard, Vedat Verter<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose toll setting as an alternative policy tool to regulate the use of roads for dangerous goods shipments. We propose a bilevel programming formulation as well as a solution method. Based on a comparative analysis, we show that toll policies can be more effective than network design policies that identify road segments to be closed. We present a summary of computational experiments on a problem instance from Western Ontario, Canada.
