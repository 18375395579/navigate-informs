<br>Title: On the Matrix Rank of Even-Order Tensors and Its Application in Low-Rank Tensor Optimization</br><br>Author: Bo Jiang, Ph.D. student, ISyE, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street SE, Minneapolis, United States of America, jiang373@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shiqian Ma, Shuzhong Zhang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we propose to unfold an even-order tensor into a matrix, whose row index is formed by one half of the indices of the tensor and column index is formed by the other half. The rank of the resulting matrix has many interesting properties. For instance, the original tensor rank can be both lower and upper bounded by the matrix rank multiplied by a constant depending on dimension n. Our numerical results show that this matrix rank is useful in low-rank tensor optimization problems.</br>
