Title: A Decomposition Approach for the Stochastic ATFM Problem<br>Author: Luca Corolli, University of Milano-Bicocca, Dept. Informatics Systems Communication, Milano, 20126, Italy, luca.corolli@disco.unimib.it<br>Coauthor(s): Lewis Ntaimo, Guglielmo Lulli<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The stochastic Air traffic Flow Management (ATFM) problem is now attracting a lot of interest from the research community. In this talk, we present a two-stage stochastic integer programming formulation for the problem, which balance the trade-off between the complexity of the model and its representation of reality. To solve the problem, we present a decomposition approach to take advantage of the underlying structure of the problem.
