Title: Multi-floor Facility Layout Technique with Location Matrix<br>Author: Takashi Irohara, Associate Professor, Sophia University, 7-1 Kipi-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 1028554, Japan, irohara@sophia.ac.jp<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this paper, a new layout design methodology was proposed, in which detailed locations of departments and ELVs can be decided simultaneously, by using the integrated approach of combinatorial optimization and mathematical programming approaches. In addition, it is also considered to select the ELV used in each pair of departments in different floors.
