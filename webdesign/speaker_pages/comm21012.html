The proposed framework incorporates local/gradient search into the global randomized search. Moreover, this framework provides a unifying view at three randomized methods for optimization: estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), the cross-entropy (CE) method, and model reference adaptive search (MRAS). It also sheds light on developing new optimization algorithms.</br>
