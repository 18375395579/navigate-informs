Title: Expected Utility and Narrow Bracketing<br>Author: Manel Baucells, Professor, Rand Corporation, 1776 Main St., Santa Monica, CA, 90407, United States of America, mbaucells@gmail.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Subjects have a strong tendency to engage in narrow bracketing. In the context of prescriptive utility theory, we examine utility functions that are robust to narrow bracketing: Even when solving each period’s problem in isolation we still produce the optimal solution to the multi-period problem. We characterize the class of utility functions that are robust to narrow bracketing in three decision environments, namely, stationary, probabilistically independent, and probabilistically dependent.
