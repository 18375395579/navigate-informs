Title: Practically Efficient Separations for Edge-failure Resilient Network Design<br>Author: Richard Chen, Quantitative Modeling and Analysis, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, United States of America, rlchen@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Phillips<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a multicommodity network subject to edge-failure resiliency criterion. We present MILP formulations, valid inequalities and compact separation problems that avoid exhaustive searches over the exponential number of failure scenarios. Empirical studies on previously unsolved instances of SNDlib demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
