Title: Some Properties of Convex Hulls of Integer Points Contained in General Convex Sets<br>Author: Santanu Dey, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, santanu.dey@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Diego Moran<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present properties of general closed convex sets that determine the closed-ness and polyhedrality of the convex hull of integer points contained in it. The necessary and sufficient conditions for closed-ness leads to useful results for special class of convex sets like pointed cones, strictly convex sets, and sets containing integer points in their interior. The sufficient conditions for the convex hull of integer points to be polyhedron are shown to be necessary under a simple condition.
