We present an acceleration technique for solving two-stage robust unit commitment models by dynamically including critical transmission line constraints. Computational results for the modified IEEE-118 bus system show that the proposed cutting-plane algorithm improves the solution speed, but the column-generation algorithm is not effective.</br>
