Title: Distributed Optimization in Stochastic Networks<br>Author: Ilan Lobel, 77 Massachusetts avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, lobel@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Asu Ozdaglar<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the problem of computing distributedly the minimum of a sum of non-smooth convex functions in a network where communication links fail according to a stochastic process. We show that a consensus-based algorithm coupled with a subgradient method converges to the optimal for i.i.d. stochastic networks and in networks where communication probability is dependent on the optimization solution.
