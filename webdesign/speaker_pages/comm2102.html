<br>Title: Pricing Non-convexities in an Electricity Pool</br><br>Author: Carlos Ruiz, École Centrale Paris and Supélec, Grande Voie des Vignes, Châtenay-Malabry, 92295, France, carlosruizmora@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antonio Conejo, Steven Gabriel</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Electricity pools are generally cleared through auctions formulated as non-convex MILP problems that make difficult the derivation of adequate marginal prices.  In this work we propose a primal-dual approach to derive efficient revenue adequate uniform prices that guarantee that dispatched producers are willing to remain in the market. Such prices may not significantly deviate from the marginal prices obtained if integrality conditions are relaxed in the original MILP problem.</br>
