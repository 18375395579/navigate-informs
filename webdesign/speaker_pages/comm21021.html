Based on the corresponding pseudo-Boolean polynomial of the SPLP we derive the most compact  MILP  model for the SPLP and its variations. Our computational study of the MILP model for the SPLP and its variations shows that many large sized SPLP type instances are solved exactly by means of a general purpose solver like Cplex.</br>
