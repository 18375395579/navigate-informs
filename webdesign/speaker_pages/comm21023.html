However, its effectiveness has not been matched by a provably fast rate of convergence. We establish its global linear convergence under various scenarios and allow the subproblems to be solved faster and less exactly in certain manners. The analysis also provides some theoretical guidance for optimizing the ADM parameters.</br>
