Title: From Cvar to Uncertainty Set: Implications in Joint Chance Constrained Optimization<br>Author: Melvyn Sim, Professor, NUS Business School, Singapore, dscsimm@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Chung-Piaw Teo, Jie Sun, Wenqing Chen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper we review the different tractable approximations of individual chance constraint problems using robust optimization on a varieties of uncertainty set, and show their interesting connections with bounds on the condition-value-at-risk CVaR. We also propose a new formulation for approximating joint chance constrained problems, which builds on a classical worst case bound for order statistics problem.
