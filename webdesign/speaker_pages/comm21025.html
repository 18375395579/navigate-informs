Title: Two-stage Portfolio Optimization with Higher-order Conditional Measures of Risk<br>Author: Sitki Gulten, PhD Candidate, Rutgers University, Management Science & Inf. Systems, 1 Washington Park, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, sgulten@business.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrzej Ruszczynski<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We describe a study of novel risk modeling and optimization techniques to daily portfolio management. First, we develop and compare specialized methods for scenario generation and scenario tree construction. Second, we construct a two-stage stochastic programming problem with conditional measures of risk, which is used to re-balance the portfolio on a rolling horizon basis, transaction costs included in the model. Third, we present an extensive simulation study on real-world data.
