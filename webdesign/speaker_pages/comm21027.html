<br>Title: Fractional Multiple-ratio Combinatorial Optimization on Graphs</br><br>Author: Oleksii Ursulenko, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, United States of America, ursul@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sergiy Butenko, Oleg Prokopyev</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider fractional programming problems such as Minimum Multiple-Ratio Spanning Tree, Minimum Multiple-Ratio Shortest Path and Minimum Multiple-Ratio Shortest Cycle, which extend classical combinatorial optimization problems to the case of a sum-of-ratios objective function. Complexity results, a global optimization framework for this type of problems, and computational results are presented.</br>
