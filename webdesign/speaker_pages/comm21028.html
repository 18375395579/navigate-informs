The problem is NP-hard implying the need for lower bounds. A lower bound based on the idea of the branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed. A branching strategy superior to the conventional branching in B&P is proposed.  Nevertheless, the sub problems are NP-hard and several properties on the contribution of the sub problems are proposed.</br>
