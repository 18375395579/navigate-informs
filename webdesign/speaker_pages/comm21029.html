Title: Optimal Placement of Multiple Types of Detectors under a Small Vessel Attack Threat to Port Security<br>Author: Xiaofeng Nie, Assistant Professor, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, 639798, Singapore, xiaofengnie@ntu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Xihong Yan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Because of the strategic importance, ports are potential terrorist targets. We focus on the threat scenario where the terrorists would use small vessels as waterborne improvised explosive devices to attack maritime targets. We consider how to locate multiple types of detectors such that the expected damage cost is minimized. The model is formulated as a nonlinear binary integer program and some exact and heuristic algorithms are proposed.
