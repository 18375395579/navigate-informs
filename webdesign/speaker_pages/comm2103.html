<br>Title: A Differential Variational Inequality Formulation for Rigid Body Dynamics with Polyhedral Bodies</br><br>Author: Gary Hart, University of Pittsburgh, 301 Thackeray Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, gdhart@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mihai Anitescu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a differential variational inequality formulation for rigid body dynamics with polyhedral bodies. The formulation is based on a novel measure for depth of penetration between polyhedral bodies that has a linear complexity. Numerical results show that a time-stepping approach based on this formulation achieves constraint stabilization for fixed time steps.</br>
