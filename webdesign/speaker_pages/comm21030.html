Title: Production Scheduling with Two-modal Transportation Consideration<br>Author: Feng Li, Northeastern University, The Logistics Institute, Shenyang, 110004, China, fli@tli.neu.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Zhi-Long Chen, Lixin Tang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by application in the steel industry, we study an integrated scheduling model of production and two-modal transportation. A set of jobs are first processed in a processing facility, then delivered to the port  by trucks, and finally delivered to the customers by ships.  We study various classes of problems. For each of the problems studied, we provide an efficient exact algorithm or a proof intractability accompanied by a heuristic algorithm with worst case analysis.
