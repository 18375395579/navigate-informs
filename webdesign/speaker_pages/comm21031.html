Title: A Constructive Approach for Multidimensional Superadditive Lifting<br>Author: Bo Zeng, PhD Candidate, Purdue University, 223 Arnold Drive, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, bzeng@ecn.purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Lifted cuts from single constraint of 0-1 MIPs have been proven to be very effective. We present a framework to efficiently and systematically build superadditive approximation of higher dimensional lifting function from the superadditive approximation of lower dimensional one. This framework can be used to generate cuts based on multiple constraints. Applications on several variations of classical knapsack and single node flow problems as well as 2-D knapsack problem will be presented.
