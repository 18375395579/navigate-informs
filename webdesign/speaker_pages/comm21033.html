<br>Title: Optimal Design and Augmentation of Strongly Attack-Tolerant Two-Hop clusters in Directed Networks</br><br>Author: Grigory Pastukhov, PhD student, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, gpastukhov@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eduardo Pasiliao, Vladimir Boginski, Alexander Veremyev</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problems of minimum-cost design and augmentation of directed network clusters that have diameter 2 and maintain the same diameter after the deletion of up to R nodes and/or arcs anywhere in a cluster. We present provably tight theoretical bounds and a heuristic algorithm for the considered class of problems. Computational experiments suggest that the proposed heuristic does identify high-quality near-optimal solutions.</br>
