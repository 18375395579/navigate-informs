Dantzig’s Contributions to Integer Programming</br><br>Author: Ellis Johnson, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, ellis.johnson@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss Dantzig’s lesser known  seminal contributions to integer programming. His joint TSP paper (with Fulkerson &  Johnson) pointed the way to several approaches to solving IP problems. We give some historical perspective, details of what was in the paper, and how those methods opened up rich areas of research including: solving the TSP; combinatorial optimization more generally; separation methods for cut generation in integer programming; and combining linear programming and enumeration.</br>
