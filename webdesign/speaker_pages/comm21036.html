<br>Title: A Framework to Determine Critical Links of an Intercity Rail Network for Pre-disaster Infrastructure</br><br>Author: Yoonjin Yoon, Assistant Professor, KAIST, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-701, Korea, Republic of, yoonjin@kaist.ac.kr</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In the study, an existing tree-search algorithm to efficiently enumerate potential network states is extended to the Link-based Categorization of Network States (LCNS). This procedure categorizes each newly enumerated network state depending on its coincidence with any specific link’s degradation. A computational experiment was conducted on a real-world intercity rail network, which reveals that proposed method effectively determines critical links, particularly for disastrous scenarios.</br>
