Title: The Profit Curve for Budgeted Learning: Properties and  Computation<br>Author: Brad Null, Stanford University, null@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the budgeted learning problem we experiment on a set of alternatives   (given a fixed experimentation budget) with the goal of picking a single alternative with the largest   possible expected payoff. The ratio index, introduced by Goel et al. [5], leads to an index-based constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem. Index-based policies have the advantage that a single number (i.e. the index) can be computed for each alternative irrespective of all other alternatives, and the alternative with the highest index is experimented upon. This value has been highlighted by the famous Gittins index for the discounted multi-armed bandit problem. In this paper, we define the profit curve for budgeted learning, which is critical to calculating the ratio index. In the process, we derive several structural properties for the  profit curve with significant consequences. Among these properties, we show that the profit curve is concave and piecewise linear, which, among other things, makes calculation of the ratio index using the profit curve elementary. We also show that the policies which induce the profit curve possess a certain monotonicity property critical to the proof that a greedy algorithm for budgeted learning with respect to the ratio index is a constant factor approximation algorithm. This monotonicity property also leads directly to a proof that the profit curve and the ratio index can be computed in strongly polynomial time. Thus, the greedy algorithm can be executed in strongly polynomial time, as can an index-based approximation algorithm for a discount oblivious version of the multi-armed bandit problem. Further, the techniques we develop may also be useful for deriving strongly polynomial algorithms for other Markov Decision Problems. We conclude with a detailed algorithm for computing the profit curve.
