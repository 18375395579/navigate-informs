Title: Airport Ground Staff Optimization<br>Author: Peng Duan, Senior Operations Research Developer, Sabre Holdings, Suite 2206, Maxdo Center, No. 8 Xing Yi Road, Shanghai, 200336, China, peng.duan@sabre.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Traditionally the airport ground staff rostering problem is usually carried out in several stages and built upon aggregate demand. In this work, we present an integrated solution approach working with disaggregate tasks. The solution approach includes a heuristic and a post optimization algorithm. We discuss the integration of shift assignment stage and task assignment stage, and how different running modes and complex business rules are handled.
