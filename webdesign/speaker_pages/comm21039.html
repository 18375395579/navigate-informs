The researchers are increasingly relying on computational techniques to classify these sequences into functional and structural families based on sequence homology. String kernel methods with SVMs are a powerful approach to protein sequence classification. In this talk, we introduce a unified kernel for use with support vector machines in a discriminative approach to the protein classification problem.</br>
