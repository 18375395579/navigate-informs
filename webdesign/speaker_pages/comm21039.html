Title: A Unified String Kernel for Biological Sequences<br>Author: Altannar Chinchuluun, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, ISE Dept., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, altannar@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Pardalos<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The analysis of protein sequences becomes one of the most successful areas in bioinformatics. The researchers are increasingly relying on computational techniques to classify these sequences into functional and structural families based on sequence homology. String kernel methods with SVMs are a powerful approach to protein sequence classification. In this talk, we introduce a unified kernel for use with support vector machines in a discriminative approach to the protein classification problem.
