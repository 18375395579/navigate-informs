Simple ECCs have been used successfully to significantly reduce the duality gap of combinatorial optimization problems like the Capacitated MST, but can be applied to other important problems like vehicle routing and machine scheduling. We perform exact separation of ECCs and a variation called path-ECCs based on a result by Dash et al.. Computational results are presented</br>
