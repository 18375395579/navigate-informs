Title: Decentralized Charging Scheduling for Electric Vehicles Using Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming<br>Author: Dzung Phan, Research Staff Member, IBM T.J.

Our model introduces three characteristics to this problem: capacity constraints on the distribution grid, fair rationing of energy supply available under the capacity constraint, and discrete choice of EV charger settings. We study a distributed scheme based on the homotopy technique, which is able to efficiently solve the MINLP formulation.
