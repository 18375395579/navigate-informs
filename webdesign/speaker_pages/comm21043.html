We developed constraints that realistically mimic wildfire suppression activities, which can be used within a stochastic programming formulation that models fire spread and intensity. Solutions to the model suggest optimal suppression activities for a known ignition given a probability distribution of random weather scenarios. The formulation is designed to handle multi-objective fire policies where portions of a fire may be allowed to spread and other portions are contained.
