<br>Title: Wildfire Suppression Constraints Within A Stochastic Integer Programming Fire Spread Model</br><br>Author: Erin Belval, Colorado State University, Campus Delivery 1472, Fort Collins, CO, 80523, United States of America, mccowene@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mike Bevers, Yu Wei</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Assigning wildfire suppression resources safely and efficiently is a complex task. We developed constraints that realistically mimic wildfire suppression activities, which can be used within a stochastic programming formulation that models fire spread and intensity. Solutions to the model suggest optimal suppression activities for a known ignition given a probability distribution of random weather scenarios. The formulation is designed to handle multi-objective fire policies where portions of a fire may be allowed to spread and other portions are contained.</br>
