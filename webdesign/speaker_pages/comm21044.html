Title: Semi-Open Queuing Network Applications in Logistics<br>Author: Sunderesh Heragu, Department of Industrial Engineering, J.B. Speed School of Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, 40292, United States, s.heragu@louisville.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jing Jia<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper, we illustrate applications for semi-open queuing network models in manufacturing and logistics. We solve some special cases of this model exactly using analytical matrix genometric methods and develop heuristic solution methods for others.
