<br>Title: A Comparison of Approaches for Solving the Product Family Platform Selection and Design Problem</br><br>Author: Aida Khajavirad, Graduate Student, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave., Hamerschlag Hall B129, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, aida@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeremy Michalek</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: An important challenge in product development is to design a set of products that target distinct market segments while maximizing component sharing to reduce manufacturing cost. This joint platform-selection and design problem is a large-scale nonconvex MINLP. We propose and compare several approaches to solving the joint problem, including a heuristic NLP, a decomposed genetic algorithm, and a deterministic global optimization approach using branch-and-reduce with Lagrangian decomposition.</br>
