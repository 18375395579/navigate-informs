Title: On Path Marginal Cost Analysis and Its Implications to Dynamic Congestion Pricing<br>Author: Wei Shen, Ph.D Candidate, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Davis, 1001 EUIII, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA, 95616, United States, wshen@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yu (Marco) Nie, Michael Zhang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Dynamic congestion pricing relies on the path marginal cost information, which represents the gradient of the objective function in the system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment problem. We reveal a critical deficiency in existing path marginal cost evaluation methods, and subsequently develop a new method by tracing the propagations of a path flow perturbation. A solution algorithm that incorporates this new method for solving the path-based SO-DTA problem is also designed and tested.
