<br>Title: An Excel Add-In For Solving Linear and Nonlinear Optimization Problems With Multiple Objectives</br><br>Author: Patrick Mackin, Associate Professor, Black Hills State University, 1200 University, Spearfish, SD, 57779, United States, patrickmackin@rap.midco.net</br><br>Coauthor(s): Asim Roy, Jyrki Wallenius</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Single objective linear and nonlinear optimization problems can be solved within a spreadsheet system like Excel. However, many decision problems have multiple, conflicting objectives and there are no user-friendly commercial systems available to solve them. In this paper we present an add-in for Excel for solving this class of problems. The system is an implementation of an interactive method that we developed that is based on a Q/A session with the user that asks relatively simple questions.</br>
