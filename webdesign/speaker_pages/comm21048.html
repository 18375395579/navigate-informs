Using known traffic statistics, we optimally control the sleep interval between consecutive wake-ups of the receiver. We derive necessary conditions for optimality and propose an explicit solution algorithm. When statistics are unknown, we use an iterative scheme to estimate them and provide a second algorithm.  Simulation shows the optimal policy dominating the best fixed sleep time control.
