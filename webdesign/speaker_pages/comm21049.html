<br>Title: Winner Determination Under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Roy H. Kwon, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, rkwon@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the winner determination problem under uncertainty for combinatorial auctions. The WD problem under uncertainty is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic integer program. We present both approximation heuristics with worst-case guarantees as well as a novel exact approach based on dual decomposition and column   generation.</br>
