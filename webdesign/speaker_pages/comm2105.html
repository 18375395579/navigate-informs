Title: Exact Analysis of the M/M/2 with Setup Times and other Hard Variants<br>Author: Anshul Gandhi, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, anshulg@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Scheller-Wolf, Mor Harchol-Balter, Sherwin Doroudi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many classic queueing problems have a simple Markov chain representation, yet solving this Markov chain is very difficult. An example is the M/M/2/Setup system where there is a setup time to turn a server on. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to analyze Markov chains that works by combining ideas from renewal reward theory and busy period analysis. We demonstrate this technique by solving the M/M/2/Setup and other similarly difficult variants.
