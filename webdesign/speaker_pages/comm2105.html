An example is the M/M/2/Setup system where there is a setup time to turn a server on. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to analyze Markov chains that works by combining ideas from renewal reward theory and busy period analysis. We demonstrate this technique by solving the M/M/2/Setup and other similarly difficult variants.</br>
