The Limits of Spreadsheet Modeling</br><br>Author: John Raffensperger, Senior Lecturer, University of Canterbury, Private Bag 4800, Department of Management, Christchurch, 8140, New Zealand, john.raffensperger@canterbury.ac.nz</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The min spanning tree is an easy problem, but solution in Excel is annoying. We can make an MST by a macro with a standard algorithm, or with an LP in Solver with subtour rows. Without macros or Solver, I give a spreadsheet to find an MST, and also Held-Karp subgradient optimization for the TSP. With constructive complexity analysis, I show Excel is sufficiently expressive for these models, but they would be easier to write in procedural code. This points to the limits of spreadsheet modeling.</br>
