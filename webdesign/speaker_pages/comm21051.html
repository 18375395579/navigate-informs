The algorithm applies to any CCMP in which the random constraints are polyhedra, and hence includes the difficult cases of linear constraints with random coefficients and models with the opportunity to restore feasibility with recourse actions. The algorithm benefits from decomposition by scenario and the use of strong valid inequalities. Encouraging computational results are presented.</br>
