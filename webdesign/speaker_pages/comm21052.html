Title: Optimal and Heuristic Procedures for the Placement of Two Finite-size Facilities in a Planar Layout<br>Author: Ketan Date, PhD Student, University at Buffalo, 438 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, ketandat@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shailesh Darekar, Rakesh Nagi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this work, we propose a new lower bounding procedure for the optimal placement of the two finite-size facilities, which can effectively eliminate sub-optimal candidates, resulting in faster convergence. We also study some heuristic procedures and conduct extensive numerical comparison with the optimal procedure, in terms of solution quality and computing time.
