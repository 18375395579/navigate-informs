A variety of   issues arise when implementing PH in practice. We investigate these issues in the context of a large-scale, real-world stochastic   mixed-integer problems. We introduce a mathematically-based heuristic for setting the algorithm parameter,   methods for detecting convergence, and novel techniques for convergence acceleration.</br>
