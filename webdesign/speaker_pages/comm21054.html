Title: New Heuristics for Revenue Management Problem under Choice Models<br>Author: Lin Li, Ph.D student, Columbia University, ll2053@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Ratliff, Guillermo Gallego<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present near optimal heuristics for the single leg multiple fare Revenue Management problem where demand for different fare classes is driven by a choice model. The heuristic is designed for the case where the efficient sets are nested. Extension to parallel flights will also be discussed.
