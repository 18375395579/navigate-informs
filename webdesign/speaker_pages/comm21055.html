We consider a family of sequential stochastic optimization problems in which the underlying objective function may exhibit a broad array of temporal changes. Our main results lead to  a mapping from budget of variation to achievable performance. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-principle for constructing rate-optimal policies in various settings.</br>
