Title: Provably Near-optimal Solutions for Very Large Single-row Facility Layout Problems<br>Author: Miguel Anjos, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L3G1, Canada, manjos@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Ginger Yen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The single-row facility layout problem is concerned with the optimal arrangement of rectangular facilities along a line. Recently, the combination of a semidefinite programming relaxation with cutting planes computed globally optimal layouts for SRFLPs with up to 30 facilities. We propose a new semidefinite programming relaxation with a reduced number of linear constraints, and use it to compute nearly-optimal solutions for instances with up to 100 facilities.
