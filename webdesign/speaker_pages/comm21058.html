Title: Multiperiod Portfolio Optimization with Cone Constraints and  Discrete Decisions<br>Author: Umit Saglam, Ph.D. Candidate, LeBow College of Business, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, us26@drexel.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hande Benson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a portfolio optimization problem where the investor’s objective is to choose a trading strategy that maximizes expected return penalized by transaction costs. We include portfolio diversification constraints in our single and multiperiod models. The overall problem is a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem, which we solve with the Matlab-based solver MILANO. This talk will focus on the solution and warm-start of the second-order cone programming subproblems.
