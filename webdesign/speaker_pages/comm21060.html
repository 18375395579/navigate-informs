Title: A Robust CVaR Optimization Approach to Left-sided Breast Cancer Radiation Therapy<br>Author: Houra Mahmoudzadeh, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, houra@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Chan, Thomas Purdie<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a robust-CVaR approach to the breast cancer IMRT problem that enables high quality treatments and is applicable for all patients.  Our model guarantees the clinical limits on the organs hold under uncertainty in the breathing pattern. We first solve the problem with the standard robust optimization reformulation using duality theory, and next propose a constraint generation method based on the special structure of the problem.
