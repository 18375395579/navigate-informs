Title: An Automated Planning Engine for Biopharmaceutical Production<br>Author: Rob Leachman, Professor, University of Calif. at Berkeley, 4127 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1777, United States of America, leachman@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This optimization-based production planning system generates capacity-feasible batch processing schedules for the facilities in a biomanufacturing supply chain and an availability schedule for finished product against given demands. It precisely reflects constraints imposed by regulatory approvals, outcomes of quality testing and processing options. Problems with 30,000 binary variables, 150,000 linear variables and 90,000 constraints are automatically formulated and solved within several hours.
