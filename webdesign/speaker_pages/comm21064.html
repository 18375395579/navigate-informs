Title: On the Complexity and Solution of Inverse Mixed Integer Linear Programs<br>Author: Aykut Bulut, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Avenue, BETHLEHEM, PA, 18015, United States of America, ayb211@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Inverse optimization problem is that of determining values of the parameters of an optimization problem that will make a given solution optimal and that are closest to a given set of nominal values. We consider an inverse MILP in which the parameters to be varied are objective function coefficients. We discuss the complexity of this problem and propose a framework for solving it. We study the effect of problem parameters and other properties of the instance and class on practical running times.
