Under suitable assumptions, we establish that any limit point of the sequence generated by the PD methods satisfies the first-order optimality conditions of the problems. Furthermore, for the problems in which the $l_0$ part is the only nonconvex part, we show that such a limit point is a local minimizer. Computational results show that our methods generally outperform the existing methods.</br>
