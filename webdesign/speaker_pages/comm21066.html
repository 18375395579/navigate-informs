Title: Efficient Frontier in Investment Portfolio<br>Author: Peter Nieuwesteeg, Senior AIMMS specialist, AIMMS (Paragon Decision Technology), 5400 Carillon Point, Kirkland, WA, 98033, United States of America, Peter.Nieuwesteeg@aimms.com<br>Coauthor(s): Sriram Vasantharajan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: “The optimal solution?is not always the right choice when making an investment decision. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze multiple “optimal?solutions. We will show how the AIMMS modeling system uses the CPLEX solution pool to obtain multiple solutions in this oil investment portfolio example from Optimal Decisions. Besides obtaining these solutions, we will also demonstrate AIMMS functionality to show an efficient frontier, as well as the case comparison functionality.
