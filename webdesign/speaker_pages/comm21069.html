Title: A Branch and Cut Algorithm for Solving Capacitated Max K-Cut with an Application in Scheduling<br>Author: Matthew Oster, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, osterm38@eden.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Eckstein<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We model the scheduling of a symmetric multi-track conference as a capacitated version of Maximum K-Cut (MKC). We solve this NP-hard problem to optimality within a branch-and-bound framework equipped with a semidefinite programming relaxation of MKC, enhanced with triangle and clique cuts, as well as problem-specific cuts (e.g. capacity cuts). We introduce a heuristic for generating feasible solutions at most tree nodes. Test results will be discussed for serial and parallel implementations.
