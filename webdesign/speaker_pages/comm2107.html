Title: Bilevel Programming for Biofuel Production Problems<br>Author: Xiangrong Liu, Student, Drexel University, 3141 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, xl35@drexel.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper presents a discrete bilevel optimization model for decision-making in biofuel production. In the upper level problem, the government finds the optimal tax credits to provide farms enough incentives to produce biofuel while the farms allocate their lands to different usages in the lower level problem. We propose to use techniques from nonsmooth nonlinear optimization. Computational results are provided on a numerical example from literature.
