Title: Theoretical Results to Solve Unconstrained Non-linear Mixed Integer Programming Problems<br>Author: Emre Tokgoz, University of Oklahoma, 202 W. Boyd, Room 124, Norman, OK, 73071, United States of America, Emre.Tokgoz-1@ou.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In the literature of mixed integer programming there are not many known theoretical results to solve unconstrained non-linear mixed integer programming problems. In this talk, I will be presenting theoretical results that I obtained to solve unconstrained non-linear mixed integer programming problems for several classes of mixed (i.e. discrete and continuous) variable functions. In addition, I will have suggestions to improve the existing results.
