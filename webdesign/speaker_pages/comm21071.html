Title: Strengthened GMICs for 0-1 Mixed Integer Programs<br>Author: Jean-Philippe Richard, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 315 North Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, jprichar@purdue.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Generating strong cuts for unstructured mixed integer programs is an important but difficult problem. A traditional way of circumventing this difficulty is to generate cuts from single row relaxations of the problem, often using superadditive lifting. In this talk, we describe a sequential lifting procedure to obtain strong valid inequalities that can produce, among other cuts, strengthened GMICs for 0-1 mixed integer programs.
