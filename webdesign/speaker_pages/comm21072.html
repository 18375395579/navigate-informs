However, IMPT distributions are much more sensitive to uncertainties in radiologic path length and set-up errors. To mitigate the effects of these uncertainties, non-linear robust optimization models ranging from expected value optimization to worst-case optimization are developed. We present our results by testing the proposed models on patient cases.</br>
