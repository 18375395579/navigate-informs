Title: Robust Planning Optimization for Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy<br>Author: Behlul Saka, Research Scientist, Elekta, 13723 Riverport Dr Suite 100, Maryland Heights, United States of America, Behlul.Saka@elekta.com<br>Coauthor(s): Chunhua Men<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) provides more degrees of freedom for designing dose distributions than photon IMRT. However, IMPT distributions are much more sensitive to uncertainties in radiologic path length and set-up errors. To mitigate the effects of these uncertainties, non-linear robust optimization models ranging from expected value optimization to worst-case optimization are developed. We present our results by testing the proposed models on patient cases.
