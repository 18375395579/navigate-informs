Title: Mathematical Programming Models for Asset Liability Management (ALM)<br>Author: Katharina Schwaiger, Doctoral Candidate, CARISMA, Brunel University, John Crank Building, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, United Kingdom, Katharina.Schwaiger@brunel.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Gautam Mitra, Cormac Lucas<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present an ALM model for pension funds focusing on matching and outperforming liabilities. We look at two approaches: a deterministic linear programming model which is then extended to a stochastic programming (SP) model. For the SP model, we generate scenarios which take into account the uncertainties in interest rate and RPI which affect both assets and liabilities. Furthermore, we introduce chance constraints and integrated chance constraints to directly manage risk and incorporate risk aversion. We contrast all approaches and analyze the corresponding mismatches.
