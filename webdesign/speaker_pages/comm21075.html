Title: Outbound Baggage Handling with Work Group Pairings<br>Author: Markus Frey, Technische Universität München, Arcisstr. 21, München, Ba, 80333, Germany, markus.frey@wi.tum.de<br>Coauthor(s): Rainer Kolisch, Marco E. Luebbecke<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the outbound baggage handling planning problem at airports. We present an integrated binary model for the assignment and scheduling of flights to handling facilities and the staffing of ground handlers which levels the workload across all carousels and reduces the number of temporary workers.For solving the problem we propose a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and report computational results for real-world instances.
