<br>Title: A Tutorial on Safe Scheduling</br><br>Author: Kenneth Baker, Tuck School, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, 03755, Kenneth.R.Baker@Dartmouth.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Trietsch</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Safe scheduling augments the traditional approach to sequencing and scheduling models by recognizing safety times explicitly. In this paper, we give a brief review of the basic results in scheduling theory, describe how these results have been extended to stochastic cases, and demonstrate how safe scheduling models sharpen our ability to formulate stochastic problems.  Although scheduling theory has historically been driven by optimization methods, we demonstrate how stochastic scheduling problems can be approached with a powerful spreadsheet-based heuristic procedure.</br>
