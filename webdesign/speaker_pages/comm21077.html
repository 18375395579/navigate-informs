<br>Title: A Neurogenetic Approach for Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Anurag Agarwal, Assistant Professor, University of Florida, PO Box 117169, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, anurag.agarwal@cba.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Selcuk Colak, Jason Deane</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a hybrid metaheuristic approach for solving discrete optimization problems in which the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach and a Neural Network (NN) approach are interleaved to provide near-optimal solutions.  The GA and NN approaches have complimentary advantages and disadvantages and therefore are good candidates for hybridizing.  The interleaving requires ways to interchange the coding schemes from one approach to another and we propose some ideas for such interchange.</br>
