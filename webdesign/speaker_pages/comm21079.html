Title: Stochastic Routing for Large-scale Emergencies<br>Author: Zhihong Shen, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Avenue, GER-240,, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, shenz@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Maged Dessouky, Fernando Ordonez<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We are interested in routing problems with large demand, insufficient supply, tight deadline and significant uncertainty, which are typically faced in applications like large-scale emergencies. We model the problem into a stochastic vehicle routing problem and propose two different recourse strategies. A tabu search heuristic is presented; experimental results show the merits of the model and compare the performance of the recourse strategies.
