<br>Title: Efficient Staff Rostering using Column Generation and Generic Programming</br><br>Author: Andrew Mason, Senior Lecturer, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand, a.mason@auckland.ac.nz</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anders Dohn</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a new software system for solving staff rostering problems using column generation. Customising the system for each problem requires specifying problem-specific states and rules to use in the column generator. To do this efficiently, we exploit generic programming principles in which these problem-specific details are given at compile time. This gives a significant improvement in flexibility and a dramatic reduction in run-times.</br>
