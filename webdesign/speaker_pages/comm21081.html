Title: Improving Quality of Service and Fairness in Stochastic Operating Room Planning<br>Author: Yan Deng, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, yandeng@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton, Siqian Shen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Existing research on stochastic operating room planning rely on cost-based formulation that weighs metrics and fails in modeling quality of service or fairness. We introduce a chance-constrained programming formulation that overcomes the drawback. For both formulations, we explore an approach of solving time-indexed reformulation using column generation. We test them on instances generated from real data to compare computational efficacy and draw managerial insights.
