<br>Title: The Test Region Iterative Contraction (TRIC) Method for Solving Stochastic Control Problems</br><br>Author: Chunyu Yang, Assistant Professor, BI Norwegian Business School, Oslo, Norway, yangchy@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stathis Tompaidis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We introduce the test region iterative contraction (TRIC) method to solve high-dimensional discrete-time stochastic control problems under general constraints. The method combines dynamic programming and functional approximations of conditional expectations, and iteratively shrinks the approximation region around the optimal solution. We apply the method to two Finance applications: a) dynamic portfolio choice with constraints; b) dynamic portfolio choice with capital gain taxation.</br>
