Title: Motivations, Models and Algorithms for Scheduling with Multitasking<br>Author: Nicholas G.

Leung<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider scheduling environments with multitasking. We study how the motivation for multitasking affects how multitasking influences a simple scheduling system. For each motivation, we study the solvability of three of the most widely studied and practical classical scheduling problems. We provide a fast optimal algorithm or an intractability result. For the latter case, we describe simple heuristic approaches and demonstrate computationally that they provide close to optimal solutions.
