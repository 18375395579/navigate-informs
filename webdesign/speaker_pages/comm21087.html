<br>Title: Effective Multistart for Reaching Feasibility in Difficult Nonlinear Programs</br><br>Author: John Chinneck, Professor, Carleton University, Systems & Computer Engineering, Ottawa, ON, K1S 5B6, Canada, chinneck@sce.carleton.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew MacLeod</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Finding a feasible solution for a set of nonlinear constraints can be very difficult.  Local solvers may fail if not started close to a feasible region, so an expensive multistart approach may be needed. Instead of using the costly local solver each time, we use cheap Constraint Consensus methods to explore the variable space.  We apply a local solver only when confident that we are close to a feasible region. Experimental results are very promising.</br>
