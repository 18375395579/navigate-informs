<br>Title: Multi-stage Stochastic Optimization and Cloud Computing Applied to Energy Systems</br><br>Author: Luiz Carlos Costa Jr, PSR, Praia de Botafogo 228 / 1701-A, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22250-145, Brazil, luizcarlos@psr-inc.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nora Campodonico, Luiz Mauricio Thom?, Mario Veiga Pereira</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We describe the use of a distributed processing version of the stochastic dual dynamic programming algorithm (SDDP) to two large scale real-life applications: (i) transmission interconnections planning for 16 Latin American countries; and (ii) a spot price forecasting system for the Scandinavian electricity market (Nordpool). Both applications require stochastic scheduling of a very large number of hydro plants and thus the solution of stochastic DP problems with several hundred state variables.</br>
