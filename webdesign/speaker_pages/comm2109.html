Title: On Interior Point Trajectories for Conic Complementarity Problems<br>Author: Akiko Yoshise, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennoudai, Tsukuba, Ib, 305-8573, Japan, yoshise@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We will discuss some theoretical aspects of a class of complementarity problems over homogeneous cones in terms of interior point maps, interior point trajectories and their limiting behavior. The class includes monotone complementarity problems over nonnegative orthants, second-order cones and semideinite matrix cones.
