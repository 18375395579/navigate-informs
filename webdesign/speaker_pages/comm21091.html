<br>Title: Empowering Optimization under Uncertainty Methods with Space-filling Designs</br><br>Author: Peter Qian, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1300 University Ave, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, peterq@stat.wisc.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Space-filling designs, designs where the points are uniformly   distributed, are invented in computer experiments. This talk will report some recent advances in using these designs in solving optimization under uncertainty methods. Both theoretical and numerical results will be given. Also will be discussed are statisitcal enchancements of validation methods for such optimization methods. Joint work with Qi Tang at U of Wisconsin.</br>
