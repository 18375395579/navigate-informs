Title: Derivative-free Optimization for Hydrological Applications<br>Author: Genetha Gray, Sandia National Labs, PO Box 969, MS 9159, Livermore, CA, 94550, United States of America, gagray@sandia.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Tackling water resources management problems routinely requires the pairing of subsurface simulators and optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, the problem formulations introduce a number of obstacles to obtaining reasonable solutions. To overcome these, suitable derivative-free optimization methods can be combined to take advantage of the beneficial elements of multiple methods.  We will demonstrate a hybrid approach on a set of groundwater test problems.
