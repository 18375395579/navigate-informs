Title: Wide Split Cuts<br>Author: Qianyi Wang, Georgia Institute of Technology, 226 triumph dr nw, Atlanta, GA, 30327, United States of America, qwang62@gatech.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The traditional split cut is obtained using a disjunctive argument corresponding to a lattice-free convex set. We introduce a new class of cuts obtained using a similar argument where we replace the lattice-free set with a larger set which may not be lattice-free.  To verify the validly of these cuts, we solve a lower dimensional sub-MIP. We will present theoretical and empirical results about this class of cutting planes.
