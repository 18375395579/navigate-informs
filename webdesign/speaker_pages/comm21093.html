We introduce a new class of cuts obtained using a similar argument where we replace the lattice-free set with a larger set which may not be lattice-free.  To verify the validly of these cuts, we solve a lower dimensional sub-MIP. We will present theoretical and empirical results about this class of cutting planes.</br>
