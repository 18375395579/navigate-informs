Title: Portfolio Selection with Probabilistic Objective Values Using Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms<br>Author: Paul Salasznyk, PhD Candidate, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110th Street, CII 5107, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, salasp@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Wallace<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Many organizations have been making efforts to analyze a large set of project proposals in order to choose project portfolios which maximize the performance, meet resource constraints and minimize risk. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) are well suited for solving optimization problems involving the several, often conflicting objectives in the R&D project portfolio selection problem. We apply this solution method to a problem with probabilistic, interdependent objective values.
