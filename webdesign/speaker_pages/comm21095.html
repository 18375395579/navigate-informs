<br>Title: Modeling the View Selection Problem for Aggregate Queries as an Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem</br><br>Author: Zohreh Asgharzadeh, Graduate Student, North Carolina State University, Graduate Program in Operations Research, NC State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, z_asgharzadeh@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rada Chirkova, Yahya Fathi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We model the view selection problem for aggregate queries in a database as an Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFLP). A key difference between this model and a typical UFLP is that here we have a large (exponential) number of sites.  We propose strategies to reduce the size of this model, hence allowing relatively large instances of the problem to be solved optimally. We also employ this model in the context of a heuristic procedure for solving very large instances of the problem.</br>
