Title: A New Conic Programming Approach for Robust Portfolio Selection Problems<br>Author: Zhaosong Lu, Assistant Professor, Simon Fraser University, Department of Mathematics, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada, zhaosong@sfu.ca<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We introduce the ``joint'' uncertainty structures for portfolio selection problem parameters, which correspond to confidence regions of market parameters constructed by the statistical procedures. Based on the joint uncertainty structures, we provide a new conic programming approach to formulate and solve robust portfolio selection problems without destroying the confidence level of the joint uncertainty strutures. The resulting portfolio is more diversified than the other approaches.
