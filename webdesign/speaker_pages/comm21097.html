Trafalis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this work we employ the Weighted Support Vector Machine (WSVM) approach to solve a facility allocation problem (FAP). The WSVM approach used in this work is a new solution technique that was not applied to allocate facilities previously; preliminary results are presented.</br>
