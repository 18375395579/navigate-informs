Title: Honorable Mention: Slack Time Allocation in Double-Track Train Timetabling<br>Author: Muhammad Babar Khan, Ph.D. Candidate, College of Traffic and Transportation, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 610031, China, babarkhan152@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Xuesong Zhou<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper is concerned with a railway timetable optimization problem in planning and real-time operational stages. The concerned topics include, (1) formulating a two-stage stochastic optimization model, which takes into consideration real-time disturbances in the planning stage, and (2) to propose efficient solution algorithms for solving the proposed stochastic optimization model.
