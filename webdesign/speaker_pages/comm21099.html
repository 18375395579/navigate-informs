The solution space is partitioned into subsets which are sampled and evaluated, and one subset is then determined to be promising for further partitioning. We propose an optimal strategy for allocating samples to subsets so that the probability of correctly selecting the promising subset is maximized. It is effective in improving the performance of random search algorithms by most efficiently utilizing the samples.
