Title: Dedicated to Mike Rothkopf: Monitoring an Information Source under a Politeness Constraint<br>Author: Jonathan Eckstein, Professor, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, RUTCOR Room 155, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, jeckstei@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Avigdor Gal<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Imagine scheduling a limited number of polls to an information source whose contents are continuously modified by a nonhomogeneous Poisson process.  We develop an optimal polling schedule model that is ill-suited to either standard nonlinear or integer programming methods, but - following a suggestion of Mike Rothkopf’s - can be solved to near optimality by a combination of dynamic programming and local search, with provable quality guarantees.
