Title: An Access Network Design Problem With Nonlinear Qos Constraints<br>Author: Chanwoo Park, Korea University, Anamdong 5 Ga, Sungbuk Gu, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, st2v@korea.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Youngho Lee<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present an access network design problem with nonlinear QoS constraints. The problem can be conceptualized as a two-level hierarchical location-allocation problem on the tree topology. By exploiting the special structure of the nonlinear QoS constraints, we devise an exact optimal algorithm with an effective constraint generation strategy. We present promising computational results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution procedure.
