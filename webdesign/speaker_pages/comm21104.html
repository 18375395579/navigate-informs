Title: Cyclic-order Neighborhood Search for Vehicle Routing Problems<br>Author: Justin Goodson, University of Iowa, S210 Pappajohn Bldg., Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, justin-goodson@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Ohlmann, Barrett Thomas<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine the use of a cyclic-order solution representation for solving VRPs. Using simulated annealing, we obtain high quality solutions for the VRP and the VRP with stochastic demands. We propose an updating procedure and demonstrate its ability to reduce the computational expense of our approach. We also present computational results that show that cyclic order neighborhoods are superior to traditional route-based neighborhoods with respect to their ability to minimize fleet size.
