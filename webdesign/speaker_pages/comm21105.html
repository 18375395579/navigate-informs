It is based on a method introduced previously for Boolean satisfiability problems, using XOR constraints. We first extend this method to CSPs by defining the XOR constraints on additional binary variables. Then we show how to group the XOR constraints together in a global constraint. Finally, we apply generalized XOR constraints directly to the CSP variables.
