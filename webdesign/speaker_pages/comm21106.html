<br>Title: Optimal Physician Traveling Assignment for Improving Care Access in an Outpatient Care Network</br><br>Author: Yan Li, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, li528@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Qipeng Zheng, Nan Kong</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling mental health consultation sessions at satellite clinics within an outpatient specialty care network to improve patients' access to care. We formulate the problem as a physician assignment dependent capacitated facility location problem. We develop several column generation based primal heuristics. Our experiments demonstrate conditions under which the idea of scheduling sessions at satellite clinics is appealing and show the efficiency of our algorithm.</br>
