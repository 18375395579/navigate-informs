Title: Best-first and/or Search vs Depth-first Branch-and-bound for 0/1 Integer Programming<br>Author: Rina Dechter, University of California, Irvine, dechter@ics.uci.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Radu Marinescu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Graphical models, including constraint networks, propositional CNF formulas, and Bayesian networks are knowledge representation schemes that capture independence in the knowledge base and support efficient algorithms for a variety of reasoning tasks, including scheduling, planning, diagnosis and situation assessment. The paper shows that general AND/OR search schemes, recently introduced for graphical models, can be applied to integer programming yielding substantial computational saving.
