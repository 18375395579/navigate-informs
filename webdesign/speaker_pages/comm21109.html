Title: Monte Carlo Methods in Stochastic Optimization Problems with Stochastic Dominance Constraints<br>Author: Jian Hu, Northwestern University, Department of IEMS, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, jianhu@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sanjay Mehrotra, Tito Homem-de-Mello<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss stochastic optimization problems where the constraints are modeled using the concept of stochastic dominance. This is an area that has received increasing attention in the literature recently. We study the application of sampling methods to solving such problems when the number of scenarios is too large or even infinite. Theoretical results and algorithms are presented, as well as some numerical experiments illustrating the ideas.
