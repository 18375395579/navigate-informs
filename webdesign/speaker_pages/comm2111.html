<br>Title: MILP Approaches for a Class of Mixed Integer Bi-level Programming Problems</br><br>Author: Mahdi Hamzeei, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, hamzeei@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Luedtke</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a class of mixed integer bilevel programming problems motivated by a facility location  problem with queueing delay considerations. We formulate a mixed-integer bilevel programming problem and derive mixed-integer linear programming approximations of the problem. We also  investigate ways to strengthen the resulting MILP formulations. Numerical results will demonstrate the performance of the approach.</br>
