Title: Accounting for Information Collection in the Stochastic System- Optimum Network Assignment Problem<br>Author: Natalia Ruiz, UT Austin, 6.204 ECJ Hall, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, natiruizjuri@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Travis Waller<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This work introduces solution methodologies for stochastic system-optimum network assignment problems under uncertainty which take into account the collection and distribution of information by the system's assets.  The proposed solution techniques are based on previously developed mathematical formulations. They include optimal algorithms and heuristic methods, which are discussed along with the potential applications of the novel concepts.
