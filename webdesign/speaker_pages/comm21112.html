Smith</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The network design problem with relay stations arises in telecommunications and logistic systems.  The design problem involves selecting network links and determining the location of the relay stations to minimize the design cost.  A constraint is imposed on the distance of a signal can travel without being regenerated by a relay station.  An efficient local search based heuristic is presented to solve large sized problems.</br>
