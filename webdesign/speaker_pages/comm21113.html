Title: On the Connection between Bilinear Optimization and Compressed Sensing<br>Author: Fatma Kilinc-Karzan, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, fkilinc@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study general nonconvex bilinear optimization problems over vector and matrix variables. In many cases, these problems are NP-Hard and thus we establish a framework for building efficient convex relaxations and study their quality. Our framework has applications in testing nullspace property from Compressed Sensing as well as Robust Optimization. We also establish connections with the existing approaches based on RLT and SDP based relaxations.
