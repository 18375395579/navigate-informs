Title: A Computational Study of Linear and Integer Optimization with Multiple-Choice Restrictions<br>Author: Ernee Kozyreff, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States of America, ernee.kozyreff@ttu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ismael de Farias, Ming Zhao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A wide variety of applications require that certain variables have value zero in a feasible solution when other specific variables are nonzero. Such constraints are called multiple-choice. We present new inequalities for solving multiple-choice optimization through branch-and-cut, and an extensive computational experience that reveals new and surprising facts about these problems, their formulations, and the cutting planes.
