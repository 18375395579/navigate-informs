For special structures, we show how projections can lead to concise forms. These structures include knapsack constraints and SOS-d restrictions.  The SOS-2 case allows for the handling of piecewise-linear functions, yielding new representations and motivating existing ones.  Favorable computational experience is reported.</br>
