In this research we seek to find feasible solutions by rounding randomly generated points of the polyhedron defined by an LP relaxation. We generate these points in such a way that they are likely to be close to the optimal solution of the LP relaxation, and therefore of good quality. The initial results show that this method could be promising for many MIPs.</br>
