Snyder</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We construct a decomposable upper bound for the optimal cost of distribution systems with stochastic demand managed with a continuous-review base-stock policy and FIFO allocation rule. By simplifying the upper bound construction procedure and by utilizing the risk-pooling effect, we propose a heuristic for approximating the base-stock levels of all locations. Our heuristic outperforms other recent heuristics on most test instances with average cost 0.81% higher than the optimal cost.</br>
