Title: A Scalable Heuristic for Base-stock Levels in Multi-echelon Distribution Systems<br>Author: Zumbul Bulut, zub205@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ying Rong, Lawrence V. Snyder<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We construct a decomposable upper bound for the optimal cost of distribution systems with stochastic demand managed with a continuous-review base-stock policy and FIFO allocation rule. By simplifying the upper bound construction procedure and by utilizing the risk-pooling effect, we propose a heuristic for approximating the base-stock levels of all locations. Our heuristic outperforms other recent heuristics on most test instances with average cost 0.81% higher than the optimal cost.
