Title: Lagrangean Strategies for the Stochastic Network Design Problem<br>Author: Walter Rei, Professor, Universit?du Québec ?Montréal (UQÀM), 315 Ste-Catherine East (R-3570), Montréal, Qc, H2X 3X2, Canada, walter@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michel Gendreau, Teodor Gabriel Crainic<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Applying Lagrangean relaxation to a discretized formulation of a stochastic network design problem yields a problem that may be decomposed following the scenarios of the random event.  Heuristic and exact procedures may then be used simultaneously to search efficiently the feasible space of the mixed-integer formulation.  A parallel progressive hedging inspired metaheuristic algorithm will be presented to solve the problem.
