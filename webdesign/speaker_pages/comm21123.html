Title: Decision Diagrams for Sequencing and Scheduling Problems<br>Author: Andre Cire, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, acire@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Hooker, David Bergman, Willem-Jan van Hoeve<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) have recently been introduced as a means to obtain a discrete relaxation for combinatorial optimization problems. In this talk, we discuss how DD-based relaxations can be used to model and solve a variety of sequencing and scheduling problems. We also describe techniques which allow the relaxation to be combined with constraint programming and integer programming technologies.
