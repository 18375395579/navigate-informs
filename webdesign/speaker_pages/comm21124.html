Title: Robust Optimal Stopping<br>Author: Andy Sun, Postdoctoral Researcher, IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, andysun@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The optimal stopping problem is a classic problem in applied probability and stochastic control with many applications. We consider a distribution-free approach to this traditional problem in situations where probability transition information is not available or probability models are not appropriate. We propose models that describe state-transition behaviors in the robust setting and characterize optimal and sub-optimal policies for single-choice and multiple-choice optimal stopping problems.
