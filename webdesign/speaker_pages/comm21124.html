We consider a distribution-free approach to this traditional problem in situations where probability transition information is not available or probability models are not appropriate. We propose models that describe state-transition behaviors in the robust setting and characterize optimal and sub-optimal policies for single-choice and multiple-choice optimal stopping problems.</br>
