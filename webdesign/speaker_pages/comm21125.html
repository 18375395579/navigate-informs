Title: Mixed Integer Formulation of the Critical Resource Diagramming Method<br>Author: Adedeji Badiru, Professor and Department Head, Air Force Institute of Technology, AFIT/ENV 2950 Hobson Way, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, OH, 45433, United States of America, adedeji.badiru@afit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ashish Nemani, Ravindra Ahuja<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Critical Resource Diagramming (CRD) was formulated as an extension of PERT/CPM; but with the constraint of scheduling from the resource viewpoint rather than activity viewpoint and the added requirement that a resource unit can appear at multiple locations in the schedule.  We present an integer programming formulation for the CRD problem to generate all possible starting times and assign a variable to each of them with the objective of minimizing the project makespan.
