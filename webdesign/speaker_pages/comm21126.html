Title: Scenario Tree Generation for Stochastic Programming Models using GAMS/SCENRED<br>Author: Holger Heitsch, Humboldt-University Berlin, Unter den Linden 6, Berlin, 10099, Germany, heitsch@math.hu-berlin.de<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Dirkse<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: When solving multistage stochastic programs the stochastic input process is approximated by a process having finite support. The scenarios must exhibit tree structure in order to reflect the monotone information structure of the input data. Using the new software tool GAMS/SCENRED such scenario trees can be generated. The tree construction is based on recent scenario tree approximation schemes which rely on approximation and stability results for linear multistage models.
