We develop a stochastic integer programming model for nurse assignment with an objective to minimize excess workload on nurses. The problem is solved using a Benders?decomposition approach, in which a greedy algorithm is implemented to solve the recourse subproblem. We propose sets of valid inequalities to strengthen the relaxed master problem. Computational results are presented.</br>
