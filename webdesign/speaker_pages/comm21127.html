Title: A Stochastic Programming Model for Nurse Assignment<br>Author: Prattana Punnakitikashem, The University of Texas at Arlington, PO Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, prattana.punnakitikashem@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Our research focuses on the last stage of nurse planning, which makes daily decisions on assigning nurses to patients. We develop a stochastic integer programming model for nurse assignment with an objective to minimize excess workload on nurses. The problem is solved using a Benders?decomposition approach, in which a greedy algorithm is implemented to solve the recourse subproblem. We propose sets of valid inequalities to strengthen the relaxed master problem. Computational results are presented.
