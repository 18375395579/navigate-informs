This intractability is due primarily to the high dimensionality of a commodity forward curve in the MDP state. We develop a novel approximate dynamic programming approach based on relaxations of approximate linear programs. Focusing on natural gas storage, we provide theoretical and numerical support for the proposed approach.</br>
