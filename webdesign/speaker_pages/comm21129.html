Title: Optimizing the Supply Chain for a Pulp Industry Using Decomposition Schemes<br>Author: Helene Gunnarsson, Linköping Institute of Technology, Division of Optimization, S-581 83, Linköping, Sweden, hegun@mai.liu.se<br>Coauthor(s): Mikael Ronnqvist, Dick Carlsson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of planning the production, transportation and distribution of products in the pulp industry. The problem includes both binary and continuous decisions for production mix, terminal usage and ship routes, flows etc. We propose a mathematical model for the entire supply chain and we present a number of decomposition schemes to get a solution in acceptable computational time.
