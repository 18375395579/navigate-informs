Title: Unsupervised Feature Selection using Weighted Principal Components<br>Author: Panaya Rattakorn, PhD Student, The University of Texas at Arlington, PO Box 19017 Woolf Hall, IMSE Department, Alington, TX, 76010, United States of America, prattakorn@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Feature selection becomes challenging when ten thousands or more variables are presented in the data sets.  We propose the unsupervised feature selection method that combines weighted principal components with a recursive thresholding algorithm. Simulation results demonstrated the proposed method is capable of selecting the subset of features that are important.
