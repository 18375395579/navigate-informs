Title: Proactive and Efficient Spare Parts Inventory Management Policies<br>Author: Jingyao Gu, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON, N9B 3P4, Canada, gujingyao2013@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Guoqing Zhang, Kevin Li<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study multiple spare parts inventory problems with a budget constraint. The non-linear programming models are developed to obtain optimal spare parts replenishment policies for failure-based maintenance in a single period. We explore a Lagrangian relaxation heuristic method by relaxing the budget constraint and decomposing the large size problem into multiple single PN sub-problems.
