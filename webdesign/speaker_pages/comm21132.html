<br>Title: A Decomposition Approach to Solve Network Design Problem  in Packaged Gases</br><br>Author: Tejinder Pal Singh, Research Scientist, Air Liquide, 12800 W. Little York Rd, Houston, TX, 77041, United States of America, tejinder.singh@airliquide.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michele QUATTRONE</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Network design problems can be very large-scale and need approximation approaches to solve them. Network Configuration in packages gases is a strategic decision that impacts the tactical delivery planning and daily scheduling and transportation operations. We develop a decomposition approach to solve the network design problem which has multiple objectives related to location of plants and their capacities, stock and resources management.</br>
