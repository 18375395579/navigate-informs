Title: New Decomposition Methods for the Network Revenue Management Problem with Customer Choice Behavior<br>Author: Sumit Kunnumkal, Assistant Professor, Indian School of Business, AC 4, Level 1, 4116, Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, AP, 500032, India, sumit_kunnumkal@isb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Huseyin Topaloglu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a new dynamic programming decomposition method for the network revenue management problem with customer choice behavior. The novel aspect of our approach is that it chooses the revenue allocations by solving an auxiliary optimization problem that incorporates the probabilistic nature of the customer choices.  Computational experiments indicate that our approach provides significant improvements over two standard benchmark methods.
