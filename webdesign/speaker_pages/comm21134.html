Title: A New Perspective on Generating Facets for Polyhedral Second-Order Conic Sets<br>Author: Sujeevraja Sanjeevi, Researcher, Emerging Technologies Building, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, sujeevraja@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kiavash Kianfar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a new procedure to develop facets for the polyhedral second-order conic sets. We show that n-step conic MIR inequalities are simply the result of this procedure. We also show that this procedure generalizes to other polyhedral sets and can be used to develop strong valid inequalities based on valid inequalities for simpler sets.
