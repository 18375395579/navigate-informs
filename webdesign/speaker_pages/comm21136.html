<br>Title: Efficient Metaheuristics for Large-scale Integrated Network Design and Inventory Stocking Problems</br><br>Author: Erhan Kutanoglu, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C2200, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, erhank@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yi Sui, Wes Barnes</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Integrated logistics network design and inventory stocking problems are computationally challenging due to their size and inherent complexity, especially due to service level constraints. Considering that exact methods take prohibitely long time to even find a feasible solution to such problems, we develop a reactive tabu search-based method that finds near-optimal integrated solutions. In this talk, we present our preliminary but promising tabu search results.</br>
