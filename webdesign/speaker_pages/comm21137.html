Title: Deterministic Models for Stochastic Service Network Design Problems<br>Author: Michal Kaut, Molde University College, P.O. Box 2110, Molde, NO-6402, Norway, michal.kaut@himolde.no<br>Coauthor(s): Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Stein W. Wallace<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Real-life service-network design problems are difficult to solve even in a deterministic case, so solving them as stochastic programs is close to impossible. On the other hand, we have earlier demonstrated that introducing stochastic demand into such models produces solutions qualitatively different from the deterministic ones.  We thus propose a heuristic that solves the deterministic problem, but at the same time imposes the qualitative properties observed in the stochastic solutions.
