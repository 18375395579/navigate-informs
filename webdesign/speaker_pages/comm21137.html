On the other hand, we have earlier demonstrated that introducing stochastic demand into such models produces solutions qualitatively different from the deterministic ones.  We thus propose a heuristic that solves the deterministic problem, but at the same time imposes the qualitative properties observed in the stochastic solutions.</br>
