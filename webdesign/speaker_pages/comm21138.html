Title: Convex Approximations in Stochastic Programming by Semidefinite Programming<br>Author: Istvan Deak, Professor, Department of Computer Science, Corvinus University of Budapest, Hungary, istvan.deak@uni-corvinus.hu<br>Coauthor(s): Imre Polik, Andras Prekopa, Tamás Terlaky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The following question arises in stochastic programming: how can one approximate a noisy convex function with a convex quadratic function that is is optimal in some sense. Using several approaches for constructing convex approximations we present some optimization models yielding convex quadratic regressions that are optimal approximations in L_1, L_2 and L_infinity norm. Extensive numerical experiments to investigate the behavior of the proposed methods are also performed.
