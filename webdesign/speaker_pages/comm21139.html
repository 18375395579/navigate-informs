Title: Sequential Quasi-Monte Carlo Sampling: Construction and Diverse Applications<br>Author: Ben Haaland, Student, UW-Madison, 3818 Frosted Leaf Dr., Madison, WI, 53719, United States of America, benhaaland@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Qian<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Sequences of nested, extendable space filling designs are useful in statistics, computer science, and numerical analysis. Results for nesting and extending a class of designs with good uniformity properties, the (t,m,s)-nets and (t,s)-sequences, are presented. Applications and examples in numerical integration, design and modeling for computer experiments with multiple levels of accuracy and expense, and stochastic programming are given.
