Title: An Expected Value Constrained Two-stage Stochastic Unit Commitment with Uncertain Wind Power Output<br>Author: Chaoyue Zhao, cherryzhao09@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yongpei Guan, Qianfan Wang, Jianhui Wang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper proposes an expected value and chance  constrained stochastic optimization approach to handle the wind  power penetration problem for the reliability unit commitment  run by ISOs/RTOs. We consider conventional thermal generator  constraints while accommodating the wind output uncertainty. We use a  Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method to transform the  expected objective value, the expected value constraint and the  chance constraint into a sample average reformulation.
