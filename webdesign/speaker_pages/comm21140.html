<br>Title: Subgradient Bounds for Convex Dynamic Programs</br><br>Author: David Brown, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Box 90120, Durham, NC, 27708-0120, United States of America, dbbrown@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jim Smith</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the use of information relaxations and penalty functions to compute bounds on the performance of an optimal policy for convex stochastic dynamic programs. We develop two penalty functions, both based on subgradients of approximate value functions. We study properties of the resulting bounds and show that the approach can, in theory, lead to tight bounds. Finally, we demonstrate the method on some challenging applications, including inventory control with lost sales and long lead times.</br>
