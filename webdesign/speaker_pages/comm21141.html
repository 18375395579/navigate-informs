Title: Univariate Stochastic Root-finding for Monotone, Convex Functions<br>Author: Samuel Ehrlichman, Cornell University, School of ORIE, Rhodes Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, se52@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shane Henderson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the one-dimensional root finding problem for increasing convex functions. We give algorithms for both exact, and inexact (stochastic), function evaluations. For the stochastic case, we supply a probabilistic convergence guarantee in the spirit of selection-of-the-best methods.  The algorithm's worst-case performance bound is an improvement upon that of its close cousin, stochastic binary search, by a constant factor.
