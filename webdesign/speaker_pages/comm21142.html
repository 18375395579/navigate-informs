Title: Innovization: Discovery of Innovative Knowledge through Multi-criterion Optimization<br>Author: Kalyanmoy Deb, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, 48824, United States of America, kdeb@egr.msu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A consideration of multiple conflicting objectives allows us to find multiple trade-off solutions. Since these solutions are near-optimal, an analysis of them should reveal important insights about common principles shared by these solutions. We show the importance of innovization by demonstrating on a number of practical problem solving tasks.
