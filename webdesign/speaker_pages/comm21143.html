Title: On Interior-point Warmstarts for Combinatorial Optimization Problems<br>Author: Alexander Engau, University of Waterloo, Department of Management Sciences, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, aengau@alumni.clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Miguel Anjos, Anthony Vannelli<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The solution of discrete optimization problems often depends  on the ability to efficiently solve series of closely related  subproblems commonly arising from branch-and-bound or alternative  cutting schemes. In this talk, we discuss our recent progress on  warmstarting an interior-point algorithm to quickly solve the  associated LP/SDP relaxations, for which we present encouraging  preliminary results on several numerical test instances.
