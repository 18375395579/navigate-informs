Title: Multilevel Models in Stochastic Programming with Coherent Risk Measures<br>Author: Jonathan Eckstein, Professor, Rutgers University, 100 Rockafeller Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08540, United States of America, jeckstei@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Although there is only decision maker, we propose a multilevel optimization modeling scheme that allows simple coherent risk measures to be used in multistage stochastic program without running afoul of time inconsistency.  We have proven that the resulting models are NP-hard even in the simplest cases, but argue empirically that some nontrivial practical instances may not be difficult to solve.  Our models also have special structure that may allow the development of customized algorithms.
