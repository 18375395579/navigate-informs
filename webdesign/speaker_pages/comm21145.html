Title: A Benders' Decomposition Algorithm for Chance-Constrained MIPs<br>Author: Ludwig Kuznia, Walt Disney World, 1375 E. Buena Vista, Lake Buena Vista, United States of America, lkuznia@mail.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this presentation, an innovative application of Benders' decomposition is presented as a solution method for chance-constrained MIPs.  Roughly speaking, this can be viewed as a two-phase approach.  In the first phase, valid cutting planes are found by solving a relaxed problem.  This information is used to seed the Benders' algorithm in the second phase.
