Title: A Hybrid Monte Carlo Local Branching Algorithm for the Single VRP with Stochastic Demands<br>Author: Michel Gendreau, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada, michelg@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Walter Rei, Patrick Soriano<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a new algorithm that uses both local branching and Monte Carlo sampling in a multi-descent search strategy for solving 0-1 integer stochastic programming problems. This procedure is applied to the single vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands. Computational results show the usefulness of this new approach to solve hard instances of the problem.
