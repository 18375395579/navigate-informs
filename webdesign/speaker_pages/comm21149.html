Title: Cutting Planes in SCIP<br>Author: Kati Wolter, PhD Candidate, Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB), Takustr. 7, Berlin, 14195, Germany, wolter@zib.de<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: SCIP is a solver for constraint integer programming, which integrates   constraint programming and mixed integer programming modeling and solving techniques. We introduce one component of the solver, namely  the generation of cutting planes. The solver includes efficient separation algorithms for general cutting planes as well as for problem specific cutting planes.
