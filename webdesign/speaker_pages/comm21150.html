In RT, the targets are typically large and overlap with healthy organs, and require homogeneous dose coverage. We use a fast geometry-based algorithm to select isocentres to provide quality RT treatments. After isocentres selection, a sector duration optimization is used to find the final shot shapes. This approach was tested on seven cases and yielded clinically satisfactory treatments.
