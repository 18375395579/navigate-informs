We propose a supporting station structure that decomposes complicated interdependent disruptions at service facilities into much simpler i.i.d. disruptions at supporting stations. We consolidate the reliable location design problem under an exponential number of disruption scenarios into a compact polynomial-size integer programming model. This model can be efficiently solved by commercial solvers.</br>
