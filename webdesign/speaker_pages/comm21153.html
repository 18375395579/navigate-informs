Title: Reliable Infrastructure Location Design under Interdependent Disruptions<br>Author: Xiaopeng Li, Mississippi State University, Department of Civil and Environmental En, PO Box 9546, 235L Walker Hall, 501 Hardy, Mississippi State, MS, 39759, United States of America, xli@cee.msstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fan Peng, Yanfeng Ouyang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a facility location model under interdependent facility disruption risks. We propose a supporting station structure that decomposes complicated interdependent disruptions at service facilities into much simpler i.i.d. disruptions at supporting stations. We consolidate the reliable location design problem under an exponential number of disruption scenarios into a compact polynomial-size integer programming model. This model can be efficiently solved by commercial solvers.
