Title: Monte Carlo Evolutionary Policy Iteration with Applications to Energy R&D Portfolio Optimization<br>Author: Lauren Hannah, Princeton University, Department of ORFE, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, lhannah@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This presentation extends Evolutionary Policy Iteration, a technique for solving Markov Decision Processes, to optimization of a noisy cost function over a finite decision set. A sampling regime and proof of convergence are given. EPI-MC is used in the context of energy R&D portfolio optimization. It is compared numerically on this problem to other algorithms.
