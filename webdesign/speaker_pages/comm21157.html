Title: Sample Average Approximation of Mean-risk Stochastic Programs<br>Author: Shabbir Ahmed, Georgia Institute of Technology, sahmed@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Wang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Sample Average Approximation (SAA) has been very successful for solving traditional risk-neutral stochastic programs involving an expectation objective. We investigate the SAA method for solving some classes of risk averse stochastic programs involving a weighted mean-risk objective.
