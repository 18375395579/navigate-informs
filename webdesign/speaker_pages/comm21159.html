These formulations can be interpreted as a composition of  |V|-1 polyhedra for minimum s-t cuts paralleling early  algorithmic approaches to finding globally minimum cuts, which relied on  |V|-1 calls to a minimum s-t cut algorithm. We present the first  formulation to beat this bound, one that uses O(|V|^2) variables and  O(|V|^3) constraints.  Our formulation directly implies a smaller compact formulation equivalent to the subtour relaxation of the Traveling Salesman Problem.  This talk covers research conducted jointly with Robert Carr, Greg Little, Goran Konjevod, and Venkatesh Natarajan.</br>
