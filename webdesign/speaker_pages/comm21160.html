Title: Use of Complementarity Constraints to Solve Partially Discrete OPF-MPEC Problems<br>Author: Pierre Girardeau, Artelys, 12, rue du 4 Septembre, Paris, France, pierre.girardeau@artelys.com<br>Coauthor(s): Manuel Ruiz, Arnaud Renaud, Jean Maeght, Sylvain Mouret<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present numerical optimization methodologies to solve partially discrete Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems on a large scale. This work is done jointly with the French TSO, RTE, within the iTesla project.    Our objective in iTesla is two-fold: efficiently deal with integer variables using MPEC formulations and treat large-scale problems (several thousands of buses). Using AMPL and KNITRO, we show how these objectives have been reached, both on academic/IEEE and on real-life instances.
