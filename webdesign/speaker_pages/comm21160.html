This work is done jointly with the French TSO, RTE, within the iTesla project.    Our objective in iTesla is two-fold: efficiently deal with integer variables using MPEC formulations and treat large-scale problems (several thousands of buses). Using AMPL and KNITRO, we show how these objectives have been reached, both on academic/IEEE and on real-life instances.</br>
