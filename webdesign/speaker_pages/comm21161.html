Title: A Multiple-drawer Medication Layout Problem in Automated Dispensing Cabinets<br>Author: Jennifer Pazour, Assistant Professor, University of Central Florida, 4000 Central Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL, 32816, United States of America, Jennifer.Pazour@ucf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Russell Meller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate the problem of locating medications in automated dispensing cabinets to minimize human selection errors. We formulate the multiple-drawer medication layout problem as a quadratic assignment problem. As a way to evaluate various medication layouts, we develop a similarity rating for medication pairs. To solve industry-sized problem instances, we develop a heuristic approach.
