Title: Need and Potential for Real-Time Integer Programming<br>Author: George Nemhauser, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, Department of Industrial Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States, gnemhaus@isye.gatech.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Until recently, most applications of integer programming have been to planning models where solution time is not an issue. Significant improvements in methodology, high-speed computing and data availability have made it possible to apply integer programming at the operational level where solution time may take minutes. The next challenge is real-time integer programming. In this talk we discuss some applications for which optimality in real-time is important and some ideas for making real-time integer programming a reality.
