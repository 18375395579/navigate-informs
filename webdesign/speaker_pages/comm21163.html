Title: High Dimensional Revenue Management<br>Author: Dragos Florin Ciocan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 100 Main Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, ciocan@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vivek Farias<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This research is motivated by Ad-Display allocation. In practice, the dimensionality of the impression stream (up to a billion arrivals daily) makes traditional RM approaches intractable. We introduce a low rank model in which the number of impression types is exponential in some rank parameter. We present a scheme that learns a near optimal solution to the original allocation problem using a number of samples that is polynomial in the rank of the impression space and the number of advertisers.
