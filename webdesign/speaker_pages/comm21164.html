System and Solving a Large-Scale Facility Location Problem</br><br>Author: Maria Boile, Associate Professor, Rutgers University, Civil and Environmental Engineering, 100 Brett Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, boile@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Neha Mittal, Alok Baveja, Sotiris Theofanis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we analyze the stochasticity in the container trade volumes and perform a two-stage stochastic analysis with recourse to determine an optimal set of inland depots. The work builds on our previous effort that introduced the concept of an ‘Inland-Depots-for-Empty-Containers?(IDEC) System for effective regional repositioning of empty containers. This work also develops a randomized rounding search heuristic to solve large-size MIP IDEC problems.</br>
