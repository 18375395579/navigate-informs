<br>Title: Functional Modules in Protein- Protein Interaction Networks Via Prize-collecting Steiner Trees</br><br>Author: Gunnar W. Klau, CWI, Kruislaan 413, Amsterdam, 1098, Netherlands, gunnar@math.fu-berlin.de</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: An important topic in systems biology is the identification of functional modules in PPI networks by means of detecting jointly differentially expressed network regions. Here we present an exact integer linear programming solution for this problem, which is based on its connection to the well-known prize-collecting Steiner tree problem from Operations Research.</br>
