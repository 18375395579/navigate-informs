(Jay) Jayakrishnan, Ji Young Park</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A facility location model for EV taxi charging station is proposed, which considers: (1) itinerary-interception; (2) stochastic demand as dynamic passenger requests; (3) queue delay at stations. A bi-level simulation-optimization solution method is used to combine upper level multi-server allocation model and lower level dispatch simulation. The solution algorithm is tested on a fleet of 600 shared-taxis in Korea, a budget of 100 stations, and 22 locations, against a benchmark genetic algorithm.</br>
