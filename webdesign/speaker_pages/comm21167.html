Walteros, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present a way to decompose large-scale networks into smaller subproblems that can then be recombined to obtain a high-quality solution to the, inherently difficult, problem of evacuation. We discuss real-life examples, and provide computational results that prove the success of our efforts.</br>
