<br>Title: Representation of Nonconvexities in Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP)</br><br>Author: Fernanda Thom? Research Engineer, PSR, Praia de Botafogo 228 / 1701-A, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22250145, Brazil, fernanda@psr-inc.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mario Veiga Pereira, Sérgio Granville, Marcia Fampa</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This work describes an extension of the SDDP algorithm to represent nonconvexities such as variation of hydro production coefficient with storage and thermal unit commitment. The proposed methodology uses a Lagrangean relaxation on the water balance equation to generate convex Benders cuts during the backward recursion phase, with a special procedure to find the optimal multiplier. The approach will be illustrated with a realistic hydrothermal scheduling problem.</br>
