Title: Representation of Nonconvexities in Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP)<br>Author: Fernanda Thom?

The proposed methodology uses a Lagrangean relaxation on the water balance equation to generate convex Benders cuts during the backward recursion phase, with a special procedure to find the optimal multiplier. The approach will be illustrated with a realistic hydrothermal scheduling problem.
