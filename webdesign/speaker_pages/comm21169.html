Title: Using Decomposition to Solve Extremely Large Scale & Dense LP Models<br>Author: Peter Nieuwesteeg, Senior AIMMS Specialist, Paragon Decision Technology, 5400 Carillion Point, Kirkland, WA, 98033, United States, Peter.Nieuwesteeg@aimms.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Based on a customer case, we show the power of AIMMS?Generated Mathematical Program library (GMP) to solve large scale and dense LP problems. The case requires solving large problems (>35 million non-zeroes) several times within a limited time frame, something standard LP solving techniques were unable to do. By using the GMP functionality, a customized decomposition approach has been build which takes advantage of problem structure. It now allows the customer to solve the problem on time.
