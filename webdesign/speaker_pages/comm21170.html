This problem can be formulated as a MIP of gigantic size that cannot be solved with off-the-shelf software. To obtain solutions, we develop a heuristic that produces, in the first phase, an aggregate solution that is later refined in the second phase. We provide some computational results evaluating the speed and quality of solutions using real application data.</br>
