<br>Title: Artelys - Optimizing Military Attacks on Multi-commodity SC Networks: Min-max Problem Solved with Artelys Kalis</br><br>Author: Sylvain Mouret, Artelys, 12 rue du Quatre Septembre, Paris, 75002, France, sylvain.mouret@artelys.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Learn how easy it is to solve general min-max problems arising in adversarial games with Artelys Kalis. Thanks to its hybrid CP/MIP architecture, it is possible to build an efficient branch and bound method specialized for such problems in just a few lines of code. We will demonstrate how Kalis has been embedded in a full-range operational solution based on the Artelys Network Designer GIS visualization platform. This solution is currently used to study supply chain network vulnerabilities with respect to military attacks.</br>
