<br>Title: A Comparison Between DP-based Bounds for the TSP</br><br>Author: Ricardo Fukasawa, Associate Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, N2L3G1, Canada, rfukasaw@math.uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Qian</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present two different families of formulations for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). One is based on a Branch-and-cut-and-price approach (BCP) and the other one based on Approximate Linear Programming formulations (ALP) for the shortest path TSP formulation.     Both of these bounds are defined in terms of a parameter t which gives a tradeoff between formulation size and bound quality.    Our results show that the BCP_{t+1} dominate the ALP_t bound for any t.</br>
