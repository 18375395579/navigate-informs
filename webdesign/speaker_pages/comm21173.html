Title: LPCC approach to Nonconvex Quadratic Programs<br>Author: Jing Hu, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Amons Eaton 301, 110 8th street, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, huj@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Mitchell, Jong-Shi Pang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This talk presents a novel approach to general nonconvex quadratic programs. The global resolution of a feasible QP, which is not known a priori to be bounded or unbounded below, can be accomplished by resolving two linear programs with linear complementarity constraints (LPCC). The first LPCC confirms whether the QP is bounded below or not; and the second one computes a globally optimal solution if such a solution exists.
