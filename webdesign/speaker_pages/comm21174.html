Title: Optimal Allocation of Renewable and Non-Renewable Resources in Disasters<br>Author: Shengbin Wang, Rutgers University, 1 Washington Park, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, seraph719@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Lei Lei<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider an allocation problem over a two-stage supply chain network with renewable and non-renewable resources, which is encountered from the practice of providing medical service to people in the affected area by a disaster. This situation is modeled as a MIP to coordinate both resources to minimize the total tardiness. We analyze the problem properties and based on that we provide a heuristic algorithm to solve it efficiently.
