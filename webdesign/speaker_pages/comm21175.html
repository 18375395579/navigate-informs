Title: Cutting Plane Methods for Two Stage Problems with Conditional Risk Mappings<br>Author: Andrzej Ruszczynski, Professor, Rutgers University, 94 Rockefeller Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, rusz@business.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Naomi Miller<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We shall discuss two stage stochastic programming problems with risk measures used at both stages. We shall develop and compare cutting plane methods for solving such problems, and we shall illustrate the results on a financial planning problem.
