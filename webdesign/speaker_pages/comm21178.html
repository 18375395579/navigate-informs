Title: Optimization of Recipe for and Scheduling of Gasoline Blending and Distribution<br>Author: Jie Li, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117576, Singapore, g0304872@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Iftekhar Karimi, Rajagopalan Srinivasan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a more efficient formulation for simultaneous treatment of recipe, blending, scheduling, and distribution in contrast to previous works that have considered only parts of these and a new algorithm to solve the nonlinearity arising from the variable property indices of the input materials to the bending unit. Several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our formulation and algorithm.
