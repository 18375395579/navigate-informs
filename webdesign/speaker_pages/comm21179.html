<br>Title: The Corridor Method?A General Solution Concept with Application to the Blocks Relocation Problem</br><br>Author: Stefan Voss, Professor, University of Hamburg, IWI - Von-Melle-Park 5, Hamburg, HH, 20146, Germany, stefan.voss@uni-hamburg.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Moshe Sniedovich, Marco Caserta</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Corridor Method is a method-based metaheuristic. Based on an algorithm working well at least on small instances of a given problem it defines one or more neighborhoods well suited for the problem and the algorithm. These neighborhoods are viewed as corridors around given solutions. Experiments show that this approach is a successful hybridization between exact and metaheuristic methods. Successful applications for the blocks relocation problem arising, e.g., at container terminals are shown.</br>
