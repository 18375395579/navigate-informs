<br>Title: Incorporating Cutting Planes into the PICO Mixed Integer Solver</br><br>Author: Jonathan Eckstein, Professor, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, jeckstei@rutcor.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Hart, Cynthia Phillips</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: PICO is an open source, massively parallel branch-and-bound search framework under development at Sandia National Labs. This talk focuses on the incorporation of cutting planes into PICO's mixed integer programming layer. We describe our cut finder scheduling strategy, experience with COIN's Cut Generation Library (CGL), new general cutting planes implemented in PICO, support for user-defined cutting planes, and parallelization issues.</br>
