<br>Title: Optimizing Trading Decisions for Hydro Storage Systems using Approximate Dual Dynamic Programming</br><br>Author: Nils Löhndorf, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Nordbergstr 15/3/A, Vienna, 1090, Austria, nils.loehndorf@wu.ac.at</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Wozabal, Stefan Minner</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Optimal operation of hydro storage systems in electricity markets is a complex stochastic optimization problem. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process where a stochastic mixed-integer program is solved in each time period. To find a near-optimal policy, we propose a solution approach that computes a polyhedral approximation of the value function. We describe how we applied the approach to optimize the operation of a real-world hydro storage system in the Austrian Alps.</br>
