<br>Title: Simulation for Optimization of Stochastic Decision Processes</br><br>Author: Suvrajeet Sen, Professor, University of Southern California, Daniel J. Epstein Department  of ISE, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, S.sen@USC.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Harsha Gangammanvar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In contrast to simulation optimization, we consider the process of simulation for the purposes of optimizing stochastic decision processes.  Motivated by the success of stochastic decomposition for two-stage stochastic programs, we present an optimization algorithm in which simulation concepts (initialization bias, sampling, bootstrapping etc.) are coupled with optimization concepts (decomposition, approximation, and regularization) to address sequential decision problems.</br>
