Title: An Optimal Algorithm for Solving a Ring-Mesh Topology Design Problem of the Optical Networks<br>Author: Youngjin Kim, Korea University, Anam Dong Sungbuk Ku, Seoul, 136-701, South Korea, itmsl@dreamwiz.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jeonghee Han, Youngho Lee, Youngwook Kim, Kyunam Chang, Hyunjung Yun<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper, we develop an optimal algorithm to solve a ring-mesh topology design problem arising from the deployment of emerging optical networks. We investigate the dynamic cut generation procedure that combines the benefit of the column generation procedure with the efficiency of Lagrangian dual approach. Computational results of the lower and upper bounding procedures demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution procedure.
