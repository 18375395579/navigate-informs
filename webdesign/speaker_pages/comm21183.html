<br>Title: Scenario Reduction for Futures Market Trading in Electricity Markets</br><br>Author: Miguel Carrion, Univ. Castilla - La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain, Miguel.Carrion@uclm.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antonio J. Conejo, Salvador Pineda</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: To make informed decisions in futures markets of electric energy, stochastic programming models are commonly used. The number of scenarios needed to accurately represent the uncertainty involved is generally large, which renders the associated problem hard to solve. Hence, scenario reduction techniques are needed to trim down the number of scenarios while keeping most of the stochastic information embedded in such scenarios. This presentation provides a novel scenario reduction procedure.</br>
