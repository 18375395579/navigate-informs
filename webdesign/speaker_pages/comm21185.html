Title: A Novel Scenario Reduction Method for Two-stage Stochastic Programs<br>Author: Ali Koc, IBM Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, akoc@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a novel scenario reduction method for two-stage stochastic programs. The objective is to minimize the bound on the worst case performance of the optimal value of the reduced problem under the original problem. The method considers both the uncertainty and the underlying optimization problem, as opposed the methods that just consider the uncertainty. We show that both the theoretical bounds and the numerical results obtained by the method are tighter than the methods in literature.
