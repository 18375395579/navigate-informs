Title: A Robust Non-parametric Approach to Valuing Fixed-income Portfolios Based on Sum-of-squares Program<br>Author: Adrian Becker, MIT, Boston, MA, United States of America, adrianbb@mit.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We formulate robust counterparts to the fixed-income portfolio valuation problems as sum-of-squares programs. This allows us to value baskets of fixed-income securities without making specific assumptions as to the dynamics of joint default or joint loss-given-default.  We then compare our method to the current state of the art in importance sampling based approaches and analyze the impact of using such a robust optimization technique for the valuation and rating of securitization tranches.
