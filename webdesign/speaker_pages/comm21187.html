Title: Parallel Machine Scheduling to Minimize Weighted Completion Time Variance<br>Author: Yang Sun, Assistant Professor, California State University, Sacramento, College of Business Administration, 6000 J Street, Sacramento, CA, 95819, United States, yang.sun@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Fowler, Xueping Li<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The parallel machine scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing completion time variance has many structural optimality properties. However, these properties do not hold for cases in which the objective is to minimize weighted CTV. Hence, it is difficult to develop constructive heuristics for the weighted version of the problem. In this research, we use a genetic algorithm and a set of greedy heuristics to search for better solutions. Computational results are also provided.
