<br>Title: Simulation Optimization with Industrial Strength COMPASS</br><br>Author: Barry Nelson, Professor, Northwestern University, Department of IEMS, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States, nelsonb@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jie Xu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present an algorithm for optimizing the expected performance of stochastic simulations with respect to integer-ordered decision variables. The algorithm combines the convergence theory of COMPASS (Convergent Optimization via Most Promising Area Stochastic Search), heuristic search techniques to enhance practical performance,and statistical procedures to provide inference on the estimated optimal solution.</br>
