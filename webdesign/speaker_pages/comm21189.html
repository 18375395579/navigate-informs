Title: Stochastic Control of Interest Rates<br>Author: Daniel Mitchell, University of Texas, McCombs School of Business, Austin, TX, United States of America, daniel.mitchell@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haolin Feng, Kumar Muthuraman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine the effect that a central bank's interventions have on longer term interest rate securities. We model the central bank's intervention as a stochastic control problem on a general class of processes, and develop a computational method to solve the problem. Using this method we solve for the central bank's optimal control policy and also study the effect of this on longer term interest rate securities using a change of measure.
