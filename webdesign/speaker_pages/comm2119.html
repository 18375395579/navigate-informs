<br>Title: A New User Equilibriom Formulation for Transportation Networks</br><br>Author: Dung-Ying Lin, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan - ROC, dylin@mail.ncku.edu.tw</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pak Weng Leong</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The traditional trip-based approach to transportation modeling has been employed for the past decade.  The last step of the trip-based modeling approach is traffic assignment, which has been typically formulated as a user equilibrium (UE) problem.  In the conventional perspective, the definition of UE traffic assignment is the condition that no road user can unilaterally change routes to reduce their travel time.  The underlying assumption of the UE definition is that road users have full information on the available transportation paths and can potentially use any path if the currently used path is overly congested.  However, a more practical scenario is that each road user has a limited path set within which she/he can choose routes from.  We introduce a new formulation of the user equilibrium to capture the feature and derive optimality conditions based on this formulation. To efficiently solve this problem, we devise path-based and link-based solution algorithms.  Numerical results demonstrate that new equilibrium results can differ significantly from UE results depending on the number of paths available to road users.</br>
