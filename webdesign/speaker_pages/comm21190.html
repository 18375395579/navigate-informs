Title: A Stochastic Programming Model for Casualty Response Planning during Catastrophic Health Events<br>Author: Aakil Caunhye, PhD Student, Nanyang Technological University, 758, Choa Chu Kang North 5, Singapore, 680758, Singapore, M090028@e.ntu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Xiaofeng Nie<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Catastrophic health events are natural or man-made incidents that create casualties in numbers that overwhelm healthcare response capabilities. We construct a three-stage stochastic programming model to locate alternative care facilities and transport casualties in response to such events. We also propose an L-shaped cut algorithm, to generate good solutions fast. We analyse the model and algorithm in the case of a high-impact earthquake in a subregion of San Bernardino, California.
