We construct a three-stage stochastic programming model to locate alternative care facilities and transport casualties in response to such events. We also propose an L-shaped cut algorithm, to generate good solutions fast. We analyse the model and algorithm in the case of a high-impact earthquake in a subregion of San Bernardino, California.</br>
