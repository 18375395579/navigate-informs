We present a numerical method for the simulation of the dynamics of an atmospheric aerosol particle.  An implicit discretization scheme for the ordinary differential equations is coupled with a primal-dual interior-point method for the optimization problem.  Extension is presented when considering a sequence of optimization problems coupled with differential equations.</br>
