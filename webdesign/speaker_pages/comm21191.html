Title: Interior-point Methods for Nonlinear Dynamic Optimization<br>Author: Alexandre Caboussat, Assistant Professor, University of Houston, 4800 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX, 77204-3008, United States, caboussat@math.uh.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Dynamic optimization problems arise when coupling a constrained optimization problem with ordinary differential equations.  We present a numerical method for the simulation of the dynamics of an atmospheric aerosol particle.  An implicit discretization scheme for the ordinary differential equations is coupled with a primal-dual interior-point method for the optimization problem.  Extension is presented when considering a sequence of optimization problems coupled with differential equations.
