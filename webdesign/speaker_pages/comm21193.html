Title: Relabeling Algorithm for Improving Prediction Quality<br>Author: Shital Shah, Assistant Professor, Rush University Medical Center, 1700 W.

It emphasizes knowledge generalization and confidence rather than classification accuracy. The proposed approach was successfully tested on the standard benchmark Pima Indians Diabetes dataset as well as bladder cancer immunotherapy data.
