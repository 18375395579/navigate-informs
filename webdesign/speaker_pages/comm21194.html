Title: Clique Generalizations and Clusters in Biological Networks<br>Author: Balabhaskar Balasundaram, Assistant Professor, Industrial Engineering & Management, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States, baski.balasundaram@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sergiy Butenko<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Networks such as protein interaction networks and gene co-expression networks play important roles in systems biology. Cliques and quasi-cliques have been most popular as cluster models in this area. In this talk, we will discuss why graph theoretic clique generalizations from social network analysis provide interesting alternatives to the existing approaches. We present our mathematical programming approaches to finding such clique generalizations and preliminary numerical results.
