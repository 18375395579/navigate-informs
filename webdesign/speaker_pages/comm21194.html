Cliques and quasi-cliques have been most popular as cluster models in this area. In this talk, we will discuss why graph theoretic clique generalizations from social network analysis provide interesting alternatives to the existing approaches. We present our mathematical programming approaches to finding such clique generalizations and preliminary numerical results.</br>
