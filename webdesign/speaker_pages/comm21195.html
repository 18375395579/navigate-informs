<br>Title: A Smooth Perceptron - von Neumann Algorithm</br><br>Author: Negar Soheili, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, nsoheili@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Javier Peña</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The perceptron and von Neumann algorithms for solving linear programming feasibility problems have attracted attention due to their simplicity and popularity in machine learning. A major limitation of these algorithms is that they exhibit slow convergence. We overcome this limitation by developing a procedure that combines smooth versions of these algorithms and retains their original simplicity. Further, we generalize it to solve conic systems.</br>
