Title: Open Constraints in a Closed World<br>Author: Willem-Jan van Hoeve, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, vanhoeve@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Charles Régin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Open constraints are defined on a flexible set of variables and appear, e.g., in the context of task scheduling on alternative resources. We present efficient domain filtering algorithms for the open global cardinality constraint, and for conjunctions of them, by integrating network flow techniques. The algorithms filter the scope of the open constraint, as well as the domains of the variables on which it is eventually defined.
