Title: Parallel Global Optimization using an Improved Multi-points Expected Improvement Criterion<br>Author: Peter Frazier, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, 106 Burleigh Dr, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, pf98@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Scott Clark<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In the context of parallel global optimization with a Gaussian process prior, we consider the multi-points criterion proposed by Ginsbourger, Le Riche, and Carraro (2008).  While this criterion is conceptually appealing, optimizing it to create an algorithm is difficult.  Using stochastic approximation, we show how to optimize the multi-points criterion efficiently, and demonstrate that the resulting algorithm provides a speedup over the single-threaded expected improvement algorithm.
