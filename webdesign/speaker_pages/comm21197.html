While this criterion is conceptually appealing, optimizing it to create an algorithm is difficult.  Using stochastic approximation, we show how to optimize the multi-points criterion efficiently, and demonstrate that the resulting algorithm provides a speedup over the single-threaded expected improvement algorithm.</br>
