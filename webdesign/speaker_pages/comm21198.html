The advantage of using optimization techniques for solving decision tree problems, as opposed to using (traditional) backward recursion or stochastic dynamic programming methods is illustrated. Next, we extend this basic characterization to a compact path-based formulation and design a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm for solving this problem. Finally, we present some preliminary computational results.</br>
