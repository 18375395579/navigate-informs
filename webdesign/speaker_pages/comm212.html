Title: Random Search Methods for Continuous Simulation Optimization<br>Author: Andrei Prudius, Ph.D Student, Georgia Tech., Stewart School of ISyE, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, aprudius@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present several random search methods for solving continuous parameter simulation optimization problems. We show that our methods are globally convergent with probability one, and also provide some numerical results that demonstrate the performance of the proposed approaches.
