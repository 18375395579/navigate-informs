Title: Elimination Algorithm for Integer Binary Inequalities<br>Author: Chendong Li, Texas Tech University, Compter Science Department, 8th & Boston, Lubbock, TX, 79409, United States of America, chendong.li@ttu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yuanlin Zhang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The problem of solving inequalities involving two variables  has been studied in both the Constraint Programming and  the Mathematical Programming community. In this paper, we present a new simple algorithm on solving those inequalities with integer variables.  The algorithm is based on the idea of Motzkin Elimination on real  variables and a new representation of an inequality.
