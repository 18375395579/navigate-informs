The problem is formulated as a two-stage recourse model where randomness in generation, transmission lines, and loads are considered. Reliability index is the expected cost of load loss as it incorporates duration and magnitude of load loss. Sample-average approximation technique, using Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube sampling, is employed. The method is tested on an actual twelve-area power system.</br>
