Title: Representability of Disjunctive Cuts for Mixed-integer Nonlinear Programming<br>Author: Sina Modaresi, University of Pittsburgh, 3700 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, United States of America, sim23@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Kilinc, Juan Pablo Vielma<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the convex hull of the union of disjunctive nonlinear sets. In many cases there are extended formulations for the convex hull; however, it is not clear if the projection of such formulations belongs to the same class as the original sets. We show that for some classes of sets, the convex hull of the union of two disjunctive nonlinear sets belongs to the same class as the original sets.
