<br>Title: Creative Problem Solving as a Stochastic Search Problem</br><br>Author: Christian Terwiesch, Professor, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, terwiesch@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karl Ulrich, Karan Girotra</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a framework of problemsolving in settings of innovation, product development, and design. We show how problem solving can be seen as a stochastic search problem in which the solver takes draws from some underlying performance function. Based on several experiments, we establish the shape of the underlying performance function and discuss different problem solving approaches.</br>
