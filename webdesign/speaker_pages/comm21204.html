Title: Sequential Convex Approximations of Chance Constrained Programs<br>Author: Jeff Hong, Assistant Professor, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, China, hongl@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Yi Yang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Chance constrained programs are difficult to solve due to the nonconvexity of the chance function. n this talk, we proposed to approximate the problem by a sequence of convex programs. We show that the sequence leads to a local optimal solution to the original problem, and the solution is provable better than the solution found by the CVaR approximation. We solve the sequence of convex programs using the Monte Carlo method.
