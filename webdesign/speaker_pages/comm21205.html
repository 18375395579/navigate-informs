Title: Monotone Covering Problems with an Additional Covering Constraint<br>Author: Jose Rafael Correa, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile, joser.correa@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Asaf Levin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We provide preliminary results regarding the existence of a polynomial time approximation scheme for minimizing a linear function over a 0/1 covering polytope which is integral, with one additional covering constraint. Our algorithm is based on extending the methods of Goemans and Ravi for the constrained minimum spanning tree problem and implies the existence of a PTAS for a variety of integer programming problems with a totally unimodular constraint matrix.
