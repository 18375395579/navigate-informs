Title: Appointment Scheduling with Limited Distributional Information<br>Author: Jiawei Zhang, Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, NY, United States of America, jzhang@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ho-Yin Mak, Ying Rong<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper, we develop distribution-free models that solve the appointment scheduling and sequencing problems by assuming only moments information. In the special case where the first two marginal moments are given, the problem can be reformulated as a second-order cone program. Based on the structural properties of the two-moment model, we prove that, under a mild condition, it is optimal to sequence jobs in increasing order of duration variance.
