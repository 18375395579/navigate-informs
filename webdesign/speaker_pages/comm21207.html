Title: Challenges in Exact Linear and Integer Programming: Exact Precision Linear Algebra<br>Author: Dan Steffy, Georgia Institute of Technology, dsteffy@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Cook<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A successful approach to solving linear programming problems exactly has been to solve the problems with increasing levels of fixed precision, checking the final basis in exact arithmetic and then doing additional pivots if necessary.  This work is a computational study comparing different techniques for the core element of our exact computation: solving sparse rational systems of linear equations exactly.
