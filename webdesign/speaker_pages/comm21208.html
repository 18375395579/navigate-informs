Title: Cutting Plane Approach for Facility Location Problems with Binary First- and Second-Stage Variables<br>Author: John Penuel, Graduate Student, University of Florida, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32607, United States of America, jpenuel@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a stochastic scenario-based facility location problem. The first-stage variables are traditional binary facility location variables. Second-stage recourse variables include binary facility activation variables (limited to those facilities located in the first stage), and flow variables from activated facilities to demands. We derive L-shaped cutting planes from the recourse solutions to each MIP subproblem, and compare our method to the integer L-shaped method of Laporte and Louveaux.
