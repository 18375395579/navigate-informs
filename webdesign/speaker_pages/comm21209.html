<br>Title: Modeling and Solving an Integrated Workforce-Equipment-Production Planning Problem</br><br>Author: Gang Li, Assistant Professor, Bentley University, 175 Forest Street, Waltham, MA, 02452, United States of America, gli@bentley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tian He, Hongxun Jiang, Youming Pang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We built an optimization model to assist a company to make integrated decisions on equipment purchasing, workforce recruiting and training, and production scheduling.  A genetic algorithm based decomposition approach, combing with preprocessing and network optimization, was shown effective in solving this large scale problem.</br>
