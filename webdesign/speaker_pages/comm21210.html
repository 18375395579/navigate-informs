Title: A Two-echelon Inventory-location Problem with Service Considerations<br>Author: Ho-Yin Mak, University of California, Berkeley, 1117 Etcheverry Hall, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, makho@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Max Shen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the design of a two-echelon spare parts inventory system with stochastic demand and service constraints. Facility location and inventory management decisions are jointly optimized using a mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation. We will discuss the proposed solution algorithm, computational results and some managerial insights.
