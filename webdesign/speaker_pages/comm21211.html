Title: Selecting a Small Set of Diverse Solutions to Mixed Integer Programming Problems<br>Author: David Woodruff, Professor, University of California, GSM, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA, 95616, United States, dlwoodruff@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Emilie Danna<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: When solving a mixed-integer programming model, it is useful to obtain  multiple feasible solutions of good quality rather than just one  optimal solution. However, it is often impractical in applications to  make use of a very large number of solutions. Instead, a small set of  diverse solutions is more valuable. Given an oracle that generates a  large number of solutions (CPLEX), we introduce several algorithms to  select a small subset of solutions with high diversity.
