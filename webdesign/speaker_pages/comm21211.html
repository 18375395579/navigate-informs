However, it is often impractical in applications to  make use of a very large number of solutions. Instead, a small set of  diverse solutions is more valuable. Given an oracle that generates a  large number of solutions (CPLEX), we introduce several algorithms to  select a small subset of solutions with high diversity.</br>
