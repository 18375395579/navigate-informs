Title: Diversity Enhancing Evolutionary Multiobjective Search<br>Author: Brian Piper, North Carolina State University, 2500 Stinson Drive, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, bepiper@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ranji Ranjithan, Hana Chmielewski<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Besides obtaining Pareto-optimal solutions, decision diversity is an important consideration in real-world multiobjective problems. Diversity can be defined as both the spread of solutions in the decision space and degree to which alternative solutions are available. We present algorithms for obtaining diverse Pareto-optimal sets and compare results for several test problems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.
