Title: Airline Performance Over Time<br>Author: Dipasis Bhadra, MITRE/CAASD, 7515 Colshire Avenue, McLean, VA, 22102, United States, dbhadra@mitre.org<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present airline performance using a quantitative benchmarking method. The Data Envelopment Analysis allows us to benchmark the best performing airline and determine the relative efficiencies of individual members (called decision making unit) within a group consisting of both legacy carriers and LCCs. This non-parametric approach compares each DMU airline with only the best DMU airline. This method brings the performance comparison closer to reality than traditional parametric methods.
