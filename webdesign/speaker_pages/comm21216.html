<br>Title: A Case Study of Ambulance Location and Relocation</br><br>Author: Rahul Nair, Graduate Assistant, Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, rahul@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elise Miller-Hooks</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We solve a multi-objective, integer program to assess whether or not there is significant benefit in relocating ambulances. A relocation strategy involves repositioning ambulances in response to an emergency call or in anticipation of future demand. We present methodology to overcome practical issues in solving a real-world optimization problem and results from simulation runs to test output strategies.</br>
