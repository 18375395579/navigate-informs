Title: Randomized Algorithms for Geometric Set Cover<br>Author: Ken Clarkson, Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, 600 Mountain Avenue, Room 2C-526, Murray Hill, NJ, 07974, United States, clarkson@research.bell-labs.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: While in general the set cover problem is hard to approximate, in the geometric setting it is possible, for a large class of problems, to obtain constant-factor approximations.  I will describe an approach to do this, by applying random sampling to solve one particular easy version of the problem, that of finding epsilon-nets, and then to leverage that solution to greater generality.  Applications include covering a region with disks and guarding simple terrains.    Joint with K. Varadarajan.
