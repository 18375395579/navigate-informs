Title: Practically Efficient Algorithms for Contingency-constrained Unit Commitment<br>Author: Richard Chen, Senior Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 969 MS 9155, Livermore, CA, 94551, United States of America, rlchen@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Paul Watson, Neng Fan, Ali Pinar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing generation unit commitment under load uncertainty while ensuring N-k-\epsilon reliability. We present cutting plane algorithms for solving this problem.  But rather than explicitly considering all possible contingencies, we use bilevel separation problems to quickly identify violated contingencies. We also explore a more efficient separation problem that identifies violated cut-set inequalities associated with a simplified transmission model.
