Title: A Bundle Gradient Sampling Algorithm for Nonsmooth Optimization<br>Author: Xiaocun Que, Lehigh University, 14 Duh DR, APT 323, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, xiq209@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Frank Curtis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving nonsmooth optimization problems. The objective function may be nonsmooth and/or nonconvex. The method is based on bundle methods and the gradient sampling algorithm (GS). Preliminary results show that our algorithm yields benefits over GS. We will discuss the global convergence properties of the method.
