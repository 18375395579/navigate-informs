Title: A Sequential Linear Programming Algorithm for Portfolio Optimization<br>Author: Srinivas Bollapragada, GE Global Research Center, 1 Research Circle, Schenectady, NY, United States, bollapragada@research.ge.com<br>Coauthor(s): Kete Chalermkraivuth<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In asset-liability management (ALM) situations, portfolio managers attempt to maximize return and minimize risk while matching the risk characteristics of assets with those of the liabilities. The ALM problem can be formulated as a traditional Markowitz model with side constraints. For real world problems with thousands of assets, it is not possible to generate the portfolio efficient frontier in a reasonable time. We developed and patented a novel, sequential linear programming algorithm that can generate the efficient frontier for real world problems in a few minutes. Our algorithm is currently being used to manage assets worth over $80 billion.
