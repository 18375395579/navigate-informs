It is  known that the facets of the convex hull of a multilinear on a box  can be obtained by solving an LP. However, the size of this LP grows exponentially with the number of variables. We propose a decomposition scheme to decompose a multilinear to low dimensional components, for which this LP can be solved efficiently. We embed this cut generation strategy at every node of BARON, and present results on variety of problems.
