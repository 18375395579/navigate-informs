Title: Higher-rank Order Semidefinite Cuts for Quadratic and Polynomial Programming Problems<br>Author: Jitamitra Desai, Assistant professor, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, Singapore, jdesai@ntu.edu.sg<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Given an RLT-based LP relaxation, along with imposing nonnegativity on the RLT product variables, PSD constraints on suitable dyadic variable-product matrices can also be used to derive implied semidefinite cuts. Previously known cuts are generated using coefficient matrices of rank one. Here, we present a cut generation algorithm for higher-rank order semidefinite cuts based on a congruent transformation scheme. Numerical examples will be used to illustrate the proposed cutting plane strategy.
