Title: Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming Using Interior-point Methods<br>Author: Hande Benson, Assistant Professor, Drexel University, 3141 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, hvb22@drexel.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We outline a bilevel approach for solving mixed integer nonlinear  programming problems, combining a branch-and-bound algorithm in the  outer iterations and an infeasible interior-point method in the inner iterations.  We report on implementation details, including efficient pruning of the branch-and-bound tree via equilibrium constraints, warmstart strategies for interior-point methods, and handling of infeasible subproblems, and present numerical results.
