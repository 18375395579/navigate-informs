Jones</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a mixed-integer linear program for solving a combinatorial problem that arises from a novel electronic fabric architecture. The problem entails the mapping of a data flow graph represented as an acyclic directed graph onto a particular implementation of the architecture. For this problem, finding feasible solutions is a challenge. We present modeling and algorithmic enhancements that were necessary to make the problem tractable.</br>
