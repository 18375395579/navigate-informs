Title: Mapping Onto a Flexible Low-power Electronic Fabric Architecture<br>Author: Mustafa Baz, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, mub3@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brady Hunsaker, Gayatri Mehta, Justin Stander, Alex K. Jones<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a mixed-integer linear program for solving a combinatorial problem that arises from a novel electronic fabric architecture. The problem entails the mapping of a data flow graph represented as an acyclic directed graph onto a particular implementation of the architecture. For this problem, finding feasible solutions is a challenge. We present modeling and algorithmic enhancements that were necessary to make the problem tractable.
