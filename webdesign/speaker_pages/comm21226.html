Title: Recent Advances in Geometric Programming<br>Author: Seung-Jean Kim, Consulting Assistant Professor, Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, 223 Packard, 350 Serra Mall, Palo Alto, CA, 94305, United States, sjkim@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kwangmoo Koh, Stephen Boyd<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Geometric programming has been known since the 1970s. Recently developed solution methods can solve large-scale geometric program (GPs) extremely efficiently and reliably. At the same time, a large number of practical problems in several fields including circuit design and machine learning have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) GPs. We give a brief overview of the new applications of GP and recent advances in solving large-scale GPs.
