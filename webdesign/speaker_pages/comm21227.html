<br>Title: A Unified Theorem on SDP Rank Reduction</br><br>Author: Anthony Man-Cho So, Stanford University, 51 Dudley Ln, Apt 404, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, manchoso@cs.stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a low-rank approximate solution to a system of linear equations in symmetric, positive semidefinite matrices.  We show that a simple randomized polynomial-time procedure produces a low-rank solution that has provably good approximation qualities.  Our result provides a unified treatment of and generalizes several well-known results in the literature.</br>
