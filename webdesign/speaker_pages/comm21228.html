Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, nadia.martinezcepeda@mavs.uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger, Victoria C Chen, Diana Martinez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research presents a branch-and-bound algorithm to optimize a non-convex piecewise linear function generated by a modified version of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) subject to constraints that include both linear regression models and piecewise linear MARS models. The method proposed is illustrated in an automotive crash safety system design case study and compared with an evolutionary optimization algorithm.</br>
