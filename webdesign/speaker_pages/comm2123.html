Title: A Dual Approach to Singular Stochastic Control Problems<br>Author: Sunil Kumar, Professor of Operations, Information, and Technology, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305-5015, United States, Kumar_Sunil@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joy Rajiv<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Singular stochastic control problems arise in a variety of applications ranging from economics to finance to queueing systems. Except in special cases, these problems can only be solved numerically. We outline a numerical method based on duality for solving such problems. We iteratively construct dual feasible solutions, by modifying the cost structure, that approach the primal optimal solution. We illustrate the method on two well-known problems.
