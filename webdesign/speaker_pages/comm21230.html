Reduced-space approaches attempt to counter this by reducing the number of variables branched on, e.g., by using equality constraints to define implicit functions. In light of the cluster effect, it is important to bound their range using methods that have quadratic convergence order. Here, we present recent  advances designed with this key property in mind.</br>
