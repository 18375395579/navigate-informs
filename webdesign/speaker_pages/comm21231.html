Title: Effects of Risk Preferences on Network Design Decision<br>Author: Yueyue Fan, Assistant Professor, University of California, Department of Civil Engineering, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, yyfan@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Changzheng Liu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper investigates the impacts of different stochastic modeling approaches on the design strategies for network expansion problem under demand uncertainty.  Three stochastic models with numerical case studies will be presented, including a stochastic programming model targeting minimum expected system cost, a mean-risk stochastic programming model that balances between expectation and controlling risk, and a robust optimization model emphasizing on the worst case cost.
