Title: An Approximate Dynamic Programming Method for Scheduling of a Chemotherapy Infusion Center<br>Author: Timothy Hopper, North Carolina State University, 400 Daniels Hall, College of Engineering, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, tdhopper@ncsu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Chemotherapy infusion clinics can have fifty or more chairs where patients come to receive one-to-eight hour treatments. Uncertainty in treatment durations, and nurse availability, makes real time appointment scheduling decisions a challenge. We formulate a stochastic dynamic programming model for this problem and we compare approximate dynamic programming methods for solving this problem. Results are presented based on empirical data from a large cancer hospital.
