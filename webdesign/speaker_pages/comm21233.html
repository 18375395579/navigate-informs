Title: Biorefinery Supply Chain Network Design under Uncertainty and Evaluation of the Impacts of Policies<br>Author: Narges Kazemzadeh, Iowa State University, 3030 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, kazemzad@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guiping Hu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The goal of this study is to design a biofuel supply chain considering uncertainty in feedstock yield, fuel market price and logistic costs. To deal with the stochastic parameters, we develop two-stage stochastic programming models in which Conditional Value at Risk is considered as a risk measure to control shortage of demand. We also investigate the impacts of policies on the proposed models. A case study in Iowa is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the models.
