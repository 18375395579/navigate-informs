Title: Solution Strategies for Flexible Discrete Location Models<br>Author: Stefan Nickel, Chair of Operations Research and Logistics, Saarland University, Geb A 5 3, Saarland, SL, 66041, Germany, s.nickel@orl.uni-saarland.de<br>Coauthor(s): Sebastian Velten, Alfredo Marin, Justo Puerto<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Ordered Median problems deal, in contrast to classical location problems, with objective functions which are pointwise defined. Nearly all classical objective functions from location theory have an ordered median representation. Moreover, new objective functions can be modeled. We give a new, mixed-integer formulation of the discrete Ordered Median Problem (DOMP). A Branch-and-Cut scheme will be presented and computational results will be reported. Moreover, extensions will be discussed.
