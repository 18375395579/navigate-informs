Title: ASTRAL: An Active-Set Trust-Region Algorithm for Box Constrained Optimization<br>Author: Liang Xu, University of Washington, Box 354350, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, lxu@math.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jim Burke<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: An algorithm for solving large nonlinear optimization problems with simple bounds is described. The algorithm is in the framework of a Quasi-Newton active-set trust-region method. The local active set is identified using projected gradients.  Limited memory curvature estimate is used and exploited in solving the  trust-region sub-problems.  A restart strategy ensures that the algorithm indentifies the optimal constraints in finite number iterations.
