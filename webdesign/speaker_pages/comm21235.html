The algorithm is in the framework of a Quasi-Newton active-set trust-region method. The local active set is identified using projected gradients.  Limited memory curvature estimate is used and exploited in solving the  trust-region sub-problems.  A restart strategy ensures that the algorithm indentifies the optimal constraints in finite number iterations.</br>
