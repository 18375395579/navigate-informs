We developed a spatial stochastic programming formulation to model fire spread, intensity and suppression activities. Solutions to the model suggest optimal suppression activities for a known ignition given a probability distribution of random weather scenarios. The formulation is designed to handle multi-objective fire policies where portions of a fire may be allowed to spread and other portions are contained.</br>
