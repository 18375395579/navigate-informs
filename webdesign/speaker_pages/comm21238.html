Title: Piecewise Linear Optimization with COIN-OR<br>Author: Ismael de Farias, Assistant Professor, SUNY Buffalo, 403 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, defarias@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ming Zhao, Justin Yates, Hongxia Zhao<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Any nonlinear optimization problem can be approximated to an arbitrary degree of accuracy as a piecewise linear optimization problem (PLOP). We discuss modeling and a branch-and-cut approach to continuous and discontinuous PLOP. We discuss the implementation of our theory in COIN-OR and we present computational results.
