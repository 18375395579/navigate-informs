<br>Title: Core-pricing in Large Multi-object Auctions: A Market Design for Selling TV Ads</br><br>Author: Robert Day, Associate Professor, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Road, U-1041, Storrs, CT, 06269-1041, United States of America, bob.day@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pasha Shabalin, Andor Goetzendorff, Martin Bichler</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by markets for television advertising time-slots, we introduce a new combinatorial auction format, including a general method for approximating core-selecting payments for hard problems which can be solved approximately. Our adaptation of the core-selecting payment technique to this environment of nearly-optimal optimization results is a new, practically viable paradigm by which competitive market outcomes can be achieved despite computational limitations.</br>
