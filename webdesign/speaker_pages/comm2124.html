In this paper, it is defined as the crane sequencing problem (CSP). It is closely related to some variants of the traveling salesman problem. The CSP is a unique problem with many applications and is computationally intractable. In this paper, a mathematical model and hybrid ant systems are developed to solve CSPs.
