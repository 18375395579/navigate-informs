Bennett, Gautam Kunapuli, Jing Hu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk presents a parameter-free integer-programming based algorithm for the global resolution of a linear program with linear complementarity constraints (LPEC). The cornerstone of the algorithm is a minimax integer program formulation that characterizes and provides certificates for the three outcomes---infeasibility, unboundedness, or solvability---of an LPEC. Computational results demonstrate that the algorithm can handle infeasible, unbounded, and solvable LPECs effectively.
