Title: Stochastic Optimization of a Biomass-to-Biofuel Supply Chain under Multiple Uncertainties<br>Author: Atif Osmani, Graduate Research Assistant, North Dakota State University, Industrial Engineering Dept., CIE Building, Fargo, ND, 58102, United States of America, Atif.Osmani@my.ndsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A biomass-to-biofuel supply chain is studied under multiple uncertainties in supply, demand and prices. An integrated two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize the supply chain logistics decisions to maximize the expected profit by considering constraints over the full range of the uncertain environment. Decomposition technique is used to make the stochastic problem computationally tractable and to obtain optimal solutions within reasonable time frame.
