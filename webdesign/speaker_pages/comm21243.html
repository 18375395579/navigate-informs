Title: Optimization of Outpatient Appointment Scheduling Systems with Uncertainty in Patient Demand<br>Author: S. Ayca Erdogan, North Carolina State University, Graduate Program in Operations Research, 375 Daniels Hall, Campus Box 7906, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, saerdoga@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk, we focus on finding optimal appointment schedules when there is uncertainty in the load on a stochastic server. This has important applications to healthcare delivery systems with uncertainty in patient no-shows and short notice demand from urgent or emergent patients. We describe a two-stage Stochastic Linear Programming formulation, decomposition methods for solving it, and numerical results based on real data.
