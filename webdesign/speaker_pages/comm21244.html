Title: Sampling Approaches for Optimization with Probabilistic Constraints<br>Author: Jim Luedtke, Georgia Institute of Tech., jluedtke@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Ahmed, George Nemhauser<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study Monte Carlo sampling approaches for obtaining approximate solutions to optimization problems with probabilistic constraints.  We show how sample approximation problems can be used to obtain feasible solutions and optimality bounds, without requiring the nominal optimizatio problem to be convex.  We also study the rates of convergence of the approximations.
