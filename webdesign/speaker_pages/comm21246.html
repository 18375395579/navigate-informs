The software's modular design and extensible structure facilitates rigorous validation of promising approaches and further development of novel ensemble methods. We demonstrate preliminary results on protein mass spectrometry data. Future work will include parallel implementation and techniques for scaling ensemble learning to large datasets.</br>
