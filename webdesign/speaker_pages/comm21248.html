Title: Extracting from the Conventional for the Semi-continuous Variable Efficient Frontier<br>Author: Ralph E. Steuer, Professor, University of Georgia, Department of Finance, Brooks Hall, Athens, GA, 30602, United States of America, rsteuer@uga.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Given the (a) speed at which the efficient frontier of a conventional portfolio selection problem can now be computed and (b) likelihood that a conventional efficient frontier will have overlaps with the efficient frontier of the same problem but with semi-continuous variables, this paper investigates the time savings that can be achieved when constructing semi-continuous variable efficient frontiers when exploiting these observations.
