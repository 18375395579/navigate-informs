Title: A Semidefinite Optimization Approach to Space-free Multi-row Facility Layout<br>Author: Miguel F.

Large single-row problems have been solved to global optimality using semidefinite optimization. We extend the approach to space-free multi-row layout and show that if provides high-quality bounds in reasonable time.
