<br>Title: Real-time Optimization of Complex Energy Systems on High-performance Computers</br><br>Author: Cosmin Petra, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, United States of America, petra@mcs.anl.gov</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic optimization of complex energy systems results in extremely large optimization problems that can be solved only by means of high-performance computing (HPC). We present the latest algorithmic and implementation developments within our solver parallel PIPS that are aimed at reducing the solution times and solving stochastic economic dispatch and unit commitment problems in real-time on HPC platforms. We also present numerical experiments on IBM BG/P, Cray XK7 and XC30  architectures.</br>
