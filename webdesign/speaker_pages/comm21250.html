<br>Title: A Robust Optimization Approach for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control with Emission Constraints</br><br>Author: Hongcheng Liu, PhD Candidate, Pennsylvania State University, 240 Leonhard, University Park, PA, United States of America, hql5143@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tao Yao, Ke Han, Terry Friesz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider an adaptive signal control problem using the LWR model, with vehicle emission side constraints. We uncover, through numerical simulation, certain relationship between macroscopic traffic and emission quantities. Such relationship is combined with robust optimization techniques to reduce the problem to a mixed integer linear program, efficiently solvable with standard software.</br>
