<br>Title: A Framework for a Self Healing Assembly System</br><br>Author: Jaime Camelio, Assistant Professor, Michigan Technological University, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 815 R.L. Smith ME-EM Building, Houghton, MI, 49931, United States of America, jcamelio@mtu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Advances in statistical process monitoring and control have focused primarily on more efficient ways to diagnosis faults, reducing variation, developing robust design techniques, and increasing sensor capabilities. System level advances are largely dependent on the introduction of new techniques in the listed areas. A unique system level manufacturing process is introduced in this paper as a means to integrate rapidly advancing computing technology and analysis methods.</br>
