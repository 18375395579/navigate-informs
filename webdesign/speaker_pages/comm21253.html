Title: On the Computational Complexity of Quadratic Integer Programming<br>Author: Diego Alejandro Moran Ramirez, Georgia Institute of Technology, 225 North Ave NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, dmoran@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vishnu Narayanan, Santanu Dey<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A Convex Quadratic Integer Program (CQIP) is the optimization problem of minimizing a linear function subject to m convex quadratic constraints, where all the data is defined by rational numbers. In this talk, we show (under some sufficient conditions) that if (CQIP) has an optimal solution, then there exists an optimal solution of size bounded by a polynomial in the size of the data defining the problem, when the number of constraints is fixed.
