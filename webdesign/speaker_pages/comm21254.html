Our prototypical example is a trust-region type method adapted to solve simulation optimization problems, where function values at each step are replaced by function estimates obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Within such contexts, we trade-off the deterministic error due to recursion with the ``stochastic error due to sampling.</br>
