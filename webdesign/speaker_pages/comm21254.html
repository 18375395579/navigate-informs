Title: Sampling within Algorithmic Recursions<br>Author: Raghu Pasupathy, Associate Professor, Virginia Tech, 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, pasupath@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fatemeh Hashemi, Soumyadip Ghosh<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the context of algorithmic recursions that involve quantities that need to be estimated using simulation. Our prototypical example is a trust-region type method adapted to solve simulation optimization problems, where function values at each step are replaced by function estimates obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Within such contexts, we trade-off the deterministic error due to recursion with the ``stochastic error due to sampling.
