Title: A New Approach to Hotel Pricing<br>Author: Dan Zhang, University of Colorado at Boulder, 995 Regent Dr, Boulder, CO, United States of America, dan.zhang@colorado.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Weatherford<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We show that a non-linear non-separable approximation architecture proposed in the recent work of Zhang (2011) can be generalized to dynamic pricing for network revenue management. This generalization leads to tighter bounds and better heuristic policies than widely used DAVN type approaches. We provide a case study with data from a major US hotel.
