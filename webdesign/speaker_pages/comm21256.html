Professor, Princeton University, Olden St, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, aspremon@princeton.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We derive two stochastic gradient algorithms for semidefinite optimization using randomization techniques. One is based on the robust stochastic approximation method and uses random sparsifications of the current iterate to both accelerate eigenvalue computations and reduce memory requirements. The other relies on gradient sampling techniques to reduce the per iteration cost of smooth semidefinite optimization methods.</br>
