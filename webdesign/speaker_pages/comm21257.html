<br>Title: Linear Complementarity Problems: Matrix Classes, Algorithms and EP-theorems</br><br>Author: Tibor Illes, Associate Professor, Eotvos Lorand University, Pázmány Péter Sétány 1/C,, Budapest, Hungary, illes@cs.elte.hu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we compare pivot and interior point algorithms for different classes of linear complementarity problems (LCP).Using duality theorem of LCP in EP-form, we generalize our algorithms in the following way: we start to solve LCP, without apriori information about the property of the matrix (sufficiency, bisymmetricity, positive definitness) . We either solve the LCP problem, or solve its dual problem, or give a certificate that the input matrix is not sufficient.</br>
