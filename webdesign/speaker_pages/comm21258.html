Title: Pricing, Location and Capacity Planning with Elastic Demand and Congestion<br>Author: Oded Berman, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, Berman@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca<br>Coauthor(s): Dmitry Krass<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a general version of the stochastic location model with pricing and congestion.  Customer demand is elastic in price, travel distance and waiting time; We consider single and multi-facility models with general service discipline, establishing properties including nodal optimality, and (under certain conditions) separability between pricing and locational decisions. This allows us to develop efficient exact optimal solution algorithms.
