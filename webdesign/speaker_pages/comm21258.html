Customer demand is elastic in price, travel distance and waiting time; We consider single and multi-facility models with general service discipline, establishing properties including nodal optimality, and (under certain conditions) separability between pricing and locational decisions. This allows us to develop efficient exact optimal solution algorithms.</br>
