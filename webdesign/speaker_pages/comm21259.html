We extend the this policy to a broader class of prior distributions by introducing the generalized linear model(GLM). GLM unifies various statistical models, such as linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression. With proper sampling methods and numerical integration, we demonstrate that the knowledge-gradient algorithm for GLM is efficient.</br>
