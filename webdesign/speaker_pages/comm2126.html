In our problem setting, we have for each node, except the depot, a known demand, a fixed service duration and a soft time window. Our objective is to minimize the sum of transportation costs and service costs. We apply a column generation procedure to solve our model. To generate an integer solution, we embed our column generation procedure within a branch-and-price method.
