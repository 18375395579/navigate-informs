Title: A Link-node Formulation for Dynamic Congestion Pricing<br>Author: Xuegan (Jeff) Ban, Assistant Research Engineer, CCIT, University of California, Berkeley, 2105 Bancroft Way, Berkeley, CA, United States, xban@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Henry Liu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We formulate the dynamic congestion pricing as a bi-level problem. We then establish the solution existence condition for such a model, independent of the actual formulation of the underlying dynamic user equilibria.  By applying the link-node dynamic user-equilibrium model we proposed recently, the toll pricing problem can be converted into a single level nonlinear programming problem defined on the decision variable and the destination-specific link inflows.
