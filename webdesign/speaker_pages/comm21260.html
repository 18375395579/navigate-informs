We then establish the solution existence condition for such a model, independent of the actual formulation of the underlying dynamic user equilibria.  By applying the link-node dynamic user-equilibrium model we proposed recently, the toll pricing problem can be converted into a single level nonlinear programming problem defined on the decision variable and the destination-specific link inflows.</br>
