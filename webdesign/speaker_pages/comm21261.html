Title: Competing output-sensitive frame algorithms for DEA<br>Author: Jose Dula, Associate Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, School of Business, Richmond, VA, United States of America, jdula@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francisco Lopez<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Two output-sensitive procedures for identifying the extreme efficient DMUs (the ``frame)  of the PPS are currently available:  one by  Dula (2007) and the other based on  Ottmann et al. (2001). The two procedures are in dual spaces and differ enough to motivate the  question as to how they compare in a fair competition.   We derive an improved dualized version of the  procedure in Ottmann et al. and compare it to the one by Dula using a well-structured, large-scale, problem suite.
