<br>Title: Merging Process Operations and Financial Analysis to Enhance the Supply Chain Management</br><br>Author: Luis Puigjaner, Professor, Spain, luis.puigjaner@upc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gonzalo Guillén-Gosálbez, Jos?Miguel Laínez</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This work proposes a general framework for the design and retrofit of chemical supply chains which relies on the development of holistic models which merge process operations as well as financial variables and constraints. A mathematical formulation which utilizes mixed integer modeling techniques is derived and its advantages are highlighted through a case study in which a comparison with the traditional myopic approach, which neglects the financial side of the problem, is carried out.</br>
