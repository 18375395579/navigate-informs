<br>Title: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Models for Reliable System Design</br><br>Author: Kelly Sullivan, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, ksulliv@uark.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present an LP for computing the reliability of a broad class of systems consisting of independent components.  This model can be extended to address a number of questions arising in reliability.  To illustrate this, we extend the reliability-computing LP to derive a mixed integer linear program for the redundancy allocation problem.  We present a brief computational study to demonstrate the viability of this approach.</br>
