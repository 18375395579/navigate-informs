Title: Developing a Robust Model for Designing Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Systems<br>Author: Mehrdad Shahabi, PhD Student, West Virginia University, 1227 Pineview Dr, Morgantown, WV, 26505, United States of America, mehrdad.shahabi@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mohammad Sadra Sharifi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Emergency Medical Service (EMS) facilities are centers which should serve affected people after a large-scale disaster like natural disaster of large-scale terror attack. In this study, we present a mathematical model for designing EMS systems using robust optimization technique. This model can handle demand uncertainty and ensures that the designed system will work efficiently even if the worst-case scenario of demand happens.
