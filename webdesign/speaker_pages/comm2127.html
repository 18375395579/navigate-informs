Title: Optimization Software Class Libraries - An Update of Research<br>Author: Stefan Voss, Chair and Director of the Institute of Information Systems within the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, University of Hamburg, IWI, Von-Melle-Park 5, Hamburg, HG, 20146, Germany, stefan.voss@uni-hamburg.de<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Just as metaheuristics provide flexible and extensible methods of solving optimization problems, class libraries provide flexible and extensible building blocks for creating software to implement metaheuristics. We provide an update of research regarding class libraries and frameworks in the metaheuristics domain. This includes a survey of some of the more general metaheuristics class libraries and some examples of specific uses.
