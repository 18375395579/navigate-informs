Title: Full Regularization Path for Sparse Principal Component Analysis<br>Author: Alexandre d'Aspremont, Princeton University, E-Quad E424, Princeton, NJ, United States, aspremon@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francis Bach, Laurent El Ghaoui<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Given a sample covariance matrix, we examine the problem of maximizing the variance explained by a linear combination of the variables while constraining the number of nonzero coefficients in this combination. We formulate a greedy algorithm to compute a full set of good solutions in O(n^3). We then derive sufficient conditions for global optimality, which can be tested in O(n3). We detail applications to subset selection and compressed sensing.
