Title: Solving Multiple-runway Aircraft Sequencing Problems using Column Generation<br>Author: Farbod Farhadi, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 121 Presidents Dr, Room 230, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, ffarhadi@som.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ahmed Ghoniem<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We address mixed mode multiple-runway aircraft sequencing problems using a column generation approach. The pricing sub-problem is solved using dynamic programming and the approach is enhanced using acceleration features. Computational results are reported and discussed.
