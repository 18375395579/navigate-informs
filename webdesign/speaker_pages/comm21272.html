Title: An Integrated Approach for the Fleet Assignment, Aircraft Routing, and Crew Pairing Problem<br>Author: Shengzhi Shao, Virginia Tech, 250 Durham Hall (0118), BLACKSBURG, VA, 24061, United States of America, szshao@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hanif D. Sherali, Mohamed Haouari<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a novel formulation that integrates fleet assignment, aircraft routing, and crew pairing within a single mixed-integer linear program, and derive valid inequalities to further tighten the representation. A Benders decomposition-based solution approach is adopted together with several acceleration strategies. Computational results are presented using real-life data obtained from a major U.S. airline to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and to provide insights.
