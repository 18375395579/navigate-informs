Sherali, Mohamed Haouari</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a novel formulation that integrates fleet assignment, aircraft routing, and crew pairing within a single mixed-integer linear program, and derive valid inequalities to further tighten the representation. A Benders decomposition-based solution approach is adopted together with several acceleration strategies. Computational results are presented using real-life data obtained from a major U.S. airline to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and to provide insights.</br>
