Title: A Hybrid Decomposition/ Genetic Algorithm for Minimax-regret Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Helene Tokou, Student, The University of Iowa, Department of Computer Science, Iowa City, United States of America, htokou@engineering.uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dennis Bricker<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A minimax-regret stochastic program with binary first-stage  decisions is solved using a genetic algorithm, where the fitness function is an outer linearization of the maximum second-stage regret. This function is first approximated using cross-decomposition (a hybrid algorithm incorporating subproblems of Benders' decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation) and further refined during the GA. Computational experience is described.
