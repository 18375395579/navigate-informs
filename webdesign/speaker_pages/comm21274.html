<br>Title: Optimization of the Genetic Code and Gene Sequences for Translational Robustness</br><br>Author: Eugene Koonin, NCBI, NIH, koonin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The universal, standard genetic code table has a distinctly non-random structure, with similar amino acids often encoded by codons series that differ by a single amino acid substitution, typically, in the third or the first position of the codon. It has been repeatedly argued that this structure of the code results from selective optimization for translational robustness such that translational misreading has the minimal adverse effect. Indeed, it has been shown in several studies that the standard code is more robust than a substantial majority of random codes. However, it remains unclear how much evolution the standard code underwent, what is the level of optimization, and what is the likely starting point.   I describe a simulation analysis of evolution of the genetic code that leads to the conclusions that the universal code is a result of partial optimization of a random code for translational robustness. The reason the code is not fully optimized could be the trade-off between the beneficial effect of increasing robustness and the deleterious effect of codon series reassignment that becomes increasingly severe with growing complexity of the evolving system. Thus, evolution of the code can be represented as a combination of adaptation and frozen accident. In addition to the code, gene sequence evolution, in both coding and non-coding positions, is strongly affected by optimization for translational robustness. I will present a unifying conceptual outlook on this major factor of evolution.</br>
