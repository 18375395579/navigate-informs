Title: Determining Economic Maintenance Schedule for Interdependent Components<br>Author: Pattharin Sarutipand, Student, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, p-sarutipand@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pablo L. Durango-Cohen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Optimal group maintenance policies for a system of functionally interdependent components are considered. We formulate the problem as a constrained nonlinear mixed-integer programming. A heuristic method is proposed for coordinating maintenance schedules for the clusters of components. An example is given to illustrate the method.
