Title: A Linear Programming Algorithm for Steady-state Analysis of Reflected Brownian Motion<br>Author: Assaf Zeevi, Columbia University, NY, United States, assaf@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Denis Saure, Peter Glynn<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe a linear programming-based method for approximately solving   the steady-state distribution of RBM in the orthant. The method is based   on the basic adjoint relation and approximating the distribution (rather than the density) of the stationary measure.    Other applications of the method will be discussed as well.
