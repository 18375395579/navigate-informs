Title: A Local Branching based Decomposition Heuristic for Stochastic Programs<br>Author: Walter Rei, Professor, University of Quebec in Montreal, 315 St.Catherine Street East, Montreal, QC, H2X 3X2, Canada, rei.walter@uqam.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mike Hewitt, Teodor Gabriel Crainic<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a heuristic for scenario-based stochastic programs that decomposes the problem into a set of multi-scenario subproblems. To encourage consensus between solutions to the subproblems, solution information is shared across all subproblems and used to further restrict, using local branching strategies, the subproblems solved. We computationally study the effectiveness of the technique on instances of the stochastic network design problem.
