It iteratively constructs and solves a sequence of compact-sized linear, or convex, optimization problems. The problem size in each iteration is unaffected by the size of random samples, which makes it extremely efficient for large-scale problems. We prove that it converges to the true optimal solution. Applications include practical problems, such as, portfolio optimization.</br>
