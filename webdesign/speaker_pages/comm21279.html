Title: Itinerary-based Control with Nesting and Upsell<br>Author: Bill Pun, Senior Operations Research Consultant, Sabre Holdings, 3601 Grapevine Mills Pkwy, Grapevine, TX, 76951, United States of America, Bill.Pun@sabre.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that captures allocation nesting and   customer upsell at the itinerary level. Approximate dynamic programming is applied to   approximate the objective function by piecewise linear functions. The resulting allocation   policy is tested on a real airline network and benchmarked against the randomized linear   programming bid-price policy under various demand settings.
