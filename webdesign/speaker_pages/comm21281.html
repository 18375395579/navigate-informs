Title: Integrated, Multi-Category, Pricing, Assortment and Inventory Decisions under Cross Selling<br>Author: Bacel Maddah, Associate Professor, American University of Beirut, Bliss Street, Beirut, Lebanon, bm05@aub.edu.lb<br>Coauthor(s): Ahmed Ghoniem, Ameera Ibrahim<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We formulate a nonlinear integer program that jointly optimizes retail decisions on assortment, pricing, and inventory for two complementary categories, primary (e.g. toys) and secondary (e.g. batteries). We model  asymmetric cross-selling, where some customers who purchase from the primary category (e.g. a toy) also buy from the secondary category (e.g. a battery). We develop an exact linear reformulation, which is efficiently solved to optimality on CPLEX.
