Title: On Equivalent Reformulations for Absolute Value Equations and Related Problems<br>Author: Oleg Prokopyev, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, droleg@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sergiy Butenko, Andrew Trapp<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study absolute value equations (AVE) of the form Ax+B|x|=c. This problem is known to be NP-hard. We discuss relations of AVE with linear complementarity problem and mixed integer programming. Related problems in checking solvability of linear interval equations and inequalities are also considered.
