Title: Incorporating Equity Concerns into Vehicle Routing Problem for Bus Route Design<br>Author: Kelly Bertolaccini, University of Connecticut, 261 Glenbrook Rd, unit 3037, Storrs, Ct, 06269, United States of America, kelly.bertolaccini@engr.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Lownes<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This research develops a method for considering equity in vehicle routing for bus networks. Several objective functions reflecting different definitions of equity are used to formulate the VRP.  The VRP formulations are applied to several networks and solved using a genetic algorithm. The results of using the equity objective functions are compared to the results of a cost minimizing function on different sized networks to examine the cost of designing for different definitions of equity.
