Several objective functions reflecting different definitions of equity are used to formulate the VRP.  The VRP formulations are applied to several networks and solved using a genetic algorithm. The results of using the equity objective functions are compared to the results of a cost minimizing function on different sized networks to examine the cost of designing for different definitions of equity.</br>
