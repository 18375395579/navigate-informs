Ailon, Charikar, and Newman [4] and Ailon [2] proposed random-  ized constant factor approximation algorithms for these problems, which recursively generate a  solution by choosing a random vertex as pivot and dividing the remaining vertices into two  groups based on the pivot vertex. In this paper, we answer an open question in these works by giving deterministic approximation algorithms for these problems. The analysis of our algorithms is simpler than the analysis of the randomized algorithms in [4] and [2]. We evaluate the randomized algorithm of Ailon et al. [4] against our deterministic algorithm on two real world rank aggregation data sets. Based on the analysis of our deterministic algorithm, we also propose new algorithms that evaluate a small number of randomly chosen pivots and choose the best among these. We compare these algorithms against the CPLEX solver and other heuristics from the literature.</br>
