<br>Title: Forbidden vertices</br><br>Author: Gustavo Angulo, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, gangulo@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Ahmed, Santanu Dey, Volker Kaibel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We introduce and study the forbidden-vertices problem. Given a polytope P and a subset V of its vertices, we want to understand the complexity of linear optimization on the subset of vertices of P that are not contained in V. We show that the complexity of the problem changes significantly depending on the encoding of P and/or V. We provide additional tractability results and extended formulations when P has binary vertices only.</br>
