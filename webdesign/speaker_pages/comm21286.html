This leads to a sub-optimal solution. In this paper, we will build a DLP model together with RU and GB which will make capacities and demands non-independent but crossing room categories. Then we extend our DLP model to a stochastic model (SLP) to counter all uncertainties. Traditional SLP with dynamic programming (DP) is not solvable for most realistic networks because of the large dimensionality of the state space (e.g., typical numbers for even a modest-sized hotel with hundreds of thousands products and for each product DP will go along each of stages =  180-500,  each unit of capacities = 500-3000, each of time slots = 500 ?10000, leading to at least 10100 states).  Moreover, DP cannot directly deal with RU and GB. We will develop a stochastic model which is solvable together with RU and GB. We accomplish solving it in real time by suggesting a heuristic that generates a good initial feasible solution.</br>
