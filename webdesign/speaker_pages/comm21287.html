Mehdi Amini, Fred Glover, Gary Kochenberger</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new self-organizing algorithm for fixed-charge network flow problems based on ghost-image processes. Our algorithm iteratively modifies an idealized representation of the problem embodied in a self-organizing ghost image, enabling all steps to be performed with a primal network flow algorithm. Extensive computational testing on fixed-charge transportation problems is presented although our algorithm is not specialized to this class.</br>
