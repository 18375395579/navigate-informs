Title: Developing Distribution Plans Accounting for Warehousing Decisions<br>Author: Pratik Parikh, Assistant Professor, Wright State University, 3640 Col Glenn Hwy, Dayton, OH, 45435, United States of America, pratik.parikh@wright.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nan Kong, Bhanuteja Sainathuni, Xinhui Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose an approach to integrate warehousing decisions with inventory and transportation for supply chains. This problem is motivated by our observations at several supply chains that have experienced substantial operational inefficiencies due to a lack of such integration. Accounting for warehousing decisions can lead to both reductions in daily workload variance and total distribution cost. We also discuss a heuristic that can solve problem instances with over 100 stores and 1000 products.
