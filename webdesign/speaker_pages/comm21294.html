Title: Applied Optimization: Formulation and Algorithms for Engineering Systems<br>Author: Ross Baldick, Professor, The University of Texas, 1 University Station, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, ross@baldick.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The motivation for this book stems from my observations of the orientation of typical optimization texts used in optimization courses compared to the needs of students in our engineering program. Many optimization books and courses concentrate on the design of algorithms. In contrast, this book focuses on how to formulate simultaneous equations and optimization problems so that they can be solved by existing software.
