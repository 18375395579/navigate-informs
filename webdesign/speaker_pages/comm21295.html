Title: Dynamic Network Equilibrium Models<br>Author: Qipeng Phil Zheng, PhD student, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States of America, zqp@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Pardalos, Petros Xanthopoulos<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present some equilibrium models on a dynamic network. However, the equilibrium may not exist due to the capacity constraints of the network. Hence we come up with some bounded rational equilibrium models. These models might have a lot of applications, for example, highway tolling, and so on. All these models can be easily transformed to integer programming problem. Also we show some numerical examples.
