Optimica supports formulation of  dynamic optimization problems based on Modelica models. A prototype  compiler which supports a subset of Modelica and a first draft version  of Optimica is under development. The compiler also supports code  generation to AMPL, including automatic transcription of continuous  time derivatives. The resulting algebraic problem is solved by  AMPL/IPOPT.</br>
