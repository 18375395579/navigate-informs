<br>Title: Complexity of Bilevel Coherent Risk Programming</br><br>Author: Jonathan Eckstein, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, jeckstei@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We describe a bilevel programming approach to applying coherent risk measures to three-stage stochastic programming problems. This formulation technique avoids the time-inconsistency difficulties of naive models and the incomposability issues causing time-consistent formulations to have complicated, hard-to-explain objective functions. Unfortunately, we show that such bilevel formulations, when using the standard mean-semideviation and average-value-at-risk measures, are NP-hard.</br>
