It has been developed in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and has a window-based user interface. The tool visualizes project networks, project schedules, resource profiles and Gantt charts. Problem instances can either be read in from files or created manually using the GUI.   Project schedules can then be calculated using a variety of exact and heuristic solution procedures.
