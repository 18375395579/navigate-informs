Title: A Sequential Quadratic Optimization Algorithm with Rapid Infeasibility Detection<br>Author: Hao Wang, Lehigh University, Room 350, H.S. Mohler Laboratory, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, haw309@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Frank Curtis, James Burke<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a sequential quadratic optimization algorithm for nonlinear constrained optimization. The method attains strong global and fast local convergence properties for both feasible and infeasible instances, though we emphasize fast local convergence when solving infeasible problems. A two-phase strategy, carefully constructed parameter updates, and a line search are employed to promote such convergence. Numerical results are also presented.
