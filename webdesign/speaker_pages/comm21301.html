Title: Automated Conversion of Common Optimization Problem Structures to Mixed-integer Linear Programs<br>Author: Jared Erickson, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Room C210, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, JaredErickson2012@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Fourer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Optimization problems conveniently represented through the use of disjunctive linear constraints or polynomials in binary variables are commonly recast as MILPs for solution.  We present algorithms that detect these types of problems and transform them to MILPs automatically.  Our implementation uses the AMPL modeling language and works with various solvers.  The transformations allow for a wider variety of solvers to be used and can lead to reductions in solution time.
