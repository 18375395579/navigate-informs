However, in the situation of some natural disasters like hurricane Katrina, the whole city may become functionless. Therefore, customers can't rely on the facility located at the same place. We compare this problem with the p-median and p-center problems and analyze the problem on some simple networks. An efficient algorithm is provided for the problem on the general network.</br>
