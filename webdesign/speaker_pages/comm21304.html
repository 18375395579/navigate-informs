Title: On Convexification of Problems with Signomial Functions by Mixed Integer Programming<br>Author: Andriy Shapoval, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, ashapoval3@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eva Lee<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This work continues our previous research in convexification and underestimation techniques for structured mixed integer nonlinear programs with using conflict graphs and hypergraphs. The mixed hyperedge method, introduced for problems with posynomials before, is extended and applied now for problems with signomial terms. New facet-defining inequalities together with their separation are presented.
