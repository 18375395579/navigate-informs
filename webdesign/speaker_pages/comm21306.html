Title: Robust L1 Principal Component Analysis<br>Author: Paul Brooks, Assistant Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, PO Box 843083, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States of America, JPBrooks@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edward Boone<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) can be viewed as an optimization problem on a given training data set.  The objective is to find a linear subspace such that the sum of orthogonal distances of observations to the linear subspace is minimized.  In the interest of increasing robustness to outlier observations, we introduce a method for PCA where the L1 distance of points to the hyperplane is minimized, rather than the sum of squared Euclidean distances.
