<br>Title: Fabrication-Adaptive Optimization: Theory, Modeling, and Application to Photonic Crystal Design</br><br>Author: Han Abby Men, Postdoctoral associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Mass Ave, 31-211, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, abbymen@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Freund, Ngoc-Cuong Nguyen, Joel Saa-Seoane, Jaime Peraire</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Computed solutions of optimization problems often cannot be implemented directly (irrespective of data accuracy) due to technological limitations and/or deliberate simplification of a model for tractability. We present a modeling paradigm called fabrication-adaptive optimization that stems from the robust regularization of a function (Lewis). We develop computationally-focused theory and algorithms for the resulting non-convex problem, which we then apply to the design of photonic crystals.</br>
