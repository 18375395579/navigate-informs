We propose a multi-objective linear mix-integer programming model with the objectives of minimizing the total reverse logistics cost and maximizing consumer satisfaction. To solve this multi-objective problem, an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is developed. Its advantage over basic NSGA-II is validated by numerical examples.
