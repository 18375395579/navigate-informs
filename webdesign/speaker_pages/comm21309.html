Title: An Interior-Point $\ell_2$-Penalty Method for Large Scale Nonlinear Programming<br>Author: Lifeng Chen, Student, Columbia University, IEOR Department, New York, NY, 10027, United States, lc2161@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Donald Goldfarb<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present an interior-point l_2 penalty method for large scale nonlinear programming. A detailed description of the algorithm is provided, including computation of search directions, backtracking line search, second-order corrections and heuristics for motivating faster convergence. A comprehensive numerical study with several options of regularization and line search is presented. A comparison is provided with state-of-the-art interior-point codes for nonlinear programming.
