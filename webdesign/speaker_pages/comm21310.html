Title: MIP: Beyond Tradition<br>Author: Zonghao Gu, Distinguished Scientist, ILOG Inc., 4050 Walnut Creek Trail, Alpharetta, 30005, United States, gu@ilog.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Traditionally, MIP solvers use a branch-and-cut algorithm to search and return a single optimal solution. We present the progress of our recent MIP developments, including dynamic search and non-traditional parallel algorithm, with benchmarks showing the significant performance improvement, especially on hard models.
