Title: Counting Solutions of Constraint Integer Programs<br>Author: Stefan Heinz, ZIB, Division Scientific Computing Department Optimization, heinz@zib.de<br>Coauthor(s): Thorsten Koch, Tobias Achterberg<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk, we discuss how to extend branch-and-cut constraint integer programming frameworks to support the generation of all solutions. We  propose a method to detect so-called unrestricted subtrees, which  allows us to prune the constraint integer program search tree and to collect several solutions simultaneously. We present computational results of this branch-and-count paradigm which show the potential of the unrestricted subtree detection.
