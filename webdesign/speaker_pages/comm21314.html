<br>Title: Regularization for Constraint Reduction under Degeneracy</br><br>Author: Luke Winternitz, University of Maryland, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20770, United States of America, lukewinternitz@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andre Tits</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Constraint-reduced primal-dual interior-point algorithms for linear  programming consider only small working subsets of the (dual)  constraints in constructing search directions. Such algorithms can yield  dramatic speedup on some classes of LPs with large numbers of  inequality constraints.  In this talk, we discuss a type of  degeneracy that arises when applying constraint-reduced methods to  even well-posed problems and we investigate a regularization  designed to deal with the problem.</br>
