Title: Nested Preprocessing Monte Carlo Sample for the Multi-stage Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Lijian Chen, Visiting Professor, West Virginia University, MRB 353D, Morgantown, WV, 26506, United States of America, ljchen@mail.wvu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present an improvement to the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for the multi-stage stochastic programming. Our approach, named nested preprocessing, reduces the sample size without compromising the solution quality. We quantify each scenario by its unique geometric information to identify redundant scenarios. The nested preprocessing approach works on a pre-generated Monte-Carlo sample and this approach inherits all of SAA’s nice theoretical properties. Numerical results are presented.
