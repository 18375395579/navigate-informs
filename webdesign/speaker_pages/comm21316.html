Introducing stochasticity increases the complexity of already complex network design problems. Our experiences with KNITRO, FILTER—the solvers to deal with non-convex problems?show that these tools are not capable of handling larger problems. In this study we reduce the complexity of problem using sample average approximation (SAA) and decomposition approaches.</br>
