<br>Title: Two-echelon Location Heuristic (TELH) for LRP</br><br>Author: Abdulrahman Alenezi, Purdue University, 3230 Mendel Dr., west Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States, aalenezi@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leyla Ozsen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we present a general heuristic solution procedure for the Location Routing Problem (LRP). The LRP aims to determine the optimal depots locations, the assignment of customers to open depots, and the optimal sequence of visiting customers for each vehicle. The LRP is formulated as Two-echelon Location Problem (TELP) with route cost approximation. The performance of proposed heuristic is compared with other recent LRP heuristics.</br>
