Title: Sequential Clustering for Police Districting<br>Author: Christopher Rump, Associate Professor, Bowling Green State University, Applied Statistics & Operations Research, Bowling Green, OH, 43403, United States of America, cmrump@bgsu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of designing police command districts and, at a more granular level, police patrol beats.  In doing so, we consider a hierarchy of clustering objectives to measure the overall distance within each formed district.  The districting design optimization problem is modeled heuristically as a sequential clustering problem that for most choices of clustering objective can be solved efficiently via its linear programming relaxation.
