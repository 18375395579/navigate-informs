Title: Optimal Prima-dual Methods for a Class of Saddle-point Problems<br>Author: Guanghui Lan, Assistant Professor, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, glan@ise.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yuyuan Ouyang, Yunmei Chen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a novel accelerated primal-dual (APD) method for solving both deterministic and stochastic saddle point problems (SPP). We demonstrate that the APD method achieves the  same optimal rate of convergence as Nesterov's  smoothing technique for deterministic SPP. Moreover, the stochastic APD method appears to be first optimal algorithm for stochastic SPP.
