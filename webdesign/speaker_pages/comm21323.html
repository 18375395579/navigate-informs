Title: Stochastic First- and Zeroth-order Methods for Nonconvex Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Guanghui Lan, University of Florida, P.O.

We establish the rate of convergence of the method for computing an approximate stationary point of a nonlinear programming problem. This method is then specialized for solving a class of simulation-based  optimization problems in which only stochastic zeroth-order information is available.
