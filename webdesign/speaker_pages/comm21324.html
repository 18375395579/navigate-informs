Title: New Developments on the Maximum Quasi-clique Problem<br>Author: Zhuqi Miao, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Oklahoma State Un, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, zhuqi@ostatemail.okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Baski Balasundaram<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Quasi-clique is a useful model for cluster detection in real-life networks when the clique model is overly restrictive. This talk discusses the development of a new upper-bounding technique  for the maximum quasi-clique problem using Lagrangian duality and constraint generation to a quadratically constrained formulation of this problem. The results could be used to enhance existing exact algorithms.
