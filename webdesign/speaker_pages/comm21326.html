Title: Accounting for Risk Measure Ambiguity when Optimizing Financial Positions<br>Author: Jonathan Li, Assistant Professor, Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada, jonathan.li@telfer.uottawa.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Erick Delage<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: While many risk measures have been proposed in the past, it is still a great challenge today to select a risk measure that faithfully represents a decision maker's true risk attitude. In this work, we present new robust forms of measures that account precisely for the risk preference of a decision maker when comparing and optimizing financial positions.  Such measures can be evaluated and optimized through solving linear programs. Examples of portfolio optimization are provided.
