Title: Calibration of Stochastic Volatility Models: A Tikhonov Regularization Approach<br>Author: Min Dai, Associate Professor, National University of Singapore, Department of Mathematics, Singapore, Singapore, matdm@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Xingye Yue, Ling Tang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a Tikhonov regularization approach to calibrate stochastic volatility models. An efficient numerical algorithm is given. In contrast to existing literature, we do not assume that the stochastic volatility model has special structure, so our algorithm applies to calibration of general stochastic volatility models.
