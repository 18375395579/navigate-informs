Box 5800, MS 1326, Albuquerque, NM, 87113, United States of America, jwatson@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): David L. Woodruff, William E. Hart, John D. Siirola</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We describe new features in the open-source software package for modeling and optimization called Coopr. The Python-based algebraic modeling language Pyomo is being extended in many ways including the provision of user-defined workflows, more efficiency, and model blocks for specifying aggregations of model components. The PySP stochastic  programming package has expanded support for chance constraints and  automatic computation of the expected value of a stochastic solution.</br>
