It incorporates models of the  production infrastructure and the contractual framework. Customized  heuristics that exploit problem structure are required for global  solution of the resulting nonconvex MINLP in a branch-and-bound  framework. A strategy for efficient solutions of hierarchical  multiobjective instances is also discussed.</br>
