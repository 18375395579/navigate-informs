Title: Variational Inference for Large-scale Models of Discrete Choice<br>Author: Jon McAuliffe, University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School, jon@mcauliffe.com<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Braun<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We introduce variational methods for discrete-choice models, to conduct inference when datasets are too large for MCMC. Rather than using stochastic approximation, variational methods return a deterministic estimator of known functional form. The variational parameters approximate the posterior distribution more parsimoniously than MCMC, and are quicker to compute. The method avoids concerns like assessing MCMC convergence. We derive the algorithm, discuss some theory, and give results.
