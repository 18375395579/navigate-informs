Rather than using stochastic approximation, variational methods return a deterministic estimator of known functional form. The variational parameters approximate the posterior distribution more parsimoniously than MCMC, and are quicker to compute. The method avoids concerns like assessing MCMC convergence. We derive the algorithm, discuss some theory, and give results.</br>
