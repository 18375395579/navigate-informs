Title: Constructing a Maximum Utility Slate of  On-line Advertisements<br>Author: John Tomlin, Yahoo! Research, 2821 Mission College Blvd., Santa Clara, CA, 95054, United States, tomlin@yahoo-inc.com<br>Coauthor(s): S. Sathiya Keerthi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present an algorithm for constructing an optimal slate of sponsored search advertisements which respects the ordering that is the outcome of a generalized second price auction, but which must also accommodate complicating factors such as overall budget constraints. The algorithm is easily fast enough to use on the fly for typical problem sizes, or as a subroutine in an overall optimization.
