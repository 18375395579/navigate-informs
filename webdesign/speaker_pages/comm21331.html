Title: Integer Models for Tactical Planning in Forestry<br>Author: Evelyn Richards, Associate Professor, Faculty of Forestry and Environmental Management, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, E3B6C2, Canada, ewr@unb.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Eldon Gunn<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a system of integer programming models supplemented with local heuristics to solve tactical planning problems in a hierarchical forest management system.  The models provide decision support to managers for assessment of spatial tradeoffs.
