<br>Title: Uniformly-optimal Stochastic Dual Averaging Methods with Double Projections</br><br>Author: Xi Chen, PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, xichen@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Javier Peña, Qihang Lin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a stochastic dual averaging method for solving convex regularized optimization. Our approaches adopt two proximal operators for each iteration and the final solution is directly obtained from the proximal operator without an averaging step. With this technique, we achieve a uniformly-optimal convergence rate in expectation for both general convex and strongly convex objective function. The variance for the objective and high probability bounds have also been established.</br>
