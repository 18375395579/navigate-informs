Title: The Dial-a-flight Problem: Computing Bounds for an Expanded Multi-commodity Flow Formulation<br>Author: Faramroze Engineer, Georgia Institute of Technology, United States, fenginee@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): George Nemhauser, Martin Savelsbergh<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate a column generation re-formulation of the dial-a-flight problem in which the main challenge is solving the pricing problem. Due to the size of the networks representing possible jet itineraries and the side constraints that need to be satisfied, solving the pricing problem, a constrained shortest path problem, is intractable with standard labeling schemes. We use a multi-layered, dynamic labeling algorithm that exploits problem specific structure to solve the pricing problem.
