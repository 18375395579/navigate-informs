Title: Simple-set Cutting Planes for Mixed-integer Programming<br>Author: Ismael Regis de Farias JR., State University of New York, Dept. of Ind. and Syst. Eng., 403 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, defarias@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ming Zhao<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present extensions of mixed-integer rounding (MIR) and mixing-MIR inequalities to mixed-integer programming. In addition, we show how to apply our mechanism to generate inequalities in nonconvex nonlinear and  mixed-integer nonlinear programming.
