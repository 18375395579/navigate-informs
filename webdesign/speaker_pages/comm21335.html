Title: Duality and Exact Penalization via A Generalized Augmented Lagrangian Function<br>Author: Xiaoqi Yang, Professor, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Applied Mathematics, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, mayangxq@polyu.edu.hk<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk, we will discuss the existence of an optimal path and its convergence to the optimal set of a primal problem of minimizing an extended real-valued function via a generalized augmented Lagrangian and corresponding generalized augmented Lagrangian problems, in which no convexity is imposed on the augmenting function. We will show that these results further imply a zero duality gap property between the primal problem and the generalized augmented Lagrangian dual problem. A necessary and sufficient condition for the exact penalty representation in the framework of a generalized augmented Lagrangian is obtained. In the context of constrained programs, we will show that generalized augmented Lagrangians present a unified approach to several classes of exact penalization results.
