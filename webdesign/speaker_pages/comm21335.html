We will show that these results further imply a zero duality gap property between the primal problem and the generalized augmented Lagrangian dual problem. A necessary and sufficient condition for the exact penalty representation in the framework of a generalized augmented Lagrangian is obtained. In the context of constrained programs, we will show that generalized augmented Lagrangians present a unified approach to several classes of exact penalization results.</br>
