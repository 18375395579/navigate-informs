Title: An Alternative Modeling and Solution Approach for Planar Multi-Facility Location-Allocation Problem<br>Author: Alper Murat, Assistant Professor, Wayne State University, 4815 Fourth Street, Detroit, MI, 48202, United States, alper@eng.wayne.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vedat Verter<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a single-echelon, fixed-charge, planar facility location-allocation problem with large number of customers. We represent the customer demand with a continuous demand density function. After projecting location decisions into the allocation decision space and we demonstrate how this approach accommodates a wide-range of modeling features such as capacity constraint and non-linear cost functions. Lastly, we illustrate exact and heuristic solution methods for these extensions.
