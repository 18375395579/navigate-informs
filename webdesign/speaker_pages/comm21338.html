Besides being used to generate lower bounds, the subproblem solutions are exploited within Lagrangean heuristics. Valid cuts are added to the subproblem. The procedure is applied to a benchmark set of fifteen problems from the literature. The Lagrangean lower bound and the heuristics are on average 8.2% and   0.043% from the optimum, respectively.</br>
