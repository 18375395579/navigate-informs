<br>Title: Optimal Instance Selection for Improved Decision Trees</br><br>Author: Shuning Wu, Iowa State University, Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50010, United States, wushuning@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we present a new optimization-based approach for instance selection that uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to select a subset of instances that result in a simple but yet accurate decision trees. The research shows that GA-based instance selection works best for low entropy datasets and it is able to increase the average instances associated with the leaves of the decision trees, thus instance selection can be used as an effective alternative to prune decision trees.</br>
