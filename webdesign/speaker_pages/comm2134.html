Title: Multi-ship Crane Sequencing with Yard Congestion Constraints<br>Author: Diego Klabjan, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 North Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, klabjan@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi, Shawn Choo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Crane sequencing in container terminals determines the order of ship discharging and loading jobs that quay cranes perform. The yard congestion constraints are relaxed in the spirit of the Lagrangian relaxation so that the problem decomposes by vessel into smaller sub-problems solved by branch-and-price. An efficient primal heuristic is designed. Computational experiments reveal that we are able to solve very large problems in a reasonable computational time.
