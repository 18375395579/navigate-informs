Title: Optimal Mechanism Design for Multi-item Auctions: A Robust Optimization Approach<br>Author: Chaithanya Bandi, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, cbandi@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a robust optimization approach to the problem of auction design for multi-item auctions with budget  constrained buyers. We model the unknown valuations using uncertainty sets, constructed using historical information and limit laws of probability theory. In this setting, we characterize the optimal auction extending the work of Myerson to auctions with budgets and correlated valuations. This approach is numerically tractable and is robust to distribution misspecifications.
