Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, jis6@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Linderoth</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We describe a solver capable of tackling large-scale multistage stochastic linear programs (MSLP).  The solver is based on a nested-decomposition (ND) algorithm, and we study how to combine the algorithm with the power of grid computing.  Computational results addressing the challenges of effectively implementing ND on a grid are given.  Using our solver, we also study the value obtained in solving MSLP as opposed to alternative methods for dealing with uncertainty.</br>
