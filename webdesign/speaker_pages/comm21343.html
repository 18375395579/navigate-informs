<br>Title: Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion Problems</br><br>Author: Haw-ren Fang, Postdoctoral Associate, Univ. of Minnesota, Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Minneapolis, MN, 55108, United States, hrfang@cs.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dianne O'Leary</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) is one in which the (i,j) entry is specified by the distance between particles i and j. The Euclidean distance matrix completion problem (EDMCP) is to complete a given partial matrix to make it an EDM.    We survey 3 different approaches to tackling EDMCP, and advocate solving it by nonconvex optimization. To avoid local minima, we develop an initialization and a dimensionality relaxation scheme, involving a weighted version of principal component analysis.</br>
