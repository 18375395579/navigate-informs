Title: A Mean-risk Stochastic Programming Model for Retrofitting Transportation Network<br>Author: Jie Lu, Clemson University, 102 Calhoun St, Apt 130, Clemson, SC, 29631, United States of America, jlu3@clemson.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We formulate a mean-risk two-stage stochastic programming model for allocating the retrofitting resources for a transportation network to reduce social losses. Due to the numerical challenges, a decomposition based progressive hedging method is considered to improve the solution efficiency, especially when handling large-scale problems. In this talk, we will present preliminary results of a numerical example based on Sioux-Falls network.
