Title: First-order Algorithm with O(log 1/epsilon) Convergence for Epsilon-equilibrium in Zero-sum Games<br>Author: Andrew Gilpin, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, gilpin@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tuomas Sandholm, Javier Pena<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose an iterated version of Nesterov's first-order smoothing  method for the two-person zero-sum game equilibrium problem. Our  algorithmic scheme computes an epsilon-equilibrium in O(kappa(A) log  1/epsilon) first-order iterations, where kappa(A) is a certain  condition measure of the game's payoff matrix A. This improves upon the previous first-order methods which required O(1/epsilon) iterations, and it matches interior-point methods in terms of the algorithm's dependence  on epsilon.
