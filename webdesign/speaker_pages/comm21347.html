<br>Title: QPCCs, QCQPs, and copositive programming</br><br>Author: John Mitchell, Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Math Sciences, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, mitchj@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jong-Shi Pang, Lijie Bai</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We show that members of a certain class of quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) can be represented as quadratic programs with complementarity constraints (QPCCs). We exploit this relationship to show that the Frank-Wolfe theorem holds for the members of this class of QCQPs, namely that they attain their optimal value if it exists. We also show that a completely positive relaxation of certain QPCCs is tight, even if the complementary variables in the QPCC are unbounded.</br>
