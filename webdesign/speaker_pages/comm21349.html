The former yields a smaller problem while the later a tighter one. The tightness of (HR) can be further improved by using basic steps. In this work we propose a cutting plane algorithm for convex GDP that exploits the advantages of (BM), (HR) and basic steps. We solve the continuous relaxation of the (BM), and use the strong formulation of (HR) after basic steps to derive cutting planes</br>
