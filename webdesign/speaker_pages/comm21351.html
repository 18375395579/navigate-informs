<br>Title: A Discrete-time Approach for Modeling Two-factor Mean-reverting Stochastic Processes</br><br>Author: James Dyer, Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, CBA 5.202, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, Jim.Dyer@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Warren Hahn</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We generalize the recombining binomial lattice approach for valuing real options to address underlying stochastic processes that are mean-reverting. We implement this approach in two-dimensional binomial lattice format, apply it to two hypothetical real option problems, and compare the results to those from simulation- and dynamic programming-based methods.</br>
