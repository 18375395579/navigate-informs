<br>Title: A Pattern-Driven Optimization Approach for Appointment Scheduling</br><br>Author: Michele Samorani, University of Alberta, School of Business, Edmonton, Canada, samorani@ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bora Kolfal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a clinic with stochastic service times, undifferentiated providers, heterogeneous patients, and 30% no-show rate. Due to the many stochastic inputs to consider, it is hard to solve the problem analytically. So, to find general solutions to the problem, we employ a pattern-driven optimization approach: first, we use simulation to find good schedules for different problem instances; then, we analyze these schedules through data mining to find patterns that are desirable in any schedule</br>
