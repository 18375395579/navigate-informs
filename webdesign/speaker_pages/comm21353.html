Title: New Approaches to Mixed Integer Programming Heuristics<br>Author: Philipp Christophel, Operations Research Specialist, SAS Institute Inc., 100 SAS Campus Dr, Cary, NC, 27513, United States of America, philipp.christophel@sas.com<br>Coauthor(s): Menal Güzelsoy, Imre Pólik<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Mixed integer programming (MIP) solver software heavily relies on a potentially large number of primal heuristics to identify or improve primal solutions to the problem at hand. In this talk we discuss priviously unexplored structural properties of MIP problems and how to exploit them to get better primal heuristics.
