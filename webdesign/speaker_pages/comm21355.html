Title: Causal Inference for Time-series Analysis: Simultaneous Denoising and Feature Selection<br>Author: Mohammad H. Poursaeidi, University of Houston, E 209 Engineering Building, Houston, TX, United States of America, mhpoursaeidi@uh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erhun Kundakcioglu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a new hyperplane based approach that performs regression and feature selection while simultaneously removing noise from time-series data.  Mixed integer nonlinear programming formulations are developed for linear regression. These formulations are also extended via kernel trick to perform nonlinear regression. The problem is proven to be NP-hard and a heuristic algorithm is developed for large data sets.
