In addition, this portfolio has a return distribution close to a user-specified, target distribution. Thus, this return distribution can be shaped and “crafted?to a desirable form, to the extent that is achievable. The model is formulated as a multi-objective conditional-value-at-risk minimization problem and represented as a LP of large size. Further on, a cutting plane representation of CVaR is used. This approach dramatically increases the execution speed and makes the model solvable even for very large number of scenarios. The performance of the model on real data drawn from the FTSE 100 index is investigated.
