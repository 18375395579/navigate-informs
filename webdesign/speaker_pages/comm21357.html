<br>Title: The Most Likely Path Problem (MLPP)</br><br>Author: Daniel Reich, PhD Candidate in Applied Mathematics, University of Arizona, 617 North Santa Rita Avenue, PO Box 210089, Tucson, AZ, 85721?089, United States of America, dreich@math.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leonardo B. Lopes</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a stochastic shortest path problem that we refer to as the MLPP, and explain why solving this problem is intractable on general networks. We introduce a dynamic programming algorithm for identifying the Most Likely Path (MLP) on series-parallel networks, and use subpath optimality and sequential sampling in doing so. On this network class, we introduce analytical lower and upper bounds for the probability of the MLP, and explain how and why these bounds can be computed efficiently.</br>
