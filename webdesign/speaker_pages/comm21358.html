Title: Solving Stochastic Combinatorial Truckload Procurement Auctions in Parallel<br>Author: Shervin AhmadBeygi, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, Shervin@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Damian Beil, Amitabh Sinha, Richard Chen, Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a stochastic multi-commodity-flow formulation to solve the winner determination problem for combinatorial procurement auctions in which the carrier costs are uncertain. We exploit the problem structure in order to develop a solution approach based on Benders Decomposition which can be implemented within a parallel processing framework to improve the algorithm tractability.
