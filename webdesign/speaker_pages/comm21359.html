Title: Balancing Perfectly Periodic Service Schedules Quickly with Aggregation<br>Author: Jeffrey Herrmann, Associate Professor, University of Maryland-College Park, ent of Mechanical Engineering, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, jwh2@isr.umd.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Scheduling periodic services that have different period lengths seeks a schedule in which the workload is nearly the same in every time unit.  This talk will discuss a new aggregation approach that separates the problem into subproblems for each period length, forms aggregate services, schedules these, and then creates a solution to the original instance.  Computational experiments show that using aggregation generates high-quality solutions and reduces computational effort.
