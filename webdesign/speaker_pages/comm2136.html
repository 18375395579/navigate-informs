Title: The Ritter Decomposition Algorithm Applied to the Bus Evacuation Problem<br>Author: Victor Pereira, PhD Candidate, Virginia Tech, 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, vpereira@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Douglas Bish<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This presentation introduces a variation of the Bus Evacuation Problem where evacuees arrive at the pick-up locations at a constant rate, from the onset of the evacuation to a location-specific evacuation deadline. In addition, a solution approach relying on a variation of the Ritter Decomposition Algorithm to solve bordered-structure problems with quadratic objective functions and 0-1 mixed integer subproblems is proposed. Empirical results are discussed.
