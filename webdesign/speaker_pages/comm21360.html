Title: An RLT-based Branch-and-Reduce Approach to the Regional Water Supply System Design Problem<br>Author: Fujun Lan, University of Arizona, 1127 E. James E. Rogers Way, Room 111, P.O. Box 210020, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, flan@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guzin Bayraksan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a multistage model to design a regional water supply system and develop an algorithm to solve the resulting nonconvex problem. The lower bounding problem is constructed by successively transforming the space of certain design variables, polyhedral outer approximations, and Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT). Feasibility and optimality-based range reduction techniques are employed to speed up convergence. We discuss convergence and present computational results.
