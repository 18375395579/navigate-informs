<br>Title: Greedy Randomized Algorithm for Large-scale Set Covering Problem for Sibling Reconstruction</br><br>Author: Chun-An Chou, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Rd., Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, joechou@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Art Chaovaitwongse, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Bhaskar DasGupta, Mary Ashley, Saad Sheikh, Isabel Caballero</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a complex set covering model for reconstructing sibling relationships from genetic markers. We propose a greedy randomized algorithm to generate probable sibling sets, similar to column generation framework. The algorithm uses a greedy function to maximize the group coverage and randomly prioritize individuals to be included in a sibset. The results of this study may lead to a greater understanding of fundamental biological processes like mating systems and adaptive trait evolution.</br>
