<br>Title: New Cuts for 0-1 Programming Problems</br><br>Author: Osman Oguz, Assoc. Prof., Bilkent University, Ankara, -, 06800, Turkey, ooguz@bilkent.edu.tr</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Cuts separating noninteger extreme point solutions from the solution set of the LP relaxation of a 0-1 programming problem are introduced.  These cuts are similar to cover cuts in function, however the logic behind their derivation is different. Some experimental results on the use of the cuts will also be reported.</br>
