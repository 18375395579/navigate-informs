<br>Title: A Study of Various Model Formulations and Settings for a Real-world Large-scale Acquisition Problem</br><br>Author: Frank Muldoon, Sandia National Laboratories, 1515 Eubank, Albuquerque, NM, United States of America, fmmuldo@sandia.gov</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Given the need to model and solve large defense acquisition problems quickly and efficiently, it is important to create specific formulations with particular settings that achieve these goals. We investigate the effects of various model formulations and optimization parameter settings for one such Army acquisition problem. We describe various cases in which different formulations and settings decreased solution times and integrality gaps in addition to instances that had the opposite effect.</br>
