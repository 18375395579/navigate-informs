We ask whether operational constraints such as plant ramp-rates, zonal reserve requirements, and start-up decisions would significantly affect investments chosen by a two-stage stochastic transmission optimal expansion model. The value of integrating these features (in terms of improved expected performance) is also estimated.</br>
