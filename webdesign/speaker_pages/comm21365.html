Our results generalize the work of Krarup and Bilde, Eppen and Martin, and others, to the stochastic case. They also extend the work of the current authors and others on extended formulations for mixing sets. To the best of our knowledge, they provide the only known convex hull descriptions of stochastic lot-sizing problems having more than two periods.
