Title: Optimal Allocation of Surgeries to Days and ORs<br>Author: Serhat Gul, PhD Student, Arizona State University, Dept of Industrial Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, serhat.gul@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton, John Fowler<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The assignment of surgeries to operating rooms (ORs) and days is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this talk, we present a two-stage stochastic programming model for the assignment of surgeries to days and ORs. The objective includes a fixed cost of opening ORs, surgical staff overtime cost, and tardiness cost relative to the due date of a surgery. We solve the program with binary decisions in the first stage and simple recourse in the second stage using the L-shaped method.
