The model optimizes multiple objectives while giving priorities to renewable generation technologies and having several geographical location alternatives for the generation units. The approach to solve this problem is based on multiobjective linear programming and analytical hierarchy process. A case study from the Mexican Electric Power System is used to illustrate the proposed framework.
