Title: Dynamic Programming for the Crossbar Switch<br>Author: Ciamac Moallemi, Graduate Student, Stanford University, Department of Electrical Engineering, Packard 274, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, ciamac@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sunil Kumar, Benjamin Van Roy<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: There are a number of heuristics based on generalized maximum-weight matching for scheduling in the crossbar switch.  We interpret them in terms of dynamic programming; in particular, each heuristic can be viewed as a greedy policy with respect to an approximation of the value function. We apply an approximate dynamic programming algorithm to generate alternative approximations. We compare behavior and performance of resulting scheduling policies to those of the heuristics.
