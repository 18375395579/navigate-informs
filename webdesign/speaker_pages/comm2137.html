<br>Title: Designing Experiments for Robust Optimization Problems: The Vs-optimality Criterion</br><br>Author: Irad Ben-Gal, Dept. of Industrial Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, 69978, Israel, bengal@eng.tau.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hilla Ginsburg</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We suggest an experimentation strategy for robust design of empirically fitted models. A new design of experiment optimality criterion, termed Vs-optimal, prioritizes the estimation of the model's coefficients, such that the variance of the optimal solution is minimized. We present an analytical formulation for linear models and a numerical procedure for higher-order models.  In a case study, the proposed approach results in a better robust solution in comparison to standard methods.</br>
