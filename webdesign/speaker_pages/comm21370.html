Title: Incremental Network Design with Maximum Flow<br>Author: Dmytro Matsypura, Lecturer, University of Sydney, Rm 478, Merewether Building, Sydney, Australia, dmytro.matsypura@sydney.edu.au<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Savelsbergh, Thomas Kalinowski<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Network infrastructure upgrades are a common phenomenon and typically occur over time due to various constraints. We consider a class of incremental network design problems and focus on one of its variants:   incremental network design with maximum flow. We present an integer program formulation, investigate structural properties of optimal solutions and analyze worst-case performance of various heuristics.
