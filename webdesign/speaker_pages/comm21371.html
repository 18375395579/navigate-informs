The proposed solution algorithm first preprocesses the original road network and stores the routes connecting the stations as the edges of the new network. Then, algorithm generates a new feasible network. Lastly, on this feasible network, for any given origin-destination pairs, the well known Floyd’s algorithm is applied to find shortest feasible paths.
