Title: On the Solution of Stochastic Nash-cournot Problems in Electricty Markets<br>Author: Ankur Kulkarni, Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engg, UIUC, Urbana, IL, United States, akulkar3@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Uncertainty in demand, fuel prices and generation availability imply that agents are faced by  stochastic multi-period optimization problems. Using complementarity theory, we show existence of Nash equilibria under a variety of market assumptions. Through the use of matrix-splitting ideas, a scalable convergent algorithm for solving such  problems is provided. Finally, we provide some numerical results to show utililty of such an approach.
