The allocation problem is solved iteratively using agents with embedded heuristic and stochastic strategies to gerenate objectives for the scheduling subproblems. We implement the approach in a distributed computing environment and show multi-product literature example that has  been expanded to cover multiple plants with different internal cost structures.</br>
