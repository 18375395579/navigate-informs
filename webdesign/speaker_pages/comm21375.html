Title: Distributed Modeling of Long-Term Production Scheduling in Multisite, Multiproduct Enterprise System<br>Author: Steinar Hauan, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Chemical Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, steinhau@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Israel B Owusu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: An agent based optimization approach is applied to enterprise optimization problems consisting of demand allocation and scheduling. The allocation problem is solved iteratively using agents with embedded heuristic and stochastic strategies to gerenate objectives for the scheduling subproblems. We implement the approach in a distributed computing environment and show multi-product literature example that has  been expanded to cover multiple plants with different internal cost structures.
