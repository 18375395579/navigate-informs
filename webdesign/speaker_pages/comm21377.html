<br>Title: Mathematical Programming for Regression Subset Selection</br><br>Author: Young Woong Park, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, ywpark@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diego Klabjan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Subset selection in multiple linear regressions is to choose a subset of candidate explanatory variables that tradeoff error and the number of variables selected. We built mathematical programs for subset selection and compare the performance of an LP-based branch-and-bound algorithm with valid inequalities to known heuristics. Our model is also applicable to the case with more candidate explanatory variables than observations where we present a heuristic based on the model.</br>
