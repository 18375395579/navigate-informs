Title: Convex Hulls of Low-dimensional Quadratic Forms over Polytopes<br>Author: Sam Burer, The University of Iowa, samuel-burer@uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: When optimizing a nonconvex quadratic function over a polytope, approximating the convex hull of variable products is a fundamental issue. In this talk, we show how to exactly represent such convex hulls over simplices (in dimension 4 or less) and over boxes (in dimension 3 or less) using linear and semidefinite programming.
