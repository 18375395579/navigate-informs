Title: A Branch-and-bound Approach for Maximum Quasi-cliques<br>Author: Zhuqi Miao, PhD Student, Oklahoma State University, 808 N.

Quasi-clique detection has been accomplished using heuristic approaches in various applications of graph-based data mining. However, exact approaches for the problem are limited to two mixed integer programming formulations that were proposed recently. This article presents a new combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for the maximum quasi-clique problem and studies its performance on benchmark instances.
