Keha, Assistant Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering, Arizona State University, PO Box 875906, Tempe, AZ, 85287-5906, United States, ahmet.keha@asu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we introduce an integer programming formulation for the problem of finding the minimum distance of a linear code. We study the polyhedral structure of the single constraint relaxation of this integer programming formulation. We next show how we can use the strong inequalities found as our cuts in a branch and cut algorithm. We finally present some computational experiments that shows the effectiveness of our cuts.</br>
