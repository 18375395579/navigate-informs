Users with bounded rationality seek for acceptable paths rather than a necessarily minimum one. BRUE flow distribution is generally non-unique and can be characterized as a non-convex set by relaxing the Wardrop's First Principle. A robust pricing scheme is determined by solving a nonlinear mathematical program with complementarity constraints to minimize the worst-case travel time.</br>
