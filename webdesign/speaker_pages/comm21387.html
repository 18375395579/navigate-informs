Snyder, Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop tools for analysis for a retailer subject to supply disruptions. We combine discrete-event uncertainty (disruptions) and continuous sources of uncertainty (stochastic demand or supply yield), which have differing impacts on optimal inventory settings and make closed-form optimal solutions unachievable. We develop a closed-form approximate solution by focusing on a single stochastic period of demand or yield and demonstrate that it performs very well compared to the optimal solution.</br>
