Title: Inventory Systems with Stochastic Demand and Supply: Properties and Approximations<br>Author: Amanda Schmitt, Postdoctoral Associate, MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics, 77 Massachusetts Ave., E40-266, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, aschmitt@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence V. Snyder, Max Shen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop tools for analysis for a retailer subject to supply disruptions. We combine discrete-event uncertainty (disruptions) and continuous sources of uncertainty (stochastic demand or supply yield), which have differing impacts on optimal inventory settings and make closed-form optimal solutions unachievable. We develop a closed-form approximate solution by focusing on a single stochastic period of demand or yield and demonstrate that it performs very well compared to the optimal solution.
