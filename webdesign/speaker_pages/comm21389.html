Title: A Constraint Generation Solution Method for Robust Breast Cancer IMRT Treatment Planning<br>Author: Houra Mahmoudzadeh, University of Toronto, 5 Kings College Rd, Toronto, Canada, houra@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Chan, Thomas Purdie<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a constraint generation solution method to efficiently solve a previously developed robust optimization problem for breast cancer radiation therapy.  We incorporate geometrical information of the patient’s anatomy in the optimization to speed up the solution process. We compare the computational complexity of this method with that of directly solving the robust counterpart. Clinical data is used to test our model, which is compared with conventional treatment planning methods.
