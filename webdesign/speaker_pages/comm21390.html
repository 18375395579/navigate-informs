<br>Title: Scheduling with Multitasking</br><br>Author: Nicholas Hall, Professor, Ohio State University, 2100 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, United States of America, hall.33@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Leung, Chung-Lun Li</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers scheduling under multitasking, i.e. the processing of a selected job is interrupted by other jobs. Multitasking occurs in administration, project management, and manufacturing. Most classical solution methods no longer apply under multitasking. We develop optimal algorithms for several classical single machine problems under multitasking. For one intractable problem, we describe and test a heuristic. For four problems, we study the cost increase due to multitasking.</br>
