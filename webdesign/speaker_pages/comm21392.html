<br>Title: A Global Optimization Framework for Mixed-Integer Signomial Programs</br><br>Author: Christodoulos Floudas, Stephen C. Macaleer '63 Professor in Engineering and Applied Science, Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Princeton University, Department of Chemical & Biological Eng., Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, floudas@princeton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ruth Misener</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Expanding the Global Mixed-Integer Quadratic Optimizer, GloMIQO, we  develop a framework for addressing mixed-integer signomial optimization problems to epsilon-global optimality.  Our approach reformulates user input, detects special mathematical structure, and globally optimizes the transformed problem.  This presentation highlights dynamically generated cutting planes based on convexification strategies including alphaBB, RLT, and specialized underestimators for specific functional forms.</br>
