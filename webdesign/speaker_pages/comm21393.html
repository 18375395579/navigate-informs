As mathematical problems, they show a surprising connection to random graphs, to mathematical programming, and to linear algebra.  As computer science problems, they are an example of a problem area that is theoretically hard, but almost always easy in practice.  We show a few recent results from this domain, paricularly oriented toward practical examples that incorporate recombination.</br>
