<br>Title: Cluster Based Optimization for Multi-level Transit Hub Locations</br><br>Author: Jie Yu, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Maryland, Department of Civil Engineering, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, yujie@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yue Liu, Gang-Len Chang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This study proposes a cluster based optimal location model for urban multi-level transit hubs. To solve the proposed mixed integer model in a cost-effective way, a new integer non-linear programming reformulation was designed to efficiently reduce the number of variables and the bilinear constraints in the INLP were then re-modeled by linear functions to make the problem easily handled by existing MIP solvers. The model was successfully applied in Suzhou Industrial Park, China.</br>
