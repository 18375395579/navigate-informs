<br>Title: On the Equivalence of Robust Optimization and Regularization in Statistics</br><br>Author: Apostolos Fertis, MIT, 77 Mass. Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, afertis@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Regularization has been proposed as an effective idea in Statistics. Robust optimization has been proposed as an effective idea to immunize solutions against data uncertainty. We prove that the application of the robust optimization paradigm leads to regularized and sparse solutions in regression and classification. We demonstrate in experiments on both artificial and real data that the robust optimization solutions have improved out-of-sample performance.</br>
