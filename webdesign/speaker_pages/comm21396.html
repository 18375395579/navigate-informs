Title: Branch-and-price Algorithm for Maximum Weighted Clique Problem in Biomarker Identification<br>Author: Seyed Javad Sajjadi, University of South Florida, 4202 Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL, United States of America, ssajjadi@mail.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng, Xiaoning Qian, Amin Ahmadi Adl<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: To decrease the dimensionality of a data set in the feature selection algorithm, we identify a subset of most discriminating biomarkers by solving a multiple maximum weighed clique problem to optimality. We implement the branch and price technique to obtain the exact solution.
