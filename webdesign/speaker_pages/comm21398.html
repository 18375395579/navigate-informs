<br>Title: Optimization and Dynamical Systems Algorithms for Finding Equilibria of Stochastic Games</br><br>Author: Arun Sen, Senior Consultant, NERA Economic Consulting, 1166 Ave. of the Americas, 28th floor, New York, NY, 10036, United States of America, sen@post.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dave Shanno</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present two new algorithms for computing Nash equilibria of stochastic games. One is a global random start algorithm  based on nonlinear programming, while the other combines  a dynamical system with nonlinear programming to find stable  equilibria. Promising numerical results are presented.</br>
