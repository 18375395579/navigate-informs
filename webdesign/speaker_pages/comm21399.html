Title: Continualized Approximation Method for Binary Integer Programming<br>Author: Kathrine von Haartman, Ph.D Student and Systems Analyst, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering, Box 352650, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, meggie.vonhaartman@clearsightsystems.com<br>Coauthor(s): Wolf Kohn, Zelda Zabinsky<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper uses continualization techniques to find approximate solutions to binary integer programming problems. The algorithm emphasizes the construction of sequential approximations to a solution using a meta-control approach that has low polynomic time complexity. This algorithm will be illustrated with an example.
