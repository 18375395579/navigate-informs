The problem is formulated as a pure integer program and solved with Xpress-MP. The model includes both full-time and part-time workers, as well as the constraints about work procedure, limit on the number of staff, etc. The results indicate that the model reflects practical work under same condition and creates cost effective staff schedule under modified condition.
