We first focus on first-come first-serve (FCFS) allocation of components to products. Using a novel stochastic programming formulation, we compute solutions that are within one percent of the lower bound for realistically sized systems. We then answer the following questions: How do common heuristics used in practice compare to our performance, and how costly is the FCFS assumption?</br>
