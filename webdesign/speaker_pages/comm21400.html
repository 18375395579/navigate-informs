Title: Mixing Inequalities and Maximal Lattice-Free Triangles<br>Author: Santanu Dey, Center for Operations Research and Ecnomometrics, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium, Santanu.Dey@uclouvain.be<br>Coauthor(s): Laurence Wolsey<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk, we discuss a method for using mixing inequalities to obtain cutting planes from general simplex tableau. We present a relationship between mixing inequalities and maximal lattice-free triangles and propose a method for strengthening these inequalities based on lifting of nonbasic integer variables.
