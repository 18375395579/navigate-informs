Title: A Gradual Non-convexation Penalty Method for Minimizing VAR<br>Author: Thomas Coleman, Professor and Ophelia Lazaridis University Research Chair, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, Canada, tfcoleman@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Yuying Li<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Computing an optimal portfolio with minimum value-at-risk (VaR) is computationally challenging since there are many local minimizers. We consider a nonlinearly constrained optimization formulation directly based on VaR definition in which VaR is defined by a probabilistic inequality constraint. Computational comparisons will be presented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method
