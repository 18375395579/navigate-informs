Title: System Optimal Assignment Under User Specific Time Constraints<br>Author: Deepak Kumar, PhD Candidate, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1761, ECJ Hall 6.202, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, dkumar@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper we study the system optimal assignment problem where a fraction of the demand has specific travel time constraint. We analyze the feasibility of the problem and discuss the properties of the problem. As the problem is NP-complete we also propose a simple heuristic to obtain the bounds on the solution.
