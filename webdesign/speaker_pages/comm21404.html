Title: Postoptimality Analysis for Integer Programming using Binary Decision Diagrams<br>Author: John Hooker, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, john@hooker.tepper.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tarik Hadzic<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We show how binary decision diagrams (BDDs) can be used to solve and obtain postoptimality analysis for linear and nonlinear integer programming problems. The constraint set corresponds to a unique reduced BDD that represents all feasible or near-optimal solutions, and in which optimal solutions correspond to certain shortest paths. The BDD can be queried in real time for in-depth postoptimality reasoning. We illustrate the analysis on capital budgeting and network reliability problems.
