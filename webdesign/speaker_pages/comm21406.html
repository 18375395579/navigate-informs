This set has both complementarity constraints and binary variables. We describe a procedure to derive the convex hull of this set when a single complementarity constraint is present. We then use this result to obtain a closed-form description of the convex hull of special cases, including one with two complementarity constraints. We conclude with computational results.</br>
