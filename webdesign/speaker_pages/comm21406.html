Title: Polyhedral Results for Network Interdiction Problem<br>Author: Danial Davarnia, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, d.davarnia@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard, Mohit Tawarmalani<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a relaxation of the KKT system that occurs when reformulating network interdiction problems as mathematical programs. This set has both complementarity constraints and binary variables. We describe a procedure to derive the convex hull of this set when a single complementarity constraint is present. We then use this result to obtain a closed-form description of the convex hull of special cases, including one with two complementarity constraints. We conclude with computational results.
