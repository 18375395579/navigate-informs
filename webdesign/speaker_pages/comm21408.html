<br>Title: A Graph-based Formulation for the Shift Rostering Problem</br><br>Author: David S.W. Lai, Ph.D. student, Systems Engineering & Eng. Mgt.

A graph-based formulation is proposed where the feasible shift patterns are represented by the paths of a graph. The formulation size depends on the structure of the work-rule constraints and is independent of the number of staff. This is particularly beneficial when the work rules possess sufficient structure that results in a small formulation.</br>
