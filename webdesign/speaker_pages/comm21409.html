This research considers vehicle purchase, relocation, and rental decisions to minimize total distribution costs and fleet investment costs over multiple time periods and multiple depots. A two-phase approach is proposed to solve the real-life problem efficiently. Numerical studies, conducted using an industrial dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the two-phase approach.</br>
