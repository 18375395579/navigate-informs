<br>Title: The CP(Graph) Computation Domain in Constraint Programming</br><br>Author: Gr√©goire Dooms, Universit?Catholique de Louvain, INGI, place St Barbe, 2, Louvain-la-Neuve, 1348, Belgium, dooms@info.ucl.ac.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yves Deville, Pierre Dupont</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: CP(Graph) introduces graph variables which domain is abstracted as a graph interval and constraints over these variables. It is integrated with the finite domain and finite sets domain, allowing the reuse of constraints of these domains. Graph intervals ease the formulation and implementation of filtering algorithms for global graph constraints. We present novel graph constraints and a proof of concept available as contributed open-source code in the Gecode constraint programming library.</br>
