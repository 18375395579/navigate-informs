The approach solves the problem over a reduced feasible region that hopefully contains the optimal solution. We compare several ways to generate the reduced feasible region and give an approach to improve the reduced feasible region. We also give extensive computational results that show that our heuristic gives solutions that are very close to the optimal ones.</br>
