Network problems are prevalent in every area of technology. Currently, solution approaches for network performance optimization are restricted to traditional operations research approaches or highly involved heuristics. The algorithms are expected to have a broad range of applicability such as: Financial, Manufacturing and Network Reliability.</br>
