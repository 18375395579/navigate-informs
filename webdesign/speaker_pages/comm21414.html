Title: Smoothing and Parametric Rules for Stochastic Mean-CVaR Optimal Execution Strategy<br>Author: Somayeh Moazeni, Research Associate, Princeton University, Sherrerd Hall, Charlton Street, Princeton, NJ, 08536, United States of America, somayeh@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yuying Li, Thomas Coleman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Computing optimal stochastic portfolio execution strategies under an appropriate risk consideration presents many computational challenges. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo simulations,   a smoothing technique, and a parametric representation of a stochastic strategy to minimize mean and Conditional Value-at-Risk of the execution cost. We further handle constraints using a smoothed exact penalty function. The proposed approach can be generalized to other risk measures.
