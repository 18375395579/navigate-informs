<br>Title: The Mixing-MIR Set with Two Nondivisible Capacities</br><br>Author: Ismael de Farias, Associate Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering, Texas Tech, Lubbock, TX, United States of America, defarias@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ming Zhao</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The capacitated mixing-MIR set, CMMIR, is a generalization of Nemhauser and Wolse's mixed-integer rounding (MIR) set and of Gunluk and Pochet's mixing-MIR set. Recently, it has been shown that linear optimization over CMMIR can be performed in polynomial time when the capacities are divisible. Here we show that when there are two different nondivisible capacities, linear optimization over CMMIR can be performed in polynomial time.</br>
