Title: Disco-Novo-GoGo: Integrating Local Search and Complete Search with Restarts<br>Author: Meinolf Sellmann, Assistant Professor, Brown University, 115 Waterman Street, PO Box 1910, Providence, RI, 02912, United States, sello@cs.brown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Carlos Ansotegui, Warren Schudy<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A hybrid algorithm is devised to boost the performance of complete search on under-constrained problems. We suggest to use random variable selection in combination with restarts, augmented by a coarse-grained local search algorithm that learns favorable value heuristics over the course of several restarts. Numerical results show that this method can speed-up complete search by orders of magnitude.
