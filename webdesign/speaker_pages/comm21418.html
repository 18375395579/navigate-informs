Title: Robust Multi-Armed Bandit Problems<br>Author: Michael Jong Kim, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of California Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Mail Code 1777, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, kimmi@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Lim<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a robust formulation of the classic multi-armed bandit problem of Whittle. We show that arms are no longer independent under the worst case model, even if they are independent under the nominal.  Robust versions of the Bellman (dynamic programming) equations are derived, and the optimality of a so-called project-by-project retirement (PPR) policy is established. Using the properties of the PPR policy, we show how performance bounds for suboptimal robust policies can be obtained.
