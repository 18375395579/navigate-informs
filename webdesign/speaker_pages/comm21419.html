Title: Pre-disaster Investment Decisions for China Railway Network under Flood Hazards<br>Author: Liu Hong, Associate Professor, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037#, Luoyu Road, Institute of System Engineering, Wuhan, HB, 430074, China, liu.hong@hust.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Min Ouyang, Srinivas Peeta, Zhezhe Pan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We address a pre-disaster planning problem seeks to select and prioritize links in China Railway Network to strengthen under a limited budget with the objective of maximizing the post-flood performance. A recursive decomposition algorithm is used to calculate the connectivity between stations based on link failure probabilities obtained through historical flood hazards and rail link flood damage data. Numerical experiments illustrate the tractability and effectiveness of the proposed method.
