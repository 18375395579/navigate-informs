Title: Acceleration Strategies for the Weight Constrained Shortest Path Problem with Replenishment<br>Author: Andrés L. Medaglia, Associate Professor, Universidad de los Andes, Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, COPA, Bogota, Colombia, amedagli@uniandes.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): Leonardo Lozano, Manuel Bolivar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The Weight Constrained Shortest Path Problem with Replenishment (WCSPP-R) generalizes the Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSP). We present an exact algorithm that extends the ideas proposed in the state-of-the-art algorithms for the CSP and WCSPP-R. The novelty relies in a set of acceleration strategies that significantly improves the algorithm performance. We conducted experiments over large real-road networks achieving considerable speedups against the state-of the-art algorithm.
