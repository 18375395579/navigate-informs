Title: Stochastic Day-ahead Unit Commitment with Dynamic Reserves Policies<br>Author: Garret LaBove, Research Assistant, Arizona State University, PO Box 875706, GWC 206 School of ECEE ASU, Tempe, AZ, 85287-5706, United States of America, garret@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kory Hedman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Decomposition techniques are routinely investigated to reduce the computational complexities associated with stochastic optimization. However, specific properties of power system operations management and scheduling introduce challenges that are not readily overcome by general solution techniques. This talk will demonstrate that dynamic reserve requirement policies can aid in addressing supply-side uncertainty of renewable generation assets in decomposed, stochastic day-ahead unit commitment.
