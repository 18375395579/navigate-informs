Title: Intelligently Allocating Resources to Interdict a Planar Supply Network<br>Author: H. Ric Blacksten, Senior Analyst, ANSER/Homeland Security Institute, 2900 S. Quincy St., Suite 800, Arlington, VA, 22206, United States of America, Harry.Blacksten@hsi.dhs.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Opponent’s supply networks arise for problems ranging from military logistics to narcotics/human/arms smuggling to information security.  In many cases these supply networks are planar, or can be decomposed into two or three planar subnetworks.  We show how the planar network interdiction problem can be reformulated and solved as a generalized shortest path problem on a dual network.  By “generalized?we mean that the solution will be made a function of interdiction resources available.
