In addition, we offer a number of algorithmic enhancements that streamline the implementation of the algorithm and render it efficient from a practical standpoint. Finally, a series of computational experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed implementation and the gains attained compared to the typically used Q-learning algorithm.</br>
