Title: Reconstructing the Path-delay Operator for the Continuous Time Dynamic User Equilibrium Problem<br>Author: Eric Richardson, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, United States of America, richae3@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Ban<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper we consider the path-based infinite dimensional variational inequality formulation of dynamic user equilibrium put forward by Friesz et al 1993 and the link-node based dynamic complementarity system formulation by Ban et al 2011.  We show that by properly defining the entry flow function put forth by Friesz et al 1993, we can reformulate the infinite dimensional variational inequality put forward by Friesz et al 1993 into a dynamic complementarity system of the form used by Ban et al 2011.  Using this result, we show that the path-delay operator proposed by Friesz et al 1993 can be reconstructed analytically from the link-queue dynamics of Ban et al 2011 providing a continuous time, analytical formulation of the path-delay operator.
