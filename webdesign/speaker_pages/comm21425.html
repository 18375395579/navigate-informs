Fowler Avenue, ENB118, Tampa, Fl, 33620, United States of America, felipefeijoo@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tapas Das</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Our game theoretic model analyzes the impact of design parameters of CO2 cap and trade policies on the performance of deregulated electricity networks. The performances include emissions, LMPs, consumption, generation and allowances allocation, and profits. We formulate the allowance and electricity markets as a bi-level continuous optimization problem and solve it using a MPEC/EPEC approach.</br>
