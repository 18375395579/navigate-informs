Title: Agent-based Traffic Optimization Model for Rail Terminal Management<br>Author: Tie Shi, Student, Southwest Jiaotong University/ University of Utah, MCE Building 2135, 110 S.

A Lagrangian relaxation based solution method is developed to decompose the original complex problem into a sequence of easy-to-solve linear programming problems.
