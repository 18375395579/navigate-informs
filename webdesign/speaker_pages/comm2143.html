Frequently, however, one can generate arbitrarily close approximations to the random object. We introduce a simple randomization idea for creating unbiased estimators in such a setting based on a sequence of approximations. Applying this idea to computing expectations of path functionals associated with stochastic differential equations (SDEs), we construct finite-variance unbiased estimators with a square root convergence rate for a general class of multi-dimensional SDEs. We then identify the optimal randomization distribution. Numerical experiments with various path functionals of continuous-time processes that often arise in finance illustrate the effectiveness of our new approach.</br>
