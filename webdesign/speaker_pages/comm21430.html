Title: Assortment Optimization under Variants of the Nested Logit Choice Model<br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Cornell University, 223 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, ht88@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guillermo Gallego, James Davis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider assortment optimization problems under several variants of the nested logit model. Under the assumption that the no-purchase is not available in each nest and the so-called nest dissimilarity parameters are between zero and one, we show that we can compute the optimal assortment in polynomial time. The problem is NP-hard when we relax either one of these assumptions. We explore approximation methods for the NP-hard versions of the problem.
