To date, none of these researchers manage to offer efficient solution methodologies that meet the practical needs of industry practitioners. This paper aims to bridge the application gap by introducing a novel solution methodology that can efficiently solve tanker routing and scheduling problem with account of all key operating constraints.</br>
