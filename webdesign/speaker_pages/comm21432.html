Title: Local Multidimensional Scaling for Nonlinear Dimension Reduction, Graph Layout & Proximity Analysis<br>Author: Andreas Buja, The Liem Sioe Liong/First Pacific Company Professor of Statistics, University of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School, Department of Statistics, 3730 Walnut Street, 400 JMHH, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, buja@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lisha Chen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We introduce a new nonlinear dimension reduction method, called Local Multidimensional Scaling (LMDS). Its novel feature is that it uses ideas from the area of graph layout to balance attractive forces between near points and repulsive forces between non-near points against each other. Our methods generally do a superior job compared with LLE and Isomap. Our work contributes to, and ties together, three areas: non-linear dimension reduction, graph layout, and proximity analysis.
