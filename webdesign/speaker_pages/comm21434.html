<br>Title: Student Paper Award Winner: Efficient Methods for Stochastic Composite Optimization</br><br>Author: Guanghui Lan, Georgia Tech, School of ISyE, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, glan@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers an important class of convex programming problems whose objective functions, given by the summation of a smooth and non-smooth component, are contaminated by stochastic noise. We show that the robust stochastic approximation method exhibits the best-known rate of convergence for solving these problems. The main goal is to present the first theoretically optimal method for solving this class of problems and demonstrate its significant advantages over existing algorithms.</br>
