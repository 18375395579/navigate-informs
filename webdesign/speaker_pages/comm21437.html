Title: Polyhedral Results for an Equal-split Network Flow Problem<br>Author: Shabbir Ahmed, Georgia Institute of Technology, sahmed@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joel Sokol, Amandeep Parmar<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a network flow problem where flow out of a node has to be equally split across the chosen out-going arcs. Several families of cutting planes are developed for an integer programming formulation of the problem, and these cuts are integrated within a branch-and-cut scheme. Computational results from an application in communication networks is presented.
