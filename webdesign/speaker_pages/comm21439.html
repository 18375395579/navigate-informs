Title: Cutting Planes for The Multi-stage Stochastic Unit Commitment Problem<br>Author: Ruiwei Jiang, University of Florida, 411 Weil Hall, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, rwjiang@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yongpei Guan, Jean-Paul Watson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Motivated by the intermittency of renewable energy, we propose a multi-stage stochastic integer programming model in this talk to address unit commitment problems under uncertainty, for which we construct several classes of strong inequalities by lifting procedures to strengthen the original formulation. Our preliminary computational experiments show encouraging results.
