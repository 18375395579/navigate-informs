Title: New Filter Methods for Large-Scale Optimization<br>Author: Sven Leyffer, Computational Mathematician, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S. Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States, leyffer@mcs.anl.gov<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a new active set method for large-scale nonlinear optimization. The method employs an unconstrained minimization to identify the optimal active set followed by an equality QP solve to promote fast local convergence. We enforce global convergence through the use of a trust-region and a filter.
