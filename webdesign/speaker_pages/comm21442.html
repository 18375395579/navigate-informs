However, since the form of the value function is unknown, existing techniques tend to avoid dynamic programming. We derive an analytic solution, revealing that the optimal value function is the upper envelope of a set of linear combinations of Dirichlets. We also propose an effective approximate dynamic programming algorithm, called Beetle, which takes advantage of this analytical form.</br>
