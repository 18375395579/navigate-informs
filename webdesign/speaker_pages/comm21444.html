Title: Solving Airline Scheduling Problems with Benders Decomposition<br>Author: Yufeng Yao, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332<br>Coauthor(s): Özlem Ergun, Ellis Johnson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: One of the major objectives for airline scheduling is to cover all customer demand with minimum operating costs and high utilization of its resources. We propose an integrated model and solution methodology to simultaneously solve the fleet assignment, aircraft routing, and crew scheduling problems. For small size instances, column generation can be used. However, for larger size instances, the Benders decomposition gives more efficient and effective results.
