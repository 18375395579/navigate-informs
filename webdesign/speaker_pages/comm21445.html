Title: Train Design Optimization in a Congested Railroad Network<br>Author: Abdullah Al Khaled, PhD Student, Mississippi State University, Dept. of Industrial and Systems Engg., McCain Engineering Building, PO Box 9542, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, United States of America, ak511@msstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mingzhou Jin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Train design in railways consists of two tasks: block-to-train assignment and train routing. It seeks to identify optimal routes for trains and their associated blocks and is subject to various capacity and operational constraints at tracks and yards. A mixed integer program is formulated for this problem considering nonlinear relationship between travel time and volume in a congested network. A two-stage heuristic algorithm is proposed to attack the computational burden for real-world networks.
