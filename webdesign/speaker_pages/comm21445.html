It seeks to identify optimal routes for trains and their associated blocks and is subject to various capacity and operational constraints at tracks and yards. A mixed integer program is formulated for this problem considering nonlinear relationship between travel time and volume in a congested network. A two-stage heuristic algorithm is proposed to attack the computational burden for real-world networks.</br>
