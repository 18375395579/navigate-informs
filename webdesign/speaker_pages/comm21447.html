Title: Using Lattice Basis Reduction to Compute General Disjunctions in Practice<br>Author: Sanjay Mehrotra, Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd., Evanston, IL, United States of America, mehrotra@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kuo-Ling Huang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We will present results from a practical implementation of general disjunction algorithm using the Mehrotra and Li approach for solving general mixed integer convex programs.  This method uses log-barrier ellipsoidal approximation for the continuous relaxation and performs Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovaz lattice basis reduction methods as a core to find a good branching direction.  Computational results show significant difference in branch-and-bound nodes in many problems.
