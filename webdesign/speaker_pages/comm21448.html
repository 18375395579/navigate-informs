Without outliers, the classical Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) can be used to estimate parameters of known distribution from observation data. With the presence of outliers, the log likelihood function is dominated by outliers such that the MLE estimators are pulled toward outliers. There is an extensive literature in robust statistics. However, the methods proposed suffer either from computational complexity when problem size increases or from giving up desirable properties such as affine equivariance. We take a different approach compared to existing methods where we try to and the optimal probability of occurrence for all the observations such that at the optimal solution, outliers are set with smaller probabilities and can be detected. The optimization problem is designed such that the optimal probability measure is consistent with the probability densities of the observations given the normal behavior of the non-outlier subset. Our robust covariance estimator has the following properties: First, it is affine equivariant. Second, it is computational efficient even for large problem sizes, both in the number of observations as we as the problem dimension. Third, our method is easy to incorporate prior belief into the estimators. We test the accuracy of our method for different contamination models including the most recently proposed ones. We found our method is not only faster than the Fast-MCD method but also slightly more accurate for high dimensional data.</br>
