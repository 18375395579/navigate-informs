We present a tractable relaxation of an exact formulation that yields a feasible solution and an upper bound on the optimal value. The relaxation is based on a fluid approximation and dynamic display strategy. It can be solved by identifying efficient inventory levels. The method performs well compared to existing methods and provides tighter optimality gap bounds.</br>
