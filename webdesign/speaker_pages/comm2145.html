Title: The Multi-product Newsvendor Problem with Consumer Choice<br>Author: Joonkyum Lee, Doctoral Student, Cornell University, 301A Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, jl883@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amr Farahat<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We address the muti-product newsvendor problem under a general consumer choice behavior, e.g., substitution and choice overload. We present a tractable relaxation of an exact formulation that yields a feasible solution and an upper bound on the optimal value. The relaxation is based on a fluid approximation and dynamic display strategy. It can be solved by identifying efficient inventory levels. The method performs well compared to existing methods and provides tighter optimality gap bounds.
