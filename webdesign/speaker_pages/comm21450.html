Title: Exact and Approximation Algorithms for Finding the Nadir Point<br>Author: Murat Koksalan, METU, IE Dept., METU, Ankara, Turkey, koksalan@metu.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Banu Lokman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Finding the nadir point is hard for more than three objectives.  The difficulty further increases for integer programming problems. We develop an exact and an approximation algorithm to find the nadir point in multi-objective integer programs. We demonstrate on several instances of multi-objective assignment, knapsack, and shortest path problems that the algorithms work well.
