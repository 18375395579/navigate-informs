Title: Network Design under Worst Interdiction Scenario<br>Author: Churlzu Lim, UNC Charlotte, 9201 University City Blvd, Charlotte, NC, United States of America, clim2@uncc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cole Smith<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Consider a network design problem in which an intelligent enemy optimally destroys arcs to minimize the weighted sum of flows. We first present the enemy’s strategy that finds an optimal interdiction by solving a series of integer bilinear programs. Noting that considering a finite solution space is sufficient in the enemy’s problem, we employ a cutting plane algorithm to identify an optimal network design. Computational results for solving randomly generated test instances will be reported.
