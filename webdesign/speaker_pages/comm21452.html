We first present the enemy’s strategy that finds an optimal interdiction by solving a series of integer bilinear programs. Noting that considering a finite solution space is sufficient in the enemy’s problem, we employ a cutting plane algorithm to identify an optimal network design. Computational results for solving randomly generated test instances will be reported.</br>
