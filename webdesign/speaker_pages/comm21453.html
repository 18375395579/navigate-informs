On  a universe of n elements, m invocations of the algorithm require  a total of O(n log n+mk log(n/k)) time. We show that the  expected value of k is significantly smaller than n on several  interesting input distributions. After a theoretical study, we introduce  heuristic enhancements and demonstrate the new algorithm’s  performance experimentally.</br>
