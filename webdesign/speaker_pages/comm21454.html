Title: The Linear Programming Polytope of Binary Constraint Problems with Bounded Tree-Width<br>Author: Meinolf Sellmann, Assistant Professor, Brown University, sello@cs.brown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Leventhal, Luc Mercier<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We show how to efficiently model binary constraint problems (BCP)  as integer programs. After considering tree-structured BCPs first, we show that a Sherali-Adams-like procedure results in a polynomial-size linear programming description of the convex hull of all integer feasible solutions when the BCP that is given has bounded tree-width.
