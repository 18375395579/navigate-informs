<br>Title: Interior Point Approach  to Linear Optimization: Theory and Algorithms</br><br>Author: Tamás Terlaky, Professor, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, L8S4K1, Canada, terlaky@mcmaster.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kees Roos, Jean-Philippe Vial</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: An interior point approach to both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of interior point methods for linear optimization. The first part presents duality theory and a simple polynomial IPM  with full complexity and roundig analysis for solving linear optimization problems. Remainder discusses logarithmic barrier methods, target-following approaches, predictor-corrector approaches, sensitity analysis and implementation issues.</br>
