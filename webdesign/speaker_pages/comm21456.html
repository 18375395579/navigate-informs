Title: Warm Starting for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs)<br>Author: Menal Guzelsoy, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Ave, Room 362, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, megb@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Warm starting is a technique used to start the solution procedure of a modified MILP from an advanced state using data generated from execution of a previous solution procedure. Methods for warm starting are useful in cases where solution of a family of related MILPs is required. In this talk, we will consider various warm starting approaches appropriate  for MILP families parameterized over different parts of the input data.
