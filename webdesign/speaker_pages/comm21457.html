Title: Incorporating Network Considerations into System-level Maintenance Decision-making for Pavements<br>Author: Aditya Medury, PhD Candidate, University of California, Berkeley, 1910 Berryman St., Apt 101, Berkeley, CA, 94709, United States of America, amedury@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samer Madanat<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The state-of-the-art Markov decision process-based approaches in infrastructure management, while optimal for solving budget allocation problems, become sub-optimal upon introducing network constraints. An approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework is proposed, wherein capacity losses due to construction activities are subjected to a network capacity threshold. A parametric study is conducted on a stylized network to infer the impact of network constraints on the decision-making process.
