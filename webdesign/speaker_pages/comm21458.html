<br>Title: A New Optimization Approach to Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Structural Models</br><br>Author: Che-Lin Su, Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, CMS-EMS, Kellogg, Northwestern University, 580 Leverone Hall, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, c-su@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kenneth Judd</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimation of structural models is regarded as computationally difficult. This impression is due to a focus on the Rust's Nested Fixed-Point (NFXP) approach. We present a direct optimization approach to the problem and show that it is significantly faster than the NFXP approach when applied to the canonical Zurcher bus repair model. The direct optimization approach is also applicable to other structural estimation problems such as Nash games, auctions and RBC models.</br>
