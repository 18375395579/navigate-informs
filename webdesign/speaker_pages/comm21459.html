<br>Title: IP Column Generation for a Service Deployment Problem</br><br>Author: Anders N. Gullhav, PhD Candidate, NTNU, Dept. of Industrial Economics and Tech., Trondheim, 7491, Norway, anders.gullhav@iot.ntnu.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bjorn Nygreen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Providers of cloud software services are concerned about being cost-efficient in their service delivery, while providing a quality of service in accordance with the end-users' requirements. We present an IP column generation formulation for a service deployment problem considering response time and availability requirements and the operational costs of the service provider. Our results show that a column generation approach provides better solutions more quickly than a direct formulation.</br>
