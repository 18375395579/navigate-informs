Title: On Bounded Mixed Integer Bilinear Terms<br>Author: Akshay Gupte, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, Martin Hall, Clemson, SC, United States of America, agupte3@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Ahmed, Santanu Dey<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a single bounded bilinear term written as a product of two bounded variables, both integer or one continous and one integer. Binary representation of one integer variable produces a mixed integer linear set in an extended space. We show different ways of obtaining valid inequalities for this set using knapsack covers and polymatroids of a submodular function.
