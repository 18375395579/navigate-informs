<br>Title: Solving the Minimum Energy Broadcasting Problem in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks by Integer Programming</br><br>Author: Keumseok Kang, Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, 403 W. State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907-2056, United States, kangk@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kemal Altinkemer, Sibel Salman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the minimum energy broadcasting problem in ad hoc wireless networks. For this NP-hard problem, we propose a new integer programming formulation based on a set covering model and a Lagrangian relaxation procedure to solve the problem. We provide extensive computational tests.</br>
