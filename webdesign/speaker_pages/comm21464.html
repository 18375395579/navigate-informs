<br>Title: An Integrated Disruption Recovery Approach with Passenger Recovery and Cruise Speed Decisions</br><br>Author: Ugur Arikan, Research Assistant, Middle East Technical University, Universiteler Mh, Dumlupinar Blv, No:1, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, arikanu@metu.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sinan Gurel, M. Selim Akturk</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new network-flow based model for the integrated airline disruption recovery problem. We consider detailed passenger recovery and cruise speed decisions along with other well-known aircraft and crew recovery actions. We propose a mixed integer conic quadratic programming formulation solved in reasonable CPU times for practical size problems.</br>
