Selim Akturk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a new network-flow based model for the integrated airline disruption recovery problem. We consider detailed passenger recovery and cruise speed decisions along with other well-known aircraft and crew recovery actions. We propose a mixed integer conic quadratic programming formulation solved in reasonable CPU times for practical size problems.
