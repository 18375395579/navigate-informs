These routes respect the unloading sequence of boxes three-dimensionally packaged into the container. This method uses Ngoi et al (1994) spatial matrix representation, extending it to the selection box strategy by Gehring et al (1990). The heuristic performs well both in quality of the results and in response time.</br>
