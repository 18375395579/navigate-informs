It utilizes coevolutionary algorithms to concurrently search the solution spaces of rerouting strategies and hazardous weather scenarios. By using this approach, air traffic managers can achieve two key strategic objectives: identification of robust rerouting methods and vulnerabilities of the NAS with respect to certain weather conditions.</br>
