The efficient are uniquely determined by the desired adjusted markups, which are also linked to a common variable at the nested level. The product selection search space is reduced to the set of efficient assortments of polynomial size. Finally, the joint optimization can be reduced to a single-dimensional problem with jump-up discontinuity.</br>
