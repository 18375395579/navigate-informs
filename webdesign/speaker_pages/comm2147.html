Title: Mechanism for Robust Procurements<br>Author: Yingqian Zhang, Assistant Professor, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Burg. Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, 3062 PA, Netherlands, yqzhang@ese.eur.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Sicco Verwer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We model robust procurement as an optimization problem. We show this problem is NP-complete, and propose a backtracking algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose a multi-stage mechanism that is truthful, efficient, and post-execution individually rational. In the experiments, we compare our mechanism with an iterated greedy mechanism that represents the current practice in public procurements, in terms of the expected social welfare and the expected payments of the auctioneer.
