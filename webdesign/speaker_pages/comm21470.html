This problem subsumes important objectives like project duration, activity-in-progress costs, and manufacturing settings like flow shops and job shops. We develop efficient tight lower bounds, near-optimal heuristics, and perform extensive computational experiments to assess the performance of our algorithms on randomly generated networks.</br>
