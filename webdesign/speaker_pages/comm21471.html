<br>Title: Constraint Programming in AIMMS</br><br>Author: Deanne Zhang, AIMMS, 500 108th ave ne, ste 1780, Bellevue, WA, 98005, United States of America, Deanne.Zhang@aimms.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gertjan de Lange</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Constraint Programming is a paradigm useful in formulating and solving highly combinatorial problems in addition to MIP solvers. With the Constraint Programing functionalities in AIMMS, we are able to take advantage of both ?by combining the two methods together to solve a combinatorial problem. We will compare the different formulations, use different solving techniques, and analyze the results using the tools in AIMMS.</br>
