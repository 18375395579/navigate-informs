Title: Generating All Efficient Solutions for Bi-criteria Multi Resource Assignment Problem<br>Author: Ozlem Karsu, PhD Student, London School of Economics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom, O.Karabulut@lse.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Meral Azizoglu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this study we consider a multi resource assignment problem. Our aim is to generate all efficient solutions with respect to two criteria: total assignment load and maximum assignment load over all agents.  We propose several lower and upper bounds and use them in our optimization and approximation algorithms. The computational results show satisfactory behaviours of our approaches.
