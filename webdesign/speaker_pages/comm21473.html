The objective is to minimize the makespan. We show that the problem with 2-period maintenances can be reformulated as a double knapsack problem and is NP-hard. A fast heuristic is proposed to find a near optimal solution subject to arbitrary relative errors. Numerical studies are implemented to verify the corresponding computational time subject to the given relative errors.
