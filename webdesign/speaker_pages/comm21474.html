Title: Operational Stand and Gate Allocation<br>Author: Tor Fog Justesen, Industrial PhD student, Copenhagen Airports A/S, Lufthavnsboulevarden 6, Kastrup, 2770, Denmark, tor.justesen@cph.dk<br>Coauthor(s): Jesper Larsen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We address the handling of aircraft turn-rounds in airports at the operational level. The processes involved in the handling of a turn-round require different ground handling resources at different times. Each resource can be claimed by at most one turn-round at a time. We develop a flexible set packing-based model formulation of the problem and a solution algorithm in which columns are generated by a KPI-based column generator to provide near-optimal feasible solutions efficiently.
