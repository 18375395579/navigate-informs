<br>Title: Two-stage Robust Network Design with Exponential Scenarios</br><br>Author: Vahab Mirrokni, Google Research, New York, NY, United States of America, mirrokni@theory.csail.mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rohit Khandekar, MohammadReza Salavatipour, Guy Kortsarz</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study two-stage robust variants of network design problems. We focus on the case of {\em exponentially many} scenarios given implicitly. We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for the two-stage robust Steiner tree and robust uncapacitated facility location problems and an $O(\log n)$-approximation for robust Steiner forest problem. We conclude our results by several inapproximability results for these problems.</br>
