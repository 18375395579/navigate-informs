<br>Title: Protein Structure Alignment via Contact Map Overlap Maximization</br><br>Author: Wei Xie, Operations Research Consultant, American Airlines OR&DS Group, 4255 Amon Carter Blvd, MD 4453, BO Box 619616, Fort Worth, TX, 76155, United States of America, Wei.Xie@aa.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nick Sahinidis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Protein structure alignment is an important technique to study protein structures and functions, and contact map overlap maximization provides an accurate and reliable way to align protein structures.  In this talk, we present a global optimization algorithm that incorporates branch-and-bound, domain reduction, and local search to solve this challenging biological problem.</br>
