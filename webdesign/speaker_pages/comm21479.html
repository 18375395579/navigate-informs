Title: A Long Haul Freight Network Design Framework and Associated Branch and Bound Solution Method<br>Coauthor(s): Amelia Regan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The Network Design Problem is to choose the set of improvement alternatives to optimize efficiency. Previous work focuses mainly on efficient algorithms for the highway network while our objective is to formulate and solve the network design problem for multi-modal long haul freight networks. Shipper-carrier freight flow prediction is performed along with the branch and bound algorithm.
