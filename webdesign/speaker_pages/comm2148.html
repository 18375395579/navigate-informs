Title: A  Metaheuristic for a Territory Design Problem under Stochastic Demands<br>Author: Mónica Elizondo-Amaya, Ph.

A stochastic integer programming model is introduced. The objective is to minimize the territory imbalances with respect to product demand subject to planning criteria such as territory connectivity, compactness, and balance with respect to the number of customers. A metaheuristic for large instances is developed and empirically evaluated.
