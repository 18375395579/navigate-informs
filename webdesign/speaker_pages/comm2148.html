<br>Title: A  Metaheuristic for a Territory Design Problem under Stochastic Demands</br><br>Author: Mónica Elizondo-Amaya, Ph. D. student, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, Graduate Program in Systems Engineering, AP 111 ?F, Cd. Universitaria., San Nicolas de los Garza, NL, 66450, Mexico, melizondo.amaya@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roger Rios</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A stochastic version of a commercial territory design problem in presence of uncertain demands is addressed. A stochastic integer programming model is introduced. The objective is to minimize the territory imbalances with respect to product demand subject to planning criteria such as territory connectivity, compactness, and balance with respect to the number of customers. A metaheuristic for large instances is developed and empirically evaluated.</br>
