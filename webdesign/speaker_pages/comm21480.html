Title: Power Gird Vulnerability Analysis with MIP approximated AC Optimal Power Flow<br>Author: Wei Yuan, United States of America, weiyuan@mail.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Due to lack of algorithm to cope with the non-convex AC optimal power flow problem, the optimal power flow problem is often formulated as a linearized DC optimal power flow problem.  However, this approach is often criticized because the DC optimal power flow fails to capture key features of the physical power grid, which may lead to a non-optimal vulnerability analysis. In this paper, we propose to use MIP to approximate the AC power flow problem to better capture the physics of power grid.
