<br>Title: Branch-and-cut (BAC) Based Decomposition for SIP with Mixed-integer Variables in Both Stages</br><br>Author: Yang Yuan, The Ohio State University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Columbus, OH, United States of America, yuan.65@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Suvrajeet Sen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A Branch-and-Cut approach to decomposition of SIP problems refers to a class of decomposition methods in which the cost-to-go value function is approximated through branching and cutting within the second stage IP. In this talk, we will discuss a method which allows branching based on objective functions in both stages.</br>
