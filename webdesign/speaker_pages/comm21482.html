Title: Branch-and-cut (BAC) Based Decomposition for SIP with Mixed-integer Variables in Both Stages<br>Author: Yang Yuan, The Ohio State University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Columbus, OH, United States of America, yuan.65@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Suvrajeet Sen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A Branch-and-Cut approach to decomposition of SIP problems refers to a class of decomposition methods in which the cost-to-go value function is approximated through branching and cutting within the second stage IP. In this talk, we will discuss a method which allows branching based on objective functions in both stages.
