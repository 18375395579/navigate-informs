Cole Smith, Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The edge partitioning problem is inspired by a SONET design problem, and considers the partitioning of a graph's edge set into a set of subgraphs. Each subgraph is limited by the (weighted) sum of edges and number of nodes assigned to it.  This talk considers a stochastic version of the problem in which there are several scenarios regarding edge weights. We formulate this problem as an MIP, and prescribe a two-stage cutting-plane approach with binary variables in both stages.</br>
