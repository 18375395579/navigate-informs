Title: Technician Routing with Learning<br>Author: Xi Chen, University of Iowa, S321 John Pappajohn Business Building, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, xi-chen-3@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mike Hewitt, Barrett Thomas<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We introduce the technician routing problem with experience-based learning. We present a solution method assigns jobs to technicians over the planning horizon thus directing learning. We compare the approach to a daily decomposition. Computational experiments demonstrate the value of incorporating learning and the effectiveness of the approach.
