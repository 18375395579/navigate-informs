Denmark, ulf.worsoe@mosek.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A geometric programing (GP) problem can be formulated as a convex nonlinear optimisation problem having a special structure, which means that it may be solved to optimality. A number of practical problems, e.g in analog circuit design, can be approximately modelled as geometric programming problems. In this talk we discuss how to formulate and solve large scale geometric programing problems with the software package MOSEK (www.mosek.com), and show some test results.</br>
