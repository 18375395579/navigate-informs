PICO and PEBBL were built to exploit the thousands of processors available on DOE's massively-parallel machines, but they can run in serial. We will emphasize recent new capabilities such as checkpointing, enumeration of near-optimal solutions, cut support, performance enhancement, and software quality activities.</br>
