Title: PICO: Parallel Integer and Combinatorial Optimizer<br>Author: Cynthia Phillips, Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 1110, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1110, United States, caphill@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Eckstein, William Hart<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We will summarize the capabilities of the PICO mixed-integer programming solver and PEBBL, the general branch-and-bound framework upon which PICO is built.  PICO and PEBBL were built to exploit the thousands of processors available on DOE's massively-parallel machines, but they can run in serial. We will emphasize recent new capabilities such as checkpointing, enumeration of near-optimal solutions, cut support, performance enhancement, and software quality activities.
