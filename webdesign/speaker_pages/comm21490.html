The main idea is to let the filter play the major role when convexity is present and to fall back on the classical trust-region method only if things do not go well or if non-convexity is encountered. We will mainly analyze the use of approximate derivatives in the algorithm. Numerical experiments carried out on small-scaled unconstrained problems will be presented.</br>
