Title: Quantifying the Value of Information for Inferring Contagion Patterns in Social Activity Graphs<br>Author: Lauren Gardner, Lecturer, University of New South Wales, UNSW, Sydney, 2052, Australia, laurengardner84@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): David Fajardo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The model presented here seeks to predict the infection pattern which depicts the current state of the network for an ongoing outbreak of a communicable disease. This is accomplished by inferring the most likely path of infection through a contact network under the assumption of partially available infection data. The problem is formulated as a bi-linear integer program, and heuristic solution methods are developed based on iteration of two sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently.
