Title: Decomposition Method for Mixed Integer Linear Bi-level<br>Author: George Saharidis, Research Associate, Rutgers University, 98 Brett Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08540, United States, saharidis@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Marianthi Ierapetritou<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The majority  of scientific results in bi-level optimization has  focused in the linear version of the problem. The mixed integer  linear bi-level problem (MILBP) continues to be a difficult task.  We present a new approach in order to solve MILBP based on  decomposition methodology.
