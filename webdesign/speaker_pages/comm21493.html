Title: Applications of A Probability Programming Language (APPL)<br>Author: Diane Evans, diane.evans@rose-hulman.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Leemis, Andrew Glen, John Drew<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Probability theory uses algebra and calculus to solve problems involving random variables from the sciences, engineering, and business.  Many results in probability have been derived as a means to approximate quantities that are difficult to determine exactly due to lengthy or intractable mathematics. This talk introduces the Maple-based software tool APPL that was designed to manipulate random variables.  The functionality of APPL will be highlighted through examples and applications.
