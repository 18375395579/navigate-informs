Many results in probability have been derived as a means to approximate quantities that are difficult to determine exactly due to lengthy or intractable mathematics. This talk introduces the Maple-based software tool APPL that was designed to manipulate random variables.  The functionality of APPL will be highlighted through examples and applications.</br>
