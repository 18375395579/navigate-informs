Motivated by this data rich paradigm, we propose a novel schema to utilize data to design uncertainty sets for robust optimization by using hypothesis tests.  Models built with our new sets are computationally tractable, and their solutions enjoy a finite-sample probabilistic guarantee.  Through applications in portfolio management and queueing, we show that our data-driven sets outperform conventional sets whenever data is available.
