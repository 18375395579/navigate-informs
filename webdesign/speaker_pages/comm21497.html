Title: A New Open-source Implementation of the Double Description Method<br>Author: Brian Dandurand, Clemson University, Dept. of Mathematical Sciences, Martin Hall, Box 340975, Clemson, SC, 29634-0975, United States of America, bdandur@clemson,edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Saltzman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe an implementation of the double description algorithm for enumerating vertices and rays of polyhedra.  This capability can be very useful in understanding how to exploit polyhedral structure in the development of optimization algorithms.    We describe refinements to the basic algorithm that enable our code to outperform existing implementations.  Our code will be contributed to the COIN-OR library of open-source software for operations research.
