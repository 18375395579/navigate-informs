Title: On Generating Cuts for Facial Solutions<br>Author: Sanjay Mehrotra, Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 sheridan road, Evanston, il, 60201, United States of America, mehrotra@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Huanyuan Sheng<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We will present methods for generating cuts for facial solution of integer programming problems.  These cuts  are generated from exploring lattices associated with the sub-faces of a given face.  A lattice characterization of the cuts is also given.
