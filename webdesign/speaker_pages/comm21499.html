In the 1st stage, we process the exisiting SDPs into equivalent problems in the block-angular form. In the 2nd stage, we solve the block-angular SDP in a parallel and iterative interior point decomposition framework. We will present our computational experiences with the algorithm on a parallel and distributed cluster of workstations.</br>
