Title: Sampled Fictitious Play Heuristics for Discrete Optimization Problems<br>Author: Marina Epelman, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, mepelman@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Smith, Archis Ghate<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Sampled Fictitious Play is a heuristic for solving large-scale discrete optimization problems. We consider both traditional large-scale discrete problems, and problems modeling complex systems. We describe several versions of the algorithm, discuss their theoretical convergence guarantees, and demonstrate their computational efficiency on various problems, with applications ranging from transportation and operations management, to finite horizon, Markov decision problems.
