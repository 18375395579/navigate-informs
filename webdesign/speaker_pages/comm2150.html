<br>Title: Column Generation Approaches to a Robust Airline Crew Pairing Problem for Managing Extra Flights</br><br>Author: Guvenc Sahin, Assistant Professor, Sabanci University, Manufacturing Systems/Industrial Eng., Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, -, 34956, Turkey, guvencs@sabanciuniv.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Ilker Birbil, Kerem Bulbul, Ibrahim Muter, Elvin Coban, Duygu Tas, Dilek Tuzun Aksu, Husnu Yenigun</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a robust version of the airline crew pairing problem. The selected pairings are not only to cover the regular flights but also to provide solutions to cover some potential extra flights, which may be introduced into the schedule during operation at a later point in time. For this robust model, we propose four column generation approaches along with required modifications to the multi-label shortest path problem for pricing. We conduct numerical experiments on three test instances.</br>
