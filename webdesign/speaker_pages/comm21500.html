Title: The Mixing Set with Cardinality Constraints<br>Author: Simge Kucukyavuz, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, Systems and Industrial Engineering, Tucson, AZ, United States of America, simge@sie.arizona.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose valid inequalities for the mixing set with cardinality (and kanpsack) constraints. This set was recently studied by Luedtke et. al in the context of probabilistic linear programming. We show that our inequalities subsume the inequalities proposed earlier for related polyhedra. We give polynomial-time separation algorithms for our inequalities. Finally, we present a summary of our computational experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed inequalities.
