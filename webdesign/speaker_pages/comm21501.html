Title: Fast Receding Horizon Methods for Hedging High Dimensional Options<br>Author: James Primbs, Stanford University, japrimbs@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present receding horizon dynamic hedging methods designed for high dimensional option hedging.  Receding horizon methods repeatedly solve optimization problems in order to construct a hedging policy.  In this talk, we provide and compare formulations designed to efficiently handle very high dimensional options.
