Title: Closed Loop Supply Chain Network Design Problem with Multi-Product Remanufacturing<br>Author: Gopalakrishnan Easwaran, PhD Student, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, egopalakrishnan@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Halit Uster, Elif Akcali, Sila Cetinkaya<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a remanufacturing network design problem under the closed loop supply chain setting. We provide mathematical formulation for optimization of strategic decisions involving facility locations and coordinated product flows in the forward and reverse channels of this network. We develop efficient solution procedures based on decomposition approaches. We also present computational results on the performance of the solution methods for test problem instances.
