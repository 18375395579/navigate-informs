Rogers Way, Engineering Building #20, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, guzinb@sie.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peguy Pierre-Louis, David Morton</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A classic approximation scheme for stochastic programs calculates refined deterministic upper and lower bounds on the objective function value via Jensen’s and Edmundson-Madansky (EM) inequalities. In this talk, we present a method that replaces the computationally burdensome EM bound with sampling. We provide stopping rules that ensure the quality of the obtained solutions. We employ a control variate for variance reduction and present computational results.</br>
