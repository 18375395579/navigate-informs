Title: A Conic Interior Point Decomposition Approach for Block Angular Semidefinite Programs<br>Author: Kartik Krishnan Sivaramakrishnan, Assistant Professor, Department of Mathematics, North Carolina State University, Box 8205, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States, kksivara@ncsu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We recently developed a conic IPM approach for block angular SDPs. The idea is to solve such an SDP using existing primal-dual IPMs in an iterative fashion between a mixed conic master problem over linear and smaller dimensional semidefinite cones; and decomposed and distributed subproblems (smaller SDPs) in a high performance computing environment. In this talk, we present our algorithm, discuss issues for an efficient implementation, and also our computational experiences with the algorithm.
