Title: Minimizing Weighted Completion Time on a Two-Machine Flowshop<br>Author: Ya-Mei Tian, PhD Student, National Chiao Tung University, Institute of Information Management, 1001 University Road, Hsinchu, 300, Taiwan, ytian2@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Bertrand M.T. Lin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This study considers minimizing weighted completion time in a two-machine flowshop. In view of strong NP-hardness,an efficient exact solution algorithm is demanded. Several branch-and-bound algorithms for the uni-weighted counterpart have been suggested in the literature. We propose a branch-and-bound algorithm incorporating a lower bound and several dominance properties for the weighted version. Computational experiments demonstrate improvement of execution time for composing optimal solutions.
