<br>Title: On Minimal Valid Inequalities for Mixed Integer Conic Programs</br><br>Author: Fatma Kilinc-Karzan, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, fkilinc@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study structured mixed integer sets with a general regular cone and introduce minimal inequalities. Under mild assumptions, these inequalities together with the trivial conic ones are sufficient to describe convex hull. We study their characterization via necessary, and sufficient conditions for an inequality to be minimal; and establish relations with the support functions of sets with certain structure, which leads to efficient ways of showing a given inequality is minimal.</br>
