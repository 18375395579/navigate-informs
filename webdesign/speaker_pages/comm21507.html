Title: Reformulation Techniques for Solving Non-linear Workforce Planning Models with Learning<br>Author: Mike Hewitt, Assistant Professor, Loyola University Chicago, 1 E. Pearson, Chicago, IL, 60611, United States of America, mrheie@rit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Scott Grasman, Austin Chacosky, Barrett Thomas<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The literature on human learning suggests that quantitative, descriptive models of human learning are non-linear. As a result, prescriptive planning models are difficult to solve. We present a reformulation technique that models non-linear learning functions with sets of binary and linear variables and constraints. With this technique, we are able to solve problems in reasonable runtimes that are significantly larger than what has been previously possible.
