Title: Solving the Pareto-improving Toll Problem<br>Author: Siriphong Lawphongpanich, University of Florida, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, lawphong@ise.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Congestion tolls are said to be Pareto-improving if they lead to an improvement in travel delay or social benefit and ensure that no user is worse off when compared to the situation without any tolling.  The problem of finding Pareto-improving tolls can be formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints.  Using concepts from manifold suboptimization, we propose a new algorithm that converges to a strongly stationary solution in a finite number of iterations.
