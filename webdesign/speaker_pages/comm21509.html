We first subdivided the graph into smaller subgraphs, then use a regularized SDP relaxation method to localize each subgraph. Finally, the clusters are assembled together. We test our method on finding the 3D molecular configurations of proteins based on limited number of given pairwise distances between atoms. The results show that our method is robust and efficient.</br>
