Title: Lagrangian Branch and Cut for Optimization of Nonconvex MINLP Hierarchical Systems<br>Author: Jeremy Michalek, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Scaife Hall 323, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, jmichalek@cmu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We address a class of nonconvex MINLP problems for the design of systems composed of a hierarchy of subsystems by applying a Lagrangian branch and cut algorithm. We demonstrate the approach using two examples: product family optimization and hierarchical layout optimization, and we compare efficiency and optimality.
