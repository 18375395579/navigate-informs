<br>Title: Algorithms for the Design of a Relay Network in Truckload Trucking</br><br>Author: Halit Uster, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, United States, uster@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panitan Kewcharoenwong</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In order to address the the driver turnover problem in truckload transportation at the strategic level, we consider the design of a relay network which allows drivers to mainly operate in their domiciles. We develop a mathematical model which determines the relay point locations along with the routing decisions and provide efficient algorithms for its solution. We also present computational results illustrating the efficiency of the approaches.</br>
