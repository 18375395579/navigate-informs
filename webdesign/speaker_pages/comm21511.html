Barry Liu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We investigate methods for solving the Stochastic Ground Holding Problem that do not require the use of a small set of capacity scenarios. The advantage of this approach that it better reflects actual capacity profiles, which evolve stochastically in a manner that is only roughly approximated by a small set of scenarios. The disadvantage is that the curse of dimensionality must be overcome. We present methods for doing this, and assess their performance.</br>
