The planning process is generally divided into several phases. After a description of the whole planning process and of its main phases, the Platforming and Train-Unit Assignment phases are considered in more detail.     In the Train Platforming Problem, we are given a set of timetabled trains, and the objective is to find the best assignment of the trains to the platforms (and to the routing paths connecting the arrival/departure tracks to the assigned platforms) in a railway station. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is presented, and a column generation procedure is proposed for the solution of the corresponding continuous relaxation. An effective heuristic algorithm, driven by the continuous relaxation of the ILP formulation, is proposed as well. Computational results on real-world instances are reported.       A train unit consists of a self-contained train with an engine and a set of wagons with passenger seats. The Train-Unit Assignment Problem calls for the definition of the “best?train units to be assigned to a given set of timetabled trips, each with a given number of passenger seats requested. Heuristic algorithms based on the solution of ILP models are presented. Computational results on real-world instances are reported.</br>
