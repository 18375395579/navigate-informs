Title: Orthogonal and Nearly Orthogonal Designs for Computer Experiments<br>Author: Boxin Tang, Professor, Simon Fraser University, boxint@stat.sfu.ca<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We construct a class of designs for computer experiments.   Our designs include Latin hypercubes and two-level fractional   factorials as special cases. The basic construction is simple,   building larger designs based on a small design. If the base design   is orthogonal, the resulting designs are orthogonal. We also present   two generalizations: the first improves the projection properties   of the basic method and the second produces designs with smaller   correlations.
