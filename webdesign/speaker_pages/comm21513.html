Our designs include Latin hypercubes and two-level fractional   factorials as special cases. The basic construction is simple,   building larger designs based on a small design. If the base design   is orthogonal, the resulting designs are orthogonal. We also present   two generalizations: the first improves the projection properties   of the basic method and the second produces designs with smaller   correlations.</br>
