Title: Statistical Modeling Approach to Airline Revenue Management<br>Author: Sheela Siddappa, PhD Candidate, University of Texas at Arlington, 402 South Cooper Street, #202, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, ssheela2001@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Dirk Guenther, Jay Rosenberger, Victoria Chen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A revenue management approach based on a Markov decision process is presented. Our approach consists of: (1) An off-line phase that estimates the value function within a realistic state space and (2) An on-line phase that determines the accept/reject policy. In the off-line phase, deterministic and stochastic linear programming solutions provide upper and lower bounds on the value function, and a statistical model is constructed to estimate the upper and lower bounds over the state space.
