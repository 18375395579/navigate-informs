Title: Network Design with Stochastic Correlated Arc Capacities<br>Author: Avinash Bhardwaj, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, avinash.bhardwaj@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alper Atamturk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of network design with stochastic correlated arc capacities. We study the associated master problem and the separation problems. We derive valid inequalities for the related constraint sets and present a computational study to highlight their effectiveness.
