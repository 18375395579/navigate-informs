<br>Title: Gradient based Methods for Large-scale Statistical Computing</br><br>Author: Zhaosong Lu, Assistant Professor, Simon Fraser University, 250 - 13450 102nd Avenue, Surrey, BC, V3T 0A3, Canada, zhaosong@sfu.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we first discuss two simple gradient methods, namely, Nestero's optimal method and two-point projected gradient method for   a class of smooth and nonsmooth convex optimization problems. We then   discuss their application to sparse covariance selection and    principle component analysis. Finally, we compare their performance based on some randomly generated instances.</br>
