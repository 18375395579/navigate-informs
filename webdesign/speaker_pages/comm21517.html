Title: Solving Chance-constrained Stochastic Programs Via Sampling and Integer Programming<br>Author: Shabbir Ahmed, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, 30332, United States of America, sahmed@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alex Shapiro<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss sampling based approximations of chance constraint optimization problems, wherein we replace the distribution of the underlying uncertain parameters by an empirical distribution corresponding to a Monte Carlo sample. The sampled approximation serves to provide good quality feasible solutions and optimality gap estimates for the true problem. Since the approximate problem is an NP-hard combinatorial problem, we adopt integer programming based methods for its solution.
