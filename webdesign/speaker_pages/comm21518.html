<br>Title: Generalized MIR Cuts</br><br>Author: Jean-Philippe Richard, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907-2023, United States of America, jprichar@ecn.purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Santanu Dey</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present a generalization of the MIR procedure so as to generate cutting planes using multiple rows of a simplex tableau. To this end, we study an extension of the simple MIR set with three unstructured constraints that contains two integer and one continuous variable. Using the facet-defining inequalities of this constraints set, a technique is presented to generate valid cutting planes that consider three rows of a simplex tableau simultaneously.</br>
