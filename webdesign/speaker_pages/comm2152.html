The Branch & Prune (BP) algorithm has been conceived for exploiting the particular combinatorial structure of DMDGPs, and is currently the only algorithm for distance geometry that is able to enumerate all solutions to the problem. The strong point of BP is its pruning phase, which allows us to remove large parts of the search space and to focus the search on its feasible parts. Our most recent efforts are devoted to the development of new pruning devices, to be used during the execution of BP, that are based on information obtained through experiments of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.</br>
