<br>Title: Stochastic Model for Room Pricing With Upgrading and Group Booking</br><br>Author: Yihua Li, Disney, Orlando, FL, United States of America, Yihua.Li@disney.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Wang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In order to determine optimal room pricing to maximize total revenue, one needs to know what is the best resource allocation associated with,  but the optimal resource allocation also depends on which rack price point it works with. Thus room pricing optimization problem becomes a by-level, non-linear optimization problem. Most published Revenue Management models handle Room Pricing in two stages, which leads to sub-optimal.  In this presentation, we will convert this non-linear by-level problem into a Deterministic LP (DLP) model, then we extend our DLP model to a stochastic model (SLP) to counter all uncertainties.</br>
