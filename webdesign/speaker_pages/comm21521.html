Due to the conflicting nature of criteria there is no single solution that would optimize all objectives simultaneously; a set of optimal non-dominated solutions known as Pareto solutions are determined.  ACSOM has been applied to the M-1 Abrams System Enhancement, Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicle and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle.</br>
