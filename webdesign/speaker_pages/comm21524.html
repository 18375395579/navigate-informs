Title: Multi-commodity Stochastic Network Design: Without Conservation-of-flow on the Design Variables<br>Author: Xin Wang, PhD student, Lancaster University Management School, House 172, Graduate College, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA2 0PJ, United Kingdom, x.wang32@lancaster.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Stein Wallace<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a stochastic, time-dependent, capacitated, multi-commodity service network design problem in which periodic, cyclic schedules are built for a number of vehicles. We aim to find and illustrate the underlying structures of solutions based on stochastic demand by studying the optimal solutions to the stochastic network design problem and comparing them with deterministic counterparts, and to provide insight into developing a heuristic for large problems.
