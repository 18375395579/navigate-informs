<br>Title: Transmission Switching for Large Scale Electrical Networks</br><br>Author: Zhu Yang, PhD Student, University of California, Berkeley, 970 ADAMS ST APT A, ALBANY, CA, 94706, United States of America, yangzhu165@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Transmission switching is the problem of optimizing the topology of an electric power network in order to minimize the dispatch cost. The optimal transmission switching problem which formulates the transmission switching as a mixed-integer program, usually takes a long time to solve in practice. We present algorithms in parallel to achieve satisfactory cost reduction as well as reasonable computation time. We apply the algorithms to FERC 13867 bus test case.</br>
