Title: Primal Dual Schema for Capacitated Covering Problems with Lot-Sizing Applications<br>Author: Tim Carnes, PhD Student, Cornell University, 206 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, tac45@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Shmoys<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: LP-rounding algorithms for the min knapsack and one-demand facility location problems were shown in Carr et al. 2000,  which made use of flow-cover inequalities. We strengthen these results by showing primal-dual schema with the same performance guarantee for these problems. Further, we extend this to the single-item lot-sizing problem with linear holding costs. We believe that this is a significant step for more general lot-sizing problems, and perhaps the capacitated facility location problem.
