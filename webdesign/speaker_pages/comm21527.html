Title: Filtering Algorithms for the Sequence Constraint<br>Author: Willem-Jan van Hoeve, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, vanhoeve@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Louis-Martin Rousseau, Ashish Sabharwal, Gilles Pesant<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the sequence constraint, that appears in many applications such as car manufacturing and nurse scheduling. We present several filtering algorithms in the context of constraint programming: One is based on a regular-language representation, while another applies a specific accumulating data structure. The latter algorithm is the first to achieve complete filtering in polynomial time. We also provide experimental results showing their effectiveness.
