Title: Linear Description of Mixing Sets with Two Non Divisible Coefficients<br>Author: Miguel Constantino, Faculdade Ciências Universidade de Lisboa, DEIO, Ed C6, Campo Grande, Lisbon, 1749-016, Portugal, miguel.constantino@fc.ul.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Agostinho Agra<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a mixed-integer set X, defined by linear constraints in which the coefficients of the integer variables are a or b (integer non divisible). We decompose X into a small number of subsets whose convex hull description is trivial. The convex hull of the union of those polyhedra have an higher-dimensional representation as a linear program. By projection onto the space of original variables we characterize all the facet-defining inequalities of P in the space of the original variables.
