A clique is a subset of vertices that induces a complete subgraph. Given an integer r>0, we consider the problem of removing a subset of vertices of minimum cardinality in a weighted undirected graph, such that the weight of any remaining clique is bounded above by r. A linear 0-1 programming formulation, an exact algorithm for solving this problem, and its complexity on unweighted graphs will be presented.
