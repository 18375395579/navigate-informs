<br>Title: Maximum Weighted Clique Network Interdiction via Vertex Deletions</br><br>Author: Foad Mahdavi Pajouh, University of Florida, 1350 N. Poquito Road, Shalimar, FL, 32579, United States of America, mahdavi@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eduardo Pasiliao, Vladimir Boginski</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Cliques are among the earliest concepts used to model cohesive clusters in graphs. A clique is a subset of vertices that induces a complete subgraph. Given an integer r>0, we consider the problem of removing a subset of vertices of minimum cardinality in a weighted undirected graph, such that the weight of any remaining clique is bounded above by r. A linear 0-1 programming formulation, an exact algorithm for solving this problem, and its complexity on unweighted graphs will be presented.</br>
