Title: GAMS Branch-and-Cut & Heuristic Facility<br>Author: Michael Bussieck, GAMS Development Corporation, GAMS Development Corporation, 1217 Potomac Street, NW, Washington,, DC, 20007, United States of America, mbussieck@gams.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: MIP problems can significantly benefit from user supplied routines  that generate cutting planes and good integer feasible solutions.  The  GAMS Branch-and-Cut & Heuristic (BCH) facility introduced in 2004  automates all major steps necessary to define, execute, and control  user defined routines within general purpose MIP codes. Recent  development of BCH resulted in more BCH aware solvers including Cbc  and SCIP. New BCH features include solution filters and support for  banch-and-price.
