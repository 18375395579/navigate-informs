Title: Revenue Optimization Algorithm with Adaptive Learning<br>Author: Soonhui Lee, PhD Candidate, Northwestern university, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, soonhui@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tito Homem-de-Mello, Anton Kleywegt<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss stochastic optimization problems that involve unknown dependencies between control and random variables, where we lack information about both the distribution of uncertainty and the exact form of revenue function. We study adaptive algorithm that provides the decision which converges to the true optimal solution with learning demand and optimizing revenue iteratively.
