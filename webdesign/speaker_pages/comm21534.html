Allowing for unattainable benchmarks, we introduce a shift in the benchmark return, which is penalized in the objective function. This results in a floating benchmark, which can be viewed as a continuum of conditional value at risk constraints with aspiration levels. A new cutting plane method for the resulting problem is proposed. Numerical illustration is provided.</br>
