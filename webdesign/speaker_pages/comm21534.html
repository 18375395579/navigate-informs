Title: Risk Averse Portfolio Optimization Via Stochastic Dominance with Respect to a Floating Benchmark<br>Author: Darinka Dentcheva, Professor, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States of America, darinka.dentcheva@stevens.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrzej Ruszczynski<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider optimal portfolio selection approach which requires the portfolio returns to dominate a random benchmark.  Allowing for unattainable benchmarks, we introduce a shift in the benchmark return, which is penalized in the objective function. This results in a floating benchmark, which can be viewed as a continuum of conditional value at risk constraints with aspiration levels. A new cutting plane method for the resulting problem is proposed. Numerical illustration is provided.
