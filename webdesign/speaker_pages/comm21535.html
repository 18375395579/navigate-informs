Basis pursuit denoise fits the least-squares problem only approximately. A single parameter determines a curve that traces the optimal trade-off between the least-squares fit and the 1-norm of the solution. We show how to derive a root-finding algorithm for finding arbitrary points on the optimal trade-off curve. We give extensions to more general norms, including complex-valued problems.</br>
