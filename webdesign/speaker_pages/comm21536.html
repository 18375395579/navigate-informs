<br>Title: Numerical Solution of the HJB Formulation for Continuous Time Mean Variance Asset Allocation</br><br>Author: Peter Forsyth, Professor, University of Waterloo, Cheriton School of Computer Science, Waterloo, Canada, paforsyt@uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We solve the optimal asset allocation problem using a mean variance approach, by solving an equivalent formulation in terms of solution of a Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) Partial Differential Equation (PDE).  We use a finite difference method with fully implicit timestepping to solve the resulting non-linear HJB PDE.  We include numerical results comparing time inconsistent and time consistent mean variance strategies, as well as mean quadratic variation policies.</br>
