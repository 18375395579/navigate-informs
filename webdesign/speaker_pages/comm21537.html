<br>Title: B-Dynamic: An Efficient Path-based Algorithm for Solving Dynamic User Equilibrium</br><br>Author: Gitakrishnan Ramadurai, PhD Student, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, JEC 4002 Dept of Civil and Environmental, Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, ramadg@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to solve the DUE assignment problem considering simultaneous activity location, time of participation, duration, and route choice decisions. The algorithm obviates path enumeration. The algorithm is an extension of Dial’s “Algorithm B? which solves the static UE problem to the dynamic case.</br>
