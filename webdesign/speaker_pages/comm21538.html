In the AA-based OPF problem, all the state and control variables are treated in affine form to represent forecast, model error, and other sources of uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed AA-based OPF problem is applied to the determination of operational margins of the thermal generators in grids with renewable generation.</br>
