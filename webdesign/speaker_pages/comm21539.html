Yet, incorporating the effects of training into optimization models that explicitly account for the effects of training on human learning complicates an already nonlinear integer program.  We linearize the model via reformulation and develop a solution approach to overcome the significant increase in constraints and integer variables.  Our results demonstrate the value of explicitly modeling training.</br>
