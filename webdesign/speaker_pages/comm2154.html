Title: Solving Linear Optimization Problems with MOSEK<br>Author: Bo Jensen, MOSEK ApS, C/O Symbion Science Park  Fruebjergvej 3, Copenhagen, 2100, Denmark, bo.jensen@mosek.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The software package MOSEK is capable of solving large-scale sparse linear optimization problems using either an interior-point, a primal simplex or a dual simplex algorithm. The aim of this talk is to present the optimizers and the recent advances in their implementation. Moreover, we will present numerical results demonstrating the optimizers performance.
