Title: A PTAS for Chance Constrained Knapsack Problem with Random Sizes<br>Author: Vineet Goyal, Tepper School of Business, CMU, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, vgoyal@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): R. Ravi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a chance constrained knapsack problem where we are given a set of n items, a knapsack size B and a reliability level p. Each item has a deterministic size and a random size that is distributed normally and independent of others. The goal is to find a set of items that maximize the profit while satisfying the knapsack constraint with probability at least p. In this paper, we present a PTAS for this problem using a parametric LP approach and rounding the LP solution.
