In a recent work, Khajavirad and Sahinidis presented algebraic expressions for the convex envelopes of various functional forms that are building blocks of nonconvex optimization problems. We propose a cutting plane generation technique based on supporting hyperplanes of the proposed convex envelopes, and present extensive computational results.</br>
