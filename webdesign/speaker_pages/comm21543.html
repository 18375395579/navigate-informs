Title: Stochastic Multi-stage Resource Allocation Model with Reservation<br>Author: Lijian Chen, Assistant Professor, University of Louisville, Department of Industrial Engineering, Speed School of Engineering, RM312, Louisville, KY, 40292, United States, lijian.chen@louisville.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a resource reservation approach for the stochastic multi-stage resource allocation problem within a fixed time horizon. By reserving and releasing resources by stages, the scenario tree is significantly reduced and the non-convexity is eliminated. As a result, solving the multi-stage stochastic program becomes implementable for business scale problems. In the remaining part of the paper, we present the optimal condition and results.
