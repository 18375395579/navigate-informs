Title: Trust-search Methods for Unconstrained Optimization<br>Author: Philip Gill, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States of America, pgill@ucsd.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recent research on interior methods has re-emphasized  the role of sequential unconstrained optimization for  the solution of very large nonlinear programming  problems.  We focus on the numerical linear algebra  associated with a class of ``trust-search'' methods  that combine the best features of line-search and  trust-region methods for unconstrained optimization.
