Title: Approximation Algorithms for Correlated Knapsacks and Non-martingale Bandits<br>Author: R. Ravi, Carnegie Bosch Professor, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, ravi@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anupam Gupta, Ravishankar Krishnaswamy, Marco Molinaro<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We give constant-factor approximation algorithms for the stochastic  knapsack problem with correlations and cancellations, and also for  some budgeted learning problems where the martingale condition is  not satisfied. We propose new time-indexed LP relaxations; using a decomposition and ``shifting'' approach, we use the LP values and the time ordering information from these strategies to devise a randomized scheduling algorithm.
