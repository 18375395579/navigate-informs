Title: A Column Generation Algorithm for Choice-based Network Revenue Management<br>Author: Gustavo Vulcano, Assistant Professor, New York University, 44 West Fourth St., Suite 8-76, New York, NY, 10012, United States, gvulcano@stern.nyu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the choice-based, deterministic, linear  programming model (CDLP) of Gallego et al.(2004), and the follow-up dynamic programming (DP) decomposition heuristic of van Ryzin and Liu (2004), and focus on the more general version of these models, where customers belong to overlapping segments. We propose a column generation algorithm that leads to high quality results in feasible computational times.
