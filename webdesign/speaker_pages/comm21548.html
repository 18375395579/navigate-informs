Box 969 MS 9155, Livermore, CA, 94551, United States of America, rlchen@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Carr, Ojas Parekh, Cynthia Phillips</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present algorithms for solving the robust multicommodity network design problem. Given point-to-point demands, specified robustness requirements characterized by a budget-constrained disruption set and a capacity for each edge, find the minimum cost capacity expansion satisfying the given demands. In this talk I will describe the underlying problem, the model and the main components of our algorithms. Computational results from the Survivable Network Design Library are reported.</br>
