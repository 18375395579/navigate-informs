Longman Professor of Mathematics, Department of Mathematics, Oberlin College, Oberlin, OH, 44074, United States, bobb@cs.oberlin.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Optimization is concerned with finding the best way to complete a task. Many applications of optimization, such as scheduling, matching and routing, are well-known. In this tutorial, we will showcase novel applications of optimization to the area of fine art: portraits constructed out of complete sets of dominoes (via integer programming), mosaics comprised of abstract geometric tiles (via integer programming and various heuristics), and continuous line drawings (via the ``solution'' of large-scale instances of the traveling salesman problem).</br>
