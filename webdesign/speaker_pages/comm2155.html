Title: Disruption Management in Aircraft Departure Sequencing<br>Author: Ieyasu Sugimoto, University of Graz, Dept. for Statistics and OR, Graz, Austria, ieyasu@sugimoto.at<br>Coauthor(s): Hans Kellerer, Celia Glass<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Because of operational and infrastructural restrictions and fairness among airlines changes within aircraft departure sequences are limited at many airports. One well known concept to cope with this problem is Constrained Position Shifting. To include priorities this concept has been adapted by assigning individual shifting ranges to aircrafts instead of constant ranges. A dynamic programming based algorithm is presented to solve the problem to optimality  and compared with a genetic algorithm.
