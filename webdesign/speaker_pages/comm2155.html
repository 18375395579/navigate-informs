One well known concept to cope with this problem is Constrained Position Shifting. To include priorities this concept has been adapted by assigning individual shifting ranges to aircrafts instead of constant ranges. A dynamic programming based algorithm is presented to solve the problem to optimality  and compared with a genetic algorithm.</br>
