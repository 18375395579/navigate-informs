Lopes</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We describe the Python Optimization Modeling Objects (Pyomo) package. Pyomo is a Python package that provides an optimization modeling capability that is commonly associated with algebraic modeling languages like AMPL and GAMS. Pyomo can be used to define abstract problems, create concrete problem instances, and solve these instances with standard solvers. The Python scripting language provides a clean syntax for defining models while providing the flexibility of a general programming language.</br>
