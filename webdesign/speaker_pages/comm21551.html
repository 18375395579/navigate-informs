Title: Stochastic Programming Based Resource Allocation Models for Nonprofit Foreclosed Housing Acquisition<br>Author: Armagan Bayram, University of Massachusetts, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, MA, United States of America, abayram@som.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Senay Solak<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider strategic resource allocation decisions for nonprofit community organizations that acquire and redevelop foreclosed properties as part of the societal response to foreclosures. We develop different multistage stochastic integer programming models for the problem, and discuss the efficiency of exact and heuristic solution approaches for these models.
