Title: Incentive Compatible Electricity Pricing via Robust Optimization<br>Author: Joel Tay, Operations Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bldg.

The current pricing scheme in the market is a uniform-price auction that does not lead to Incentive Compatibility. We propose an efficient algorithm that implements Incentive Compatibility via robust optimization, and present computational results.
