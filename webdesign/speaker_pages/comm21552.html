<br>Title: Incentive Compatible Electricity Pricing via Robust Optimization</br><br>Author: Joel Tay, Operations Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bldg. E40-149, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, joeltay@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing total welfare for the day-ahead electricity market from the perspective of an Independent System Operator. The current pricing scheme in the market is a uniform-price auction that does not lead to Incentive Compatibility. We propose an efficient algorithm that implements Incentive Compatibility via robust optimization, and present computational results.</br>
