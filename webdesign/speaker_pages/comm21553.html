Title: A Stochastic Trust Region Algorithm for Mixed Logit Type Problems<br>Author: Anton Kleywegt, Associate Professor, ISyE - Georgia Tech, 755 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, anton@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xinchang Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider mixed logit problems involving a high dimensional integral for each observation in the data set. We propose a trust region type algorithm that separately controls the sample size for each observation’s Monte Carlo integral. In addition, the algorithm controls sampling from the data set. We provide sufficient conditions for convergence, and demonstrate the algorithm with numerical results for the estimation of mixed logit discrete choice models, using data from a busy airline market.
