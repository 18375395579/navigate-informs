Title: Robust Single-machine Scheduling Problem with Budgeted Uncertainty in Processing Times of Jobs<br>Author: Bita Tadayon, University of Florida (Industrial and Systems Engineering department), 406 Weil Hall, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, bitanhj@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study 4 alternative optimization criteria in a robust single-machine scheduling problem. Uncertain processing times are modeled by closed intervals such that the ratio between their upper- and lower-bound values is the same for all intervals. Three alternative uncertainty sets are introduced to moderate the worst-case scenario in the problem. We discuss the complexity of the problem with each criterion under each uncertainty set, and provide optimal algorithms for polynomially solvable cases.
