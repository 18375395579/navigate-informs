Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study 4 alternative optimization criteria in a robust single-machine scheduling problem. Uncertain processing times are modeled by closed intervals such that the ratio between their upper- and lower-bound values is the same for all intervals. Three alternative uncertainty sets are introduced to moderate the worst-case scenario in the problem. We discuss the complexity of the problem with each criterion under each uncertainty set, and provide optimal algorithms for polynomially solvable cases.</br>
