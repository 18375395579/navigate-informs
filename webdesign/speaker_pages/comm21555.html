Title: Multilevel and Multistage Integer Programming: Complexity and Algorithms<br>Author: Ted Ralphs, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, ted@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Aykut Bulut, Andrea Lodi, Gerhard Woeginger<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Optimization problems with multiple levels arise in game theoretic settings in which we would like to model the decision processes of players in competition, whereas problems with multiple stages arise when a series of decisions must be made over a given time horizon, such as in stochastic programming with recourse. In this talk, we'll give a broad overview of the complexity of these problems and describe the algorithms that can be used to solve them.
