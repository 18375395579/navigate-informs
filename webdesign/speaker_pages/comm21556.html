One typical issue is to find the community structures. We propose a community structure detection problem which aims to analyze the relationships among data via the network topology. We collect a series of unified definitions for community structures and formulate the community detection into an optimization problem to identify as many communities as possible, and develop a heuristic algorithm for it.</br>
