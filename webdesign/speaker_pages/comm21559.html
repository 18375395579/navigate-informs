When this structure cannot be preserved, a wide  branching strategy, which branches on all available variables and  assigns them value 1, can be used. This strategy uses delayed branching  techniques to limit the search tree width to a manageable size, and is  competitive with the best-known solvers for graph coloring problems.</br>
