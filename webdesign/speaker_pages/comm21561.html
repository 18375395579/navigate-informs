They can be modeled as countably infinite linear programs (CILP's) but there is no general solution method for CILP's. Recently, a simplex-type algorithm for nonstationary MDPs was suggested. We improved this algorithm while still guaranteeing its convergence to an optimal solution, applied it to a production planning problem, and compared it to a planning horizon approach.
