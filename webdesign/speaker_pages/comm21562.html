Title: A Study of Stochastic Capacitated Lot-Sizing Problem<br>Author: Yongpei Guan, Assistant Professor, The University of Oklahoma, 202 West Boyd Street, Room 124, Norman, OK, 73019, United States, Yongpei.Guan-1@ou.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk addresses a single-item stochastic capacitated lot-sizing problem. It can be verified that this problem is easily to be solved for two period case. For multiple period case, we investigate the performance of current developed valid inequalities for general stochastic integer programming for this problem. The final branch-and-cut algorithm shows the effectiveness of our approach.
