Title: Optimal Product Design in a Competitive Market<br>Author: Ching-Shin Shiau, PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Scaife Hall 402 Mechanical Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, 15217, United States of America, cshiau@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeremy Michalek<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose an optimization approach for differentiated new product design, examining market responses of 1) competitor prices, 2) competitor designs, and 3) retail margins. We utilize first-order conditions to efficiently identify Nash and Stackelberg solutions. We find that optimal product design is decoupled from competition and channel structures when consumer preferences are homogeneous (logit), but heterogeneity (mixed logit) couples design and market decisions.
