<br>Title: Pricing under the Nested Attraction Model with a Multi-stage Choice Structure</br><br>Author: Hongmin Li, Arizona State University, W.P. Carey School of Business, Tempe, United States of America, Hongmin.Li@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tim Huh</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a solution approach to the centralized pricing problem of a nested attraction model with a multi-stage nested tree structure. We reduce the problem to an optimization of a single variable and characterize conditions under which the optimal solution can be uniquely determined. In the case for the multi-stage nested logit model, we show the impact of asymmetry in price sensitivity and adjustment index and we derive a closed-form solution when the tree structure is symmetric.</br>
