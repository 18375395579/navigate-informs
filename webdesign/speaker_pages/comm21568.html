Title: Detecting Motifs in Biological Networks<br>Author: Mohsen Bayati, mohsenb@microsoft.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We use Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS) to design the fastest algorithm for generating random graphs with given degree sequences.  These types of algorithms are very useful in detecting motifs (non-random patterns) in genetic networks. Unfortunately, the existing algorithms for this problem have large running times, making them impractical to use for networks with thousands of vertices.
