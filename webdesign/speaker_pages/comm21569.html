Title: An Algorithm for the Bilevel Approach to SVM Problems<br>Author: Greg Moore, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Amons Eaton 301, 110 8th Street, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, mooreg5@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kristin Bennett<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop an efficient algorithm for solving the the SVM problem of T-fold cross validation which incorporates continuous parameter selection. The algorithm uses a cutting plane technique combined with proximity control to find (local) optimal solutions.  The algorithm can handle many parameters and is also scalable and generalizes well.
