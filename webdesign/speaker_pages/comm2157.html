Title: Tabu Search and Benders Decomposition for a Capacitated Closed-loop Logistics Network Design Problem<br>Author: Gopalakrishnan Easwaran, Assistant Professor of Engineering, St. Mary's University, One Camino Santa Maria, MS 8534, San Antonio, TX, 78228, United States of America, geaswaran@stmarytx.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Halit Uster<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a network design problem in a multi-product closed-loop supply chain setting consisting of remanufacturing and finite-capacity manufacturing, distribution and collection facilities that serve a set of retailers. We present tabu search heuristics and a Benders Decomposition approach that incorporates the heuristics along with the use of strong cuts. We present computational results illustrating the efficiency of approaches.
