Title: The Mixing-MIR Set with Divisible Capacities<br>Author: Ismael de Farias, Assistant Professor, SUNY Buffalo, 403 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, defarias@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ming Zhao<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We extend the Mixing-MIR set of Gunluk and Pochet to include divisible capacities. We give all extreme rays of the convex hull P of the resulting set and an algorithm to give all extreme points. We give a polynomial-time separation algorithm for finding a most violated cut valid for the polar of P, thus establishing the tractability of optimization over P. Finally, we show how to extend our results to the case of two non-divisible capacities.
