Title: Traffic Assignment Subjected to Additional User Constraints<br>Author: Deepak Kumar, dkumar@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper studies the traffic assignment problem subjected to additional user constraints.  In this problem, the additional constraints imposed by the users are the deadlines for reaching their respective destinations.  A simple attempt to solve the problem includes using the time constrained shortest path problem as the subproblem under frank wolfe algorithm.  The properties of the problem will be discussed and the preliminary results obtained will be presented.
