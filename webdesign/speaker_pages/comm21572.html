Title: Interior-Point Methods for Nonconvex Nonlinear Programming: Regularization and Warmstarts<br>Author: Hande Benson, Assistant Professor, LeBow College of Business, Drexel University, Academic Building, 2nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, hvb22@drexel.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Shanno<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk, we investigate the use of an exact primal-dual penalty approach within the framework of an interior-point method for nonconvex nonlinear programming.  This approach provides regularization and relaxation, which can aid in solving ill-behaved problems and in warmstarting the algorithm.  We present details of our implementation within the LOQO algorithm and provide extensive encouraging numerical results.
