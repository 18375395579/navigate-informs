Of particular interest to this talk is on the stochastic cases of routing, which consider the risk of route failures. This talk proposes stochastic programming models for routing problems under independent arc failures. We propose methods which study the dual of the stochastic programs when the routes are given, and generate efficient cuts for the original problem to avoid complete enumeration of all outcomes.</br>
