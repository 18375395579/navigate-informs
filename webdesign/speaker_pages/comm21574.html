Title: Air Cargo Network Planning ?An Integrated Model for a Major Carrier<br>Author: Stefan Friederichs, University of Cologne, Pohligstr. 1, Cologne, 50969, Germany, stefan.friederichs@uni-koeln.de<br>Coauthor(s): Simon Schäfer, Ulrich Derigs<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The central issue in the air cargo industry is the generation of optimal flight schedules. We present a novel model and a column-generation based solution procedure developed in course of a feasibility study for a major cargo airline. The model integrates the planning steps flight selection, aircraft rotation and cargo routing by determining the best combination from a list of mandatory and optional flights, assigning the selected flights to aircrafts and identifying optimal cargo flows.
