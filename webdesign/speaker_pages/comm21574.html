We present a novel model and a column-generation based solution procedure developed in course of a feasibility study for a major cargo airline. The model integrates the planning steps flight selection, aircraft rotation and cargo routing by determining the best combination from a list of mandatory and optional flights, assigning the selected flights to aircrafts and identifying optimal cargo flows.</br>
