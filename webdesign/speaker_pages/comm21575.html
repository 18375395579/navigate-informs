<br>Title: An Optimization Model for the Facility Sizing and Location of Thermochemical Biofuel Production</br><br>Author: Guiping Hu, Iowa State University, 3004 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50010, United States of America, gphu@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yihua Li</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper investigates the fast pyrolysis ?upgrading ?refining pathway, with corn stover being the feedstock and gasoline being the end product. Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to optimize the fast pyrolysis and upgrade facility location and capacity to minimize total production cost. The economic feasibility of building a new bio-refinery in Iowa is analyzed with the comparison to the existing bio-refinery in Louisiana.</br>
