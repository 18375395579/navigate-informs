Title: MIQCP: In Between QCP and MILP<br>Author: Christian Bliek, Principal Scientist, ILOG, 1681 HB2 Route des Dolines, Valbonne, 06560, France, bliek@ilog.fr<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A natural approach for solving Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Programs (MIQCP) is to solve a Quadratically Constrained Program (QCP) at each node in the tree.  An alternative is to solve them as MILP using branch and cut. In this talk, we will describe and compare both approaches, which are now implemented in ILOG CPLEX.
