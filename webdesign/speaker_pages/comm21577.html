Title: Models for the Traveling Purchaser Problem with Side Constraints<br>Author: Luis Gouveia, University of Lisbon, DEIO-CIO, Campo Grande, Lisbon, Lx, Portugal, legouveia@fc.ul.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Ana Paias, Stefan Voss<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a dynamic programming approach for a restricted version  of the TPP.  The variation includes constraints imposing a limit on the number   of markets visited as well as number of items bought per market.  Due to the excessive number of states of the DP we propose a   state space relaxation technique combined with subgradient  optimization.  Computational results are presented for instances with up to 100 markets.
