Travis Waller<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The bi-level dynamic network design problem is strongly NP-hard. Solving this problem efficiently is critical in the development of the capacity expansion policies on networks. A Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition based heuristic scheme is proposed to address this issue. Numerical experiments are performed, new solution methodologies are discussed, and insights are presented.
