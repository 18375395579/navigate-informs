Title: Fast and Robust Primal Bound Generation Techniques for the P-median Problem<br>Author: Gino Lim, University of Houston, 4800 Calhoun Rd, E211 Engr. Bldg 2, Houston, TX, 77204, United States, ginolim@uh.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss new solution techniques for the p-median problem with the goal of improving the solution time and solution quality of current methods. The new methods are based upon combining  elements from two currently existing solution techniques. We also compare three different starting point generation techniques for the algorithms and ultimately present a new solution methodology that provides consistently good results when initialized with a particular starting point generation method.
