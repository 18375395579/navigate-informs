Title: Approximation Scheme for Robust Dynamic Pricing with Two Substitutable Products<br>Author: Zhi-Long Chen, Professor, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, ZChen@RHSmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ming Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a dynamic pricing problem with two substitutable products with a number of business rules. We formulate the problem as a max-min problem which maximizes the worst-case total sales revenue over all possible demand realizations in the demand uncertainty spaces subject to constraints induced by the given business rules and the nature of substitution between the two products. We give a DP algorithm and develop a FPTAS which guarantees a proven near optimal solution in a manageable time.
