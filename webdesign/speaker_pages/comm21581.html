Title: Some Developments in Stochastic MPECs<br>Author: Daniel Ralph, Reader in Management Science, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, d.ralph@jbs.cam.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Huifu Xu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study stochastic mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints, SMPECs, where the second stage is a complementarity problem that is parametric in the first stage variables.  Applications appear in energy markets. Our aim is to understand how the regularisation technique in MPECS, studied by Scholtes and others, might be adapted to sample average approximation SMPECs. Our convergence the analysis is a departure in that it makes use of MPEC multipliers. (With Huifu Xu, Southampton, UK)
