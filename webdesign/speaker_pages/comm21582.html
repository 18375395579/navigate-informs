Title: Social Networks and Choice<br>Author: Jeremy Chen, National University of Singapore, 15 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore, 119245, Singapore, jeremy.chen@nus.edu.sg<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: I consider a simple choice model where multiple agents, connected in a recommendation network, make choices from a finite set. I obtain insights on how the network affects decision making, and efficiently computable analytical solutions that are absent from analyses of activation/cascade models. I show that for the brand ambassador selection problem, a natural greedy selection strategy produces solutions within 63% of optimal. I also demonstrate concavity of profit in the pricing setting.
