Title: Distributionally Robust Convex Optimization<br>Author: Wolfram Wiesemann, Imperial College, 180 Queen's Gate, London, SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom, ww@imperial.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Kuhn, Melvyn Sim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) considers stochastic decision problems where the uncertain problem parameters are governed by a probability distribution that is itself subject to uncertainty. In this talk, we propose a unifying framework for modeling and solving DRO problems. We determine sharp conditions under which DRO problems are computationally tractable. We also provide tractable conservative approximations for problems that violate these conditions.
