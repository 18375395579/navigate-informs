<br>Title: Algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer stochastic games of imperfect information</br><br>Author: Sam Ganzfried, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, sganzfri@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: There often exists a large complexity gap between the difficulty of solving two and three-player zero-sum games. For example, two-player zero-sum matrix games can be solved in polynomial time by linear programming while solving three-player zero-sum matrix games is PPAD-complete.  In this talk I will discuss several new algorithms for computing an equilibrium in multiplayer stochastic games of imperfect information and present experimental results on a three-player poker tournament.</br>
