Title: Using Vector Quantization & the P-Median Problem in Radiotherapy<br>Author: Allen Holder, Trinity University Mathematics, One Trinity Place, San Antonio, United States, aholder@trinity.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gino Lim, Josh Reese<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We show that the discrete versions of quantization design and the P-median problem are the same.  We use this connection to heuristically solve a combinatorial problem in radiotherapy design.
