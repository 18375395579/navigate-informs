<br>Title: Cutting Planes in SCIP</br><br>Author: Tobias Achterberg, Zuse Institute Berlin, Takustr. 7, Berlin, 14195, Germany, achterberg@zib.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kati Wolter</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We give an overview of the cutting plane techniques included in the constraint integer programming framework SCIP. Implementational and numerical issues of several cutting plane separation algorithms are discussed. Additionally, we show how cut selection is performed in SCIP. Computational results show the impact of the different types of cutting planes and the cut selection strategy.</br>
