Title: Stochastic Unit Commitment: Scalable Computation and Experimental Results<br>Author: Jean-Paul Watson, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 5800, MS 1326, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1326, United States of America, jwatson@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): David Woodruff, Sarah Ryan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We describe an ARPA-e project addressing stochastic unit commitment. The problem is to optimize day-ahead and intra-day electricity generation taking into account load and renewable uncertainty. We solve the problem using scenario-based decomposition techniques and modest parallel computing resources. Our solver is embedded in a stochastic simulation environment, to validate the model and to quantify cost savings. We describe experimental results for WECC, ISO-NE, and FERC test cases.
