Title: MPI-based Parallel Genetic Algorithms for Radiation Treatment Planning<br>Author: Gino Lim, Associate Professor, University of Houston, Department of Industrial Engineering, E206 Engineering Building 2, Houston, TX, 77204-4008, United States of America, ginolim@uh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Likang Ma<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Beam Angle Optimization (BAO) is a very large-scale MIP problem, which is computationally intractable in a clinical setting. To overcome this difficulty, we present two MPI-based parallel genetic algorithms with a Master-Worker framework. We present the results of our approach that show a clear improvement in solution quality, CPU time, and resource utilization.
