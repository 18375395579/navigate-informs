<br>Title: A Tabu Search Heuristic for an Integrated Production and Distribution System</br><br>Author: Claudio B. Cunha, Associate Professor, University of Sao Paulo, Av. Prof. Almeida Prado, Tr.2, n.83, Escola Politecnica - Cid. Universitaria, Sao Paulo, SP, 05508900, Brazil, cbcunha@usp.br</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrei Znamensky</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by the importance of integrating production and distribution aiming to reduce holding costs and lead times of products across a supply chain, we describe a two-phase tabu search heuristic to solve this problem, which also considers a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) policy. Computational experiments for benchmark instances show that our heuristic is effective, and provides better solutions compared to previously reported results.</br>
