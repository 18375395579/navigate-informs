Title: Parametrized Variational Inequality Approaches to the Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem<br>Author: Paul Tseng, Professor, University of Washington, Department of Mathematics, Box 354350, Seattle, WA, 98195-4350, United States, tseng@math.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Masao Fukushima, Koichi Nabetani<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) problem is a generalization of standard Nash equilibrium problem, in which each player's strategy set may depend on the rivals' strategies.  For problems with shared constraints, we propose parametrized families of variational inequalities (VI) whose solutions include all GNEs.  We study sufficient conditions for a solution of the parametrized VI to be a GNE, and propose price-directed and resource-directed VI approaches to search for all GNES.
