Title: A New Rule to Branch in the Branch and Bound Algorithm Based on Flatness Information<br>Author: Ivan Derpich, Doctor, University of Santiago of Chile, Av Ecuador 3769 Estacion Central, Santiago, Chile, iderpich@usach.cl<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The rule proposed is related to measures of the integer with, as provided by so called “Flatness theorem? Our selection rule uses that knowledge to define branching priorities on the variables. Computational results with simulated integer problems are presented, as well with multi-knapsack problems. These show savings of about 40% in CPU time, as well in nodes generated in the search tree, and compare favorable with reports to the others standard branching rules.
