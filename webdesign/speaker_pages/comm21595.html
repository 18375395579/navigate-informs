Title: Enhancing Computational Techniques for Stochastic Linear Programs<br>Author: Udom Janjarassuk, Student, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Mohler Lab, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, udj2@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Linderoth<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We focus on solving large-scale two-stage stochastic linear programs  with a trust-region enhanced, L-shaped decomposition method.  Techniques for improving the computational efficiency of the  algorithm, including warm-starts and dynamic cut aggregation will be discussed.  Computational results will  be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the various techniques
