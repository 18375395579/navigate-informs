<br>Title: MDD Propagation for Disjunctive Scheduling</br><br>Author: Willem-Jan van Hoeve, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, vanhoeve@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andre Cire</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present new propagation methods for disjunctive scheduling, based on limited-width Multivalued Decision Diagrams (MDDs). We show how our method can be integrated efficiently with existing propagation algorithms. Experimental results indicate that the MDD propagation can outperform state-of-the-art propagators especially when minimizing sequence-dependent setup times, in certain cases by several orders of magnitude.</br>
