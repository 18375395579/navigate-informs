Two relatively new heuristic algorithms, 1) Variable Neighborhood Search and 2) Bee-Colony Optimization are explored in a case study of Interstate 66 in Northern Virginia. Ground truth travel times were obtained using GPS probe vehicles driven during the peak periods.  The performed numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms generate high-quality solutions in reasonable CPU times.</br>
