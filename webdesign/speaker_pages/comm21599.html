We also propose a scheme to derive the maximal set of an inequality, which is defined as the set of variable coefficients whose lifting coefficients are not influenced by the lifting sequence. We then apply this tool to derive the maximal sets of various inequalities for 0-1 MIPs. In particular, we show that our result strengthens known bounds for GUB knapsack polytopes.</br>
