Title: Computing Maximal Sets of Mixed Integer Programs<br>Author: Bo Zeng, Purdue University, Industrial Engineering, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States, bzeng@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk, we introduce a systematic method to derive strong bounds on sequential lifting coefficients. We also propose a scheme to derive the maximal set of an inequality, which is defined as the set of variable coefficients whose lifting coefficients are not influenced by the lifting sequence. We then apply this tool to derive the maximal sets of various inequalities for 0-1 MIPs. In particular, we show that our result strengthens known bounds for GUB knapsack polytopes.
