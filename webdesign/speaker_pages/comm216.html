Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, jap120030@utdallas.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally trading returns that are autocorrelated when transaction costs and other constraints are present.  We develop an efficient suboptimal receding horizon algorithm in which a quadratic program is computed at each rebalancing opportunity.  Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the approach.</br>
