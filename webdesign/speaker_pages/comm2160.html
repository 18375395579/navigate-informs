The algorithm seeks to find the solution most preferred by the decision maker (DM). The fitness of a solution reflects preference information elicited from the DM and is based on a partial order obtained from pairwise preference comparisons of solutions and implied preferences based on preference cones. We describe test results for randomly generated multidimensional knapsack problems.</br>
