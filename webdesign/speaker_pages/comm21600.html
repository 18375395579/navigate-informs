Title: Estimating Investment Requirement for Maintaining and Improving Highway Systems<br>Author: Yafeng Yin, Assistant Professor, University of Florida, 365 Weil Hall, Box 116580, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, yafeng@ce.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Siriphong Lawphongpanich, Yingyan Lou<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper presents an integrated and robust approach for estimating the investment necessary to maintain and/or improve the future levels of service and pavement conditions of facilities in a highway network. The approach assumes that future travel demands and facility conditions are confined to an ellipsoidal uncertainty region. The problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints and solved via a cutting plane algorithm on the Sioux Falls network.
