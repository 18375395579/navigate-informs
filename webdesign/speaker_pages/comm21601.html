Title: Lifted Cover Inequalities for Bounded Nonlinear Purely Integer Programming<br>Author: Ismael de Farias, Assistant Professor, SUNY Buffalo, 403 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, defarias@buffalo.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Any bounded nonlinear purely (as opposed to mixed) integer programming problem (BNPIP) can, in theory, be formulated as a linear integer programming problem (LIP). We present a valid inequality generation procedure that can be used to obtain an initial approximate LIP for BNPIP and to improve the formulation automatically within a branch-and-cut algorithm. The procedure is based on lifting cover inequalities derived from the (possibly nonlinear) knapsack constraints of BNPIP.
