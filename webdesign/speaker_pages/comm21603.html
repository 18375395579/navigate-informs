ASRD is a framework for designing algorithms that are adaptive both in seeking new points and in keeping or discarding already sampled points. We present conditions under which ASRD is convergent almost surely and provide numerical results showing that ASRD is promising, especially for difficult problems with large numbers of local optima.</br>
