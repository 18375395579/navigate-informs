Title: Evaluating Alternative Formulations for Open-pit Mine Block Sequencing<br>Author: Thomas Vossen, University of Colorado at Boulder, 995 Regent Dr, Boulder, CO, United States of America, vossen@colorado.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jose Ramirez<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The objective of open pit mine block sequencing is to determine a feasible extraction schedule from an open pit mine that maximizes profits over a given planning period. We propose and evaluate alternative formulations for this well-known problem that are derived from a non-linear programming formulation, and discuss preprocessing strategies that can significantly reduce the size of the resulting problems. Experimental results show the potential of our approach.
