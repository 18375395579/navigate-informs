Title: Value and Policy Iterations with Information Relaxation to Stochastic Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Nan Chen, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Yu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We use the information relaxation technique to develop a value-and-policy iterative method to solve discrete time dynamic programming problems. Both value and policy converges to the optimal ones within finite steps of iterations.
