<br>Title: Between Terrain and a NP-hard Place: Challenges of Solving Multi-objective Shortest Paths on GIS Data</br><br>Author: F. Antonio Medrano, PhD candidate, UCSB, 1832 Ellison Hall, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, United States of America, medrano@geog.ucsb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Church</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The multi-objective shortest path (MOSP) problem involves solving for a set of pareto-optimal paths between multiple objectives, and is NP-hard for computing all solutions. The literature has tested exact algorithms for MOSP on random and road networks, but very little using GIS-sourced terrain-based data. We discuss the unique properties of GIS networks and problems that emerge when solving MOSP on them, and present improvements to exact methods that address these challenges when run on a GIS.</br>
