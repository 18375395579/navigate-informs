We discuss various decomposition strategies for creating convex hulls. Then, we provide various linear and nonlinear valid inequalities in an explicit form. We discuss separation procedures for deriving other valid inequalities.  Finally, we extend our results to quasi-convex knapsacks and to reverse convex constraints.</br>
