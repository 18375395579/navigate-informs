This is called the persistency problem for a discrete optimization problem under uncertain objective. In this talk, we show that a subclass of this problem can be solved in polynomial time. Our results extends the results of Meilijson and Nadas (JAP 1979) to general integer programs (with more than two values) using marginal distributions or marginal moment information. We discuss applications of the model in discrete choice models and integer knapsack.</br>
