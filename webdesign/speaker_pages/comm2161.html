<br>Title: Cluster Detection using Minimal Internal Distance</br><br>Author: Junjie Cao, City University of Hong Kong, Department of Civil Engineering, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon, Hong Kong - PRC, junjie.mail@student.cityu.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kwok Tsui, Kris Baoqian Pan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Testing the null hypothesis of uniformity against a non-random clustering alternative is an important problem. The scan statistic and density-based clustering methods are commonly used to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose another approach based on the minimal internal distance. In the proposed method, we avoid the scan window shape problem and the detected cluster can be of arbitrary shape. Besides, our method can run automatically and no parameter setting is needed.</br>
