The first phase, which is solved by a tabu search heuristic, deals with the major strategic issues of the problem (paramedics?preferences, ergonomic quality of the schedule, and demand coverage on a coarse time scale). The second phase tackles the more detailed aspects left out initially to improve the first phase schedule and make it implementable using MIP.</br>
