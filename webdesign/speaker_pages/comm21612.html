<br>Title: Parallel Branch and Fix Coordination with Decomposition Schemes</br><br>Author: Gerardo Alfredo Perez Valdez, Postdoc, NTNU, Alfred Getz vei 3, Trondheim, Norway, gerardo.valdes@iot.ntnu.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Adela Pages-Bernaus, Asgeir Tomasgard</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We apply a Branch and Fix Coordination algorithm in a parallel setting to solve large Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programs in the context of energy investment/operation. To handle large instances, we use the decomposition already required by the BFC in an L-shaped method, and Lagrangean decomposition, to solve LPs and  improve the bounding throughout the process. Preliminary results show that a careful selection of the subproblems can perform better when compared to solving the original  SMILPs.</br>
