Our framework applies best to problems that are inapproximable according to the standard worst-case analysis. We circumvent such  negative results by designing guarantees for classes of instances, parameterized according to properties of the optimal solution. We apply our framework to the problem of allocating banner ads when advertisers have combinatorial preferences and require at least a minimum number of impressions.</br>
