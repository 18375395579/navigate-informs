Title: Structural Approximations with Applications to Banner Advertising<br>Author: Hamid Nazerzadeh, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, Palo Alto, CA, United States of America, hamidnz@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Uri Feige, Vahab Mirrokni, Nicole Immorlica<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We introduce a new framework for designing and analyzing algorithms. Our framework applies best to problems that are inapproximable according to the standard worst-case analysis. We circumvent such  negative results by designing guarantees for classes of instances, parameterized according to properties of the optimal solution. We apply our framework to the problem of allocating banner ads when advertisers have combinatorial preferences and require at least a minimum number of impressions.
