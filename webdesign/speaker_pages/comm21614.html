Title: Convex Optimization Methods for Dimension Reduction and Coefficient Estimation<br>Author: Zhaosong Lu, Assistant Professor, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada, zhaosong@sfu.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Ming Yuan, Renato Monteiro<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The penalized least squares estimate  model (PLSEM)  recently proposed by Yuan et al. conducts parameter estimation and factor selection simultaneously and has been shown to enjoy nice properties in both large and finite samples. We explore  Nesterov's first-order methods and interior point methods (IPM) for computing the PLSEM. The performance of these methods is then compared. We show that the best of Nesterov's first-order methods substantially outperforms the IPM implemented in SDPT3.
