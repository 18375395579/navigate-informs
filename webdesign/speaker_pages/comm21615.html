Title: New Formulations and Exact Algorithms for the Capacitated p-Center Problem<br>Author: Hatice Calik, Research Assistant, Bilkent University, Bilkent Universitesi, Endustri Muh., Ankara, 06800, Turkey, calik@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Bahar Kara, Oya Karasan, Barbaros Tansel<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The capacitated p-center problem is an NP-Hard facility location problem that requires locating p facilities on a given network and assigning clients with demands to facilities respecting capacities so that the maximum distance between a client and its facility is minimized. We propose new mathematical formulations and exact algorithms which utilize our formulations. We are able to solve problems with up to 1817 nodes while the largest problem solved in the literature has 402 nodes.
