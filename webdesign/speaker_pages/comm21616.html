<br>Title: Preprocessing Stochastic Integer Programs with Stochastic Decomposition</br><br>Author: Suvrajeet Sen, Professor, University of Southern California, Daniel J. Epstein Department  of ISE, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, S.sen@USC.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yifan Liu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic Decomposition (SD) provides a relatively stable platform for solving stochastic linear programs with both discrete and continuous random variables.  We report the performance of such a preprocessing step for decomposition-based branch-and-cut algorithms such as D2BAC.</br>
