In particular, we study so-called 0-1 bipartite instances of this problem, whose approximability is virtually identical to the approximability of arbitrary instances (Woeginger 2003).  We use random graph models to show various almost all-type results for these instances, including that almost always, all feasible schedules are arbitrarily close to optimal.</br>
