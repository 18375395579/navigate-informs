Title: Basis Enumeration Algorithm for Solving Bilinear Programming Problems<br>Author: Churlzu Lim, Assistant Professor, UNC-Charlotte, 9201 University City Blvd., College of Engineering, Charlotte, NC, 28223, United States, clim2@uncc.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a bilinear programming problem in which two disjoint sets of variables are constrained by respective nonempty polytopes while comprising bilinear terms in the objective function. This problem has a broad applicability from bimatrix games to Markovian decision problems. In this talk, we briefly survey bilinear programming solution methods. Then, we propose a new finitely convergent algorithm that implicitly enumerates bases by sequentially covering a polytope.
