PO Box 7009, Reading, PA, 19610, United States, sadan@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abdullah Konak, Alice Smith, Bryan A. Norman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A mixed-integer programming formulation is presented to find optimal solutions for the block layout problem with unequal departmental areas arranged in flexible bays.  The nonlinear department area constraints are modeled in a continuous plane without using any surrogate constraints.  The formulation is extensively tested on problems from the literature.</br>
