Title: A New Mixed Integer Programming Formulation for Facility Layout Design Using Flexible Bays<br>Author: Sadan Kulturel-Konak, Assistant Professor of MIS, Penn State University - Berks, Tulpehocken Rd. PO Box 7009, Reading, PA, 19610, United States, sadan@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abdullah Konak, Alice Smith, Bryan A. Norman<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A mixed-integer programming formulation is presented to find optimal solutions for the block layout problem with unequal departmental areas arranged in flexible bays.  The nonlinear department area constraints are modeled in a continuous plane without using any surrogate constraints.  The formulation is extensively tested on problems from the literature.
