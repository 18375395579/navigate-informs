The first stage is 0-1 MILP and the second stage is LP.  Each uncertain parameter can independently take its values from a finite set of real numbers with unknown probability distribution.  The algorithm solves the relative robust optimization problem with 1.22 x 10^19 scenarios.  All results illustrate impressive performance of the proposed algorithm.</br>
