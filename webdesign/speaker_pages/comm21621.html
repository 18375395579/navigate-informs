In K-MKP, each item has K types of weights and each knapsack has K types of capacity. We describe very large-scale neighborhood search (VLSN) algorithms to solve K-MKP, including an approach that consists of randomly perturbing the current solution in order to efficiently produce a set of simultaneous non-profitable. Computational results are also presented.</br>
