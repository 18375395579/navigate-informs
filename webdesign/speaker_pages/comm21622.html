Title: A Comprehensive Computational Study of Scaling Techniques for Linear Programming<br>Author: Joe Elble, Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States, elble@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nick Sahinidis<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The scaling of linear programs, while poorly understood, is not devoid of techniques.  Scaling is the most commonly used preconditioning technique in linear programming solvers. This paper presents a review and computational comparison of techniques for obtaining scaling factors for linear systems. Old and very recent scaling techniques are investigated.
