Title: Optimal Simultaneous Dynamic Monitoring and Treatment Control for Chronic Diseases<br>Author: Pooyan Kazemian, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, pooyan@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joshua Stein, Mark Van Oyen, Jonathan Helm, Mariel Lavieri<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Leveraging stochastic control theory, we address the problem of dynamic monitoring and control of chronic diseases. We present how, without loss of optimality in the joint control problem, one can find the optimal control of disease risk factors separately from the optimal timing of tests and the optimal set of tests. The patient-centered model optimizes disease monitoring and controls risk factors to limit disease progression. Glaucoma is discussed as a case study.
