Our objective is to provide a robust schedule such that the total  cost is minimized with the consideration of uncertain extreme  events. A Minimax formulation is formulated and a corresponding  algorithm is developed. Our preliminary study verifies the  effectiveness of our approach. The applications of our model include  production and inventory planning problems.
