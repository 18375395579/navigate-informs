Title: Information Relaxations and Duality in Stochastic Dynamic Programs<br>Author: David Brown, Assistant Professor, Duke University: Fuqua School of Business, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, dbbrown@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peng Sun, James Smith<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe a dual approach to stochastic dynamic programming: we relax the constraint that the chosen policy must be temporally feasible and impose a penalty that punishes violations of temporal feasibility.  We describe the theory underlying this dual approach and demonstrate its use in inventory models and option pricing models.
