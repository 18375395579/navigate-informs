Title: Solving the Unequal Area Facility Layout Problem using Linear Programming Based Genetic Algorithm<br>Author: Sadan Kulturel-Konak, Associate Professor, Pennsylvania State Berks, Tulpehocken Rd. PO Box 7009, Reading, PA, United States of America, sadan@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abdulah Konak<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this study, a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA)/Linear Programming (LP) approach is proposed to solve the FLP on the continuous plane with unequal-area departments.  Once relative department positions are set, actual department locations and shapes are determined by solving an LP problem.  Finally, the output of the LP solution is incorporated into the encoding scheme of the GA.  Numerical results show that the proposed approach is very promising.
