Matching  drivers and riders plays a key role in solving ride-sharing problems. A  system-wide optimal solution aimed at minimizing the external societal  costs may not necessarily optimize the cost-savings of each individual  participant. We develop optimization based algorithms to balance the  system’s benefits and users?satisfaction. We evaluate our methods by  presenting a simulation study based on travel demand data from Atlanta.</br>
