Title: Optimizing Stable Rides for Dynamic Ride-sharing Systems<br>Author: Xing Wang, PhD student, Georgia Tech, 765 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, xwang35@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Niels Agatz, Alan Erera<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Smartphone technology enables dynamic ride-sharing systems. Matching  drivers and riders plays a key role in solving ride-sharing problems. A  system-wide optimal solution aimed at minimizing the external societal  costs may not necessarily optimize the cost-savings of each individual  participant. We develop optimization based algorithms to balance the  system’s benefits and users?satisfaction. We evaluate our methods by  presenting a simulation study based on travel demand data from Atlanta.
