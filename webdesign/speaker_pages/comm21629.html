In particular, for a bilinear set in three variables, we derive a complete (nonlinear) description of the convex hull in the space of original variables. We then provide constructive derivations of these inequalities. Next, we describe how lifting can be used to construct the convex hull of disjunctive sets. We illustrate the applicability of this result by deriving the nonlinear convex hull of simple sets.
