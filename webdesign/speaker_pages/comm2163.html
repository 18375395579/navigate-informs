Title: Solving Multiple-Block Separable Convex Minimization Problems Using Two-Block ADMM<br>Author: Xiangfeng Wang, Ph.D. student, Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, JS, 210093, China, xfwang.nju@gmail.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider solving multiple-block separable convex minimization problems using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Motivated by the fact that the existing convergence theory for ADMM is mostly limited to the two-block case, we analyze in this paper, both theoretically and numerically, a strategy that first transforms a multi-block problem into an equivalent two-block problem.
