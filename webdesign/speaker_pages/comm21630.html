Title: A Stochastic Inventory System with an Emission Constraint<br>Author: David Chen, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, chen2213@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rowan Wang, Saif Benjaafar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic inventory problem with a horizon-based emission constraint. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We provide managerial insights into the effect of the emission constraint under a variety of settings.
