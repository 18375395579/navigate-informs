Title: Branch and Price for the Pollution-routing Problem<br>Author: Tom van Woensel, Full professor, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, Netherlands, T.v.Woensel@tue.nl<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose an exact solution for the PRP based on a branch-and-price algorithm. Considering speed as a decision variable significantly complicates the pricing problem as the dominance test becomes harder. We solve the pricing problem by means of a tailored labeling algorithm. Moreover, we introduce a tailored dominance set. Computational results are presented.
