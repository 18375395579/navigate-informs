Title: A RAMP Approach for the Facility Location Problem<br>Author: Dorabela Gamboa, Polytechnic of Porto, ESTGF, Apt. 205, Felgueiras, 4610-156, Portugal, dgamboa@estgf.ipp.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Cesar Rego<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Dual approaches have proved effective in computing lower bounds and solving a variety of facility location problems (FLP). We examine a dual RAMP algorithm for the uncapacitated FLP and present a computational study on standard and other particularly difficult instances that reveals an extremely good performance.
