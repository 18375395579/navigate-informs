However, simply using a black-box maximum flow solver can often lead to an exorbitant amount of unnecessary computations. In this talk, we discuss how to rapidly solve an online sequence of similar maximum flow problems using efficient reoptimization techniques. We will then extend our work to efficiently solve a robust minimum cut problem.</br>
