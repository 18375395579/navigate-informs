Title: A Stochastic Optimization based Decision Support System for Planning in a Process Industry<br>Author: Goutam Dutta, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Production Quantitive Methods Area, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Gu, 380015, India, goutam@iimahd.ernet.in<br>Coauthor(s): Narain Gupta, Robert Fourer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce a multi-period, multiple scenario optimization based decision support system. The DSS is based on a two stage stochastic linear program with recourse for strategic planning in process industry.  The model maximizes expected contribution subject to material balance, facility capacity, and constraints for non-anticipativity. We describe how the database structure for the stochastic optimization model is different in comparison to the multi-period deterministic model.
