Title: P-median and P-dispersion Problems ?A Bi-criteria Analysis<br>Author: Golbarg Tutunchi, NC State University, Dept. of ISE, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, gkazemi@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fatemeh Sayyady, Yahya Fathi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the p-median problem and the p-dispersion problem in the context of a bi-criteria location problem.  We propose a mathematical programming approach to obtain a collection of non-dominated solutions (efficient front) with respect to these two objectives, and propose a Lagrangean heuristic procedure for solving larger instances of the problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a comprehensive computational experiment.
