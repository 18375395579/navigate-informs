We propose a new cluster-first route-second heuristic in which the polynomial-size clustering problem simultaneously considers the service level requirements and approximate routing costs.  Extensive computational results on real-world data are provided, which show that our heuristic outperforms a pure mixed integer programming formulation and a constraint programming approach.</br>
