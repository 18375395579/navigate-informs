Title: Heuristics for Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programs<br>Author: Kumar Abhishek, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, United States of America, kua3@Lehigh.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Linderoth, Sven Leyffer, Annick Sartenaer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We explore three heuristics for finding feasible points for MINLPs based on the feasibility pump. The first approach alternates between rounding and solving an NLP. The second approach extends the feasibility pump of Bonami et. al., and solves an MILP iteratively instead of rounding. Finally, our third approach integrates the feasibility pump within an LP/NLP-based branch-and-cut framework. We present detailed numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of these heuristics.
