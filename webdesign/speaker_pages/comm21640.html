Title: A New Framework for Combining Global and Local Surrogates in Black-box Optimization<br>Author: Yibo Ji, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore, 119260 SK, Singapore, jiyibo@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Wendy Xu, Myun-Seok Cheon, Sujin Kim<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a new framework for solving computationally expensive optimization problems, where neither their closed-forms nor derivatives are available. We first build a global metamodel to identify the promising area, and then conduct a local search to ensure local optimality. One of the key performance factors is how we balance the two procedures. The framework is designed to accommodate various types of global and local search methods. Numerical studies demonstrate the feasibility of our work.
