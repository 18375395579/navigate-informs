Title: Multi-product Closed-loop Supply Chain Network Design: Models and Solution Approaches<br>Author: Gopalakrishnan Easwaran, Texas A&M University, 303k Zachry Engg Center, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843-3131, United States, gopal@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elif Akcali, Halit Uster, Sila Cetinkaya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a general class of multi-product closed-loop supply chain network design problems motivated by the practice of an original equipment manufacturer in the automotive service parts industry. We present MIP formulations with various realistic considerations, develop efficient solution approaches, and present computational results.
