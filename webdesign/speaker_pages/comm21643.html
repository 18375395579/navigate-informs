Title: Multi-product Markdown Optimization<br>Author: Anahita Hassanzadeh, Doctoral Student, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, anh509@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Vakhutinsky, Kiran Panchamgam, Maxime Cohen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We focus on markdown optimization problem for multiple products with substitutable demands subject to markdown budget and sell-through constraints. We present a mixed integer linear optimization model based on approximation of the underlying demand function and propose a solution approach that runs sufficiently fast for practical applications.  We demonstrate how various business rules are addressed and report the results of our computational experiments.
