Title: Computational Methods for the Dynamic Traffic Information Update Problem under Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications<br>Author: Yong Hoon Kim, Graduate student, Purdue University, 3000 Kent ave., West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, kim523@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study proposes an efficient vehicle-based graph theoretical approach to map the information flow to identify the dynamic traffic information update under V2V communications. The efficacy of the proposed model is demonstrated and compared with a information-based graph theoretical approach and a dynamic programming approach.
