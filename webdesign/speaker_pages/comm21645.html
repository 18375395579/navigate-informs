Title: And the Winner is…StepWise Regression<br>Author: Ronen Meiri, Faculty of Management, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel, ronen-meiri@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jacob Zahavi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We explore three classes of methods for solving the feature selection problem in linear regression ?statistical methods, stochastic search methods and feature extraction methods. Our objective is to find the model that yields the best fit, yet exhibits no overfitting. We have applied these models on three realistic marketing datasets. The results indicate that the leading approach for selecting variables is still the commonly used and widely known stepwise regression method.
