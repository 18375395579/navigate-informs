Title: Vendor Selection Mechanisms<br>Author: Mahesh Nagarajan, Assistant Professor, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, Mahesh.Nagarajan@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We use a math programming model to characterize the optimal mechanism for a set of adverse selection problems. We characterize using duality, conditions under which auction type mechanisms are either optimal or perform well. We also provide conditions under which certain bargaining games dominate auctions. In this process we use inner approximation techniques to approximate the infinte dimesnional linear program, thereby demonstrating strong convergence properties of auction type mechanisms.
