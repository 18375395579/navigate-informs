<br>Title: An Approximation Method to Solve Two-stage Stochastic Program</br><br>Author: Yu An, University of South Florida, 3602 Jefferson Commons Drive Apt302, Tampa Fl 33613, tampa, Fl, 33613, United States of America, yan2@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng, Long Zhao</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Two-stage stochastic program is known computational challenging as a large number of scenarios need to consider. In this research, we consider to approximate stochastic programs, especially  stochastic MIP problems, by solving a series of two-stage robust optimization problems with disjoint  uncertainty sets. Preliminary computational results will be presented to evaluate the performance of this approximation strategy.</br>
