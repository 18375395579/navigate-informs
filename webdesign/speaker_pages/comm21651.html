Sadykov, E. Uchoa, J. Han, P. Pesneau, A. Pessoa<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Cutting plane algorithmic strategies translate into stabilization procedures for column generation. Some techniques independently developed in the literature are in fact dual equivalent of one another. The link between in-out separation and dual price smoothing helps to establish convergence proves and effective smoothing auto-regulating strategies that avoids the need for parameter tuning. We develop dual smoothing and provide bench- mark against existing stabilization techniques.
