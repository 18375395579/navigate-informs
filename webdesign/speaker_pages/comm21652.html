Title: Properties of Phi-Divergence Constrained Ambiguous Stochastic Programs<br>Author: David Love, University of Arizona, Applied Mathematics, 617 N. Santa Rita Ave., Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, dlove@math.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guzin Bayraksan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we investigate the properties of the phi-divergence based ambiguous stochastic programs recently proposed by Ben-Tal et. al.  We examine the value of collecting additional data and the convergence to the associated non-ambiguous stochastic program.  A decomposition-based solution algorithm to solve the resulting model is given.  We apply the method to a water distribution problem in Tucson, Arizona.
