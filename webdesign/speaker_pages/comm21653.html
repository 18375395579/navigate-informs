The algorithm searches along two line segments connecting the analytic center and two extreme points. Cuts related to the violated constraints are added to shift the analytic center until a feasible integer solution is found. The algorithm is tested on a set of problems from MIPLIB. Results showed that our algorithm outperforms the feasibility pump in a number of instances.
