We describe several mixed-integer programming models that seek to minimize the expected number of new infections during an outbreak by strategically removing links. Then, we compare the results of our models with those of an existing optimization model. Finally, we develop an algorithm to solve larger problems and show that it outperforms two well-known link selection heuristics.
