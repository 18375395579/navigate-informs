Title: Random Matchings in Forests with Given Marginals<br>Author: Arash Asadpour, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Building, Room 395, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, asadpour@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amin Saberi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this work, we propose a message passing algorithm to sample matchings in a forest when the marginal probability of every edge is given. We study the properties of final probability distribution made by this method and show that it in fact is a distribution which maximizes the entropy. We show how this method can be used as a crucial part in designing an approximation algorithm for a seemingly irrelevant resource allocation problem.
