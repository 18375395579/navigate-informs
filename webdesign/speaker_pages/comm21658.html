Title: Solving the Large Scale Stochastic Programming with Sampling, Decomposition<br>Author: Lijian Chen, Assistant Professor, University of Louisville, 5241 Craigs Creek Dr, Louisville, KY, 40241, United States of America, lijian.chen@louisville.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We will talk about my experience when conducting numerical experiments on solving the large scale stochastic programming with sampling, decomposition, and Monte-carlo simulations. I found the COIN-OR project is quite powerful to handle some operations, such as matrix operations, which are typically completed by commercial packages. We also present a random number generator for selected distributions.
