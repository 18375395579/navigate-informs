Title: Seeking Useful Alternatives in Multi-objective Search using Evolutionary Algorithms<br>Author: Hana Chmielewski, Graduate student, North Carolina State University, Campus Box 7908, NCSU Campus, Raleigh, NC, 27695-7908, United States of America, hanatchmielewski@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ranji Ranjithan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The benefit of providing diverse solution sets in an optimization problem depends on how alternatives are identified in the decisionmaking process.  Solution space diversity may be calculated amongst all solutions, or just certain solutions or variables.  How alternative solutions compare with respect to modeled and unmodeled objective performance is investigated in a water network design problem.  Two approaches, an evolutionary algorithm and mixed integer linear programming are compared.
