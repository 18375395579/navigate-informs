The inventory is computed using approximate dynamic programming given the uncertain future demands. It is common to approximate the value function using piecewise linear separable functions, but this approach fails to capture inter-product dependence. We propose and analyze a new method for constructing features using problem structure and demonstrate its utility in this domain.</br>
