Title: Demand Shaping by Approximate Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Marek Petrik, Research Staff Member, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Rte 134, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, mpetrik@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Dharmashankar Subramanian<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a method for balancing supply and demand using customer incentives to buy alternative products. The inventory is computed using approximate dynamic programming given the uncertain future demands. It is common to approximate the value function using piecewise linear separable functions, but this approach fails to capture inter-product dependence. We propose and analyze a new method for constructing features using problem structure and demonstrate its utility in this domain.
