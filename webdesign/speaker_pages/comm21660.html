We describe an interface between two open open source software packages, OPT++ and tgp, that allows the use Gaussian processes as surrogates in a trust-region method.  We consider multiple sampling methods to guide surrogate construction at each iteration and examine the effects on computational efficiency of the algorithm for test functions and a mechanical deformation problem.</br>
