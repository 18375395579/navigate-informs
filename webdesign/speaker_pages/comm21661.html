Title: An Implied Binomial Tree Approach to Value Multi-factor Real Options<br>Author: Tianyang Wang, McCombs School of Business, The University of Texas at Austin, IROM Department, McCombs School of Business, UT Austin, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, tianyang.wang@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Dyer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a numerical algorithm for solving a multi-factor real options problem by approximating it with  a single factor implied binomial tree. It provides a simple, computationally efficient and accurate way to price high dimensional real option problems with smooth, arbitrary distributions. For risk managers, it serves as a straight forward method for capital budgeting for projects involving flexibility.
