Title: Pseudo-Boolean Regression<br>Author: Peter L. Hammer, Director and Professor, Rutgers University - RUTCOR, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854-8003, United States, hammer@rutcor.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tibérius Bonates<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Generalizing the LAD (Logical Analysis of Data) approach, an iterative procedure is proposed to construct a sequence of polynomials of binary (0-1) variables, approximating a real-valued target function with prescribed values on a set of binary vectors. Solutions with correlations exceeding 97-98% are efficiently constructed on all benchmark problems considered.
