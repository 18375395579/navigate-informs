Title: The Myth of Micro-Aggregation<br>Author: Rathindra Sarathy, Professor, Oklahoma State University, Spears School of Business, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States, sarathy@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Krish Muralidhar<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Micro-aggregation is often proposed as a simple but effective technique for masking numerical confidential data.  In this presentation, we compare the performance of micro-aggregation with other procedures for masking numerical data.  The results clearly show that, compared to other masking procedures, micro-aggregation generally provides lower data utility and/or higher disclosure risk and must be used with caution.
