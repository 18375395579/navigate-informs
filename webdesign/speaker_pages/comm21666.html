Snyder, Shalinee Kishore</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We model the optimization problem for an Energy Management Controller, which optimizes the power consumption within a facility or set of facilities by scheduling the timing of the operation of some of the devices within the facilities. We introduce an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm for this problem and show that the ADP outperforms an existing dynamic programming algorithm. We then propose several scheduling policies that provide good solutions extremely quickly.</br>
