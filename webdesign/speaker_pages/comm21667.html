Title: Preserving Privacy When Sharing Distributed Transactional Data<br>Author: Jing Hao, University of Texas at Dallas, 2601 N. Floyd Rd., SM 33, Richardson, TX, jhao@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sumit Sarkar, Syam Menon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Preserving privacy when sharing data has become an important issue. For transactional data privacy is typically preserved by hiding sensitive patterns. Often the shared data is distributed and the owner must hide the patterns in consolidated database and within each partition. We present an IP formulation for minimizing data distortion while hiding all patterns. For problems not solvable to optimality, we propose three procedures to decompose the problem into a series of sub-problems.
