Title: High-contrast Imaging via Fast Fourier Optimization<br>Author: Robert Vanderbei, Professor, Princeton University, Operations Research & Financial Engineer, 209 Sherrerd Hall, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, rvdb@princeton.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many interesting and fundamentally practical optimization problems involve constraints on the Fourier transform of a function.  Because the fast Fourier transform is recursive, it is difficult to embed into a linear optimization problem.  However, one can adapt the main idea behind the fast Fourier transform so as to make it encodable as constraints in an optimization problem.   We demonstrate on a real-world problem from the field of high-contrast imaging.
