Title: Branch-and-Cut-and-Price Methods for Logistics Problems with Limited Risk<br>Author: Heesu Hwang, PhD Student, The University of Texas at Arlington, PO Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, hhwang@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: There exist many uncertainties in a logistics system, e.g., unknown demand, unsteady fuel cost, and machine breakdowns. We present set-packing models that limit risk and develop a lagrangian decomposition method as well as a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for medium-sized ship-scheduling problems. We compare the lagrangian decomposition approach with the branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm. Computational results are provided, and extensions are discussed.
