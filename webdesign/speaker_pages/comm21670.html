Title: Benchmark Updates in Integer and Nonlinear Programming<br>Author: Hans Mitttelmann, Professor, Arizona State University, Box 871804, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, MITTELMANN@asu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Areas in numerical optimization that have seen recent progress include sparse optimization, derivative-free optimization, and mixed integer programming. Software in the latter area has reached the most mature state and it is also needed in a wide variety of applications. The talk will give an overview of the state-of-the-art in mixed integer linear and nonlinear programming covering free and some commercial software. Progress in a few other areas such as SDP/SOCP may also be documented.
