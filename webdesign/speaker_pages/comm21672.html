Title: Detect Unobservable Attacks with Phasor Measurement Units<br>Author: Feng Pan, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, United States of America, fpan@lanl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Russell Bent, Annarita Giani, Kameshwar Poolla<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: There’ve been increasing concerns about cyber-attack to power grids, partly due to the reliance on remote sensing. We first discuss unobservable attacks and introduce a bilevel program to model such attacks. Under sparse attacks, we show that enumerating upper-level extreme point is sufficient to get an optimal solution and is more efficient than KKT based approaches. We then introduce a model for placing phasor measurement units to detect unobservable attacks and present our empirical studies.
