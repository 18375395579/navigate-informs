Title: Why is Asymptotics-based Optimization in Queueing so Accurate?<br>Author: Ramandeep Randhawa, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, Ramandeep.Randhawa@marshall.usc.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we prove that the optimality gap of fluid and diffusion approximation methods is much smaller than anticipated. We prove that in many recently studied queueing problems,  the difference between the performance of the prescription derived using approximate methods and that of the optimal solution converges to zero as the system scale grows without bound, that is, the approximate prescription is asymptotically exact.
