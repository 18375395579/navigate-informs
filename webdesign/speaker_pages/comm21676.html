Title: Global Optimization of a Class of Non-convex Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programs with Decomposable Structures<br>Author: Ramkumar Karuppiah, Graduate Student, Department of Chemical Engineering, Doherty Hall, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, rkaruppi@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ignacio Grossmann<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a specialized deterministic branch and cut algorithm for globally optimizing large-scale non-convex Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming models with block-diagonal structures encountered in two-stage problems. Bounds on the global optimum are obtained by solving convex relaxations of these models, which include cuts derived from Lagrangean decomposition of these models.
