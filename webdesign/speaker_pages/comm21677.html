Title: Mixed Integer Simulation Optimization for Oil and Gas Field Development<br>Author: Honggang Wang, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States of America, honggang.w@rutgers.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In petroleum industry, because well costs can be extremely high, it is essential that wells be drilled in productive locations and operated effectively. Such development problems are greatly complicated in that the geology of the subsurface is highly uncertain. We propose retrospective optimization using dynamic simplex interpolation for mixed integer simulation optimization associated with oil development problems.
