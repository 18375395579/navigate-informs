Title: Globally Optimal Solutions for Large Single-Row Facility Layout Problems<br>Author: Miguel Anjos, Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, anjos@stanfordalumni.org<br>Coauthor(s): Anthony Vannelli<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the single-row facility layout problem which asks for a placement of facilities with varying lengths on a straight line so as to minimize the total weighted pairwise distances. We consider semidefinite programming relaxations and prove that for a specific relaxation, a significant number of facet-defining inequalities of the underlying integer polytope implictly hold. Using this relaxation, we obtain the first globally optimal layouts for large instances with up to 30 departments.
