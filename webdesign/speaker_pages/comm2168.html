Title: Consistency of Co-clustering Exchangeable Graph Data<br>Author: David Choi, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, davidch@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Wolfe<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We analyze the problem of partitioning a 0-1 array or bipartite graph into subgroups (also known as co-clustering), under a relatively mild assumption that the data is generated by a general nonparametric process. Our result suggests that the stochastic co-blockmodel and other community detection algorithms may be robust to model misspecification. (arXiv:1212.4093).
