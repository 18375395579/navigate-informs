In many applications, however, it is not clear how to construct an appropriate set.  In this work we consider a nonparametric, data-driven approach to constructing uncertainty sets directly from historical samples of the uncertainty.  Robust optimization problems using these sets remain tractable and enjoy strong probabilistic guarantees.</br>
