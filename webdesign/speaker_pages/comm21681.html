<br>Title: A Pickup and Delivery Problem for Ridesharing Considering Congestion</br><br>Author: Xiaoqing Wang, research assistant, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Avenue, GER 240, LOS ANGELES, CA, 90089, United States of America, xiaoqinw@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maged Dessouky, Sven Koenig, Masabumi Furuhata, Fernando Ordonez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a vehicle pickup and delivery problem with the objective of minimizing the total travel cost and customer ride time while considering the discounted toll rates on high occupancy vehicles and the availability of HOV lanes. A 0-1 integer programming model is formulated to solve the problem optimally. Heuristics are developed to efficiently solve the problem. The Adjust Pickup Time Algorithm and the Waiting Strategy are proposed to reduce the total cost and the customer ride time.</br>
