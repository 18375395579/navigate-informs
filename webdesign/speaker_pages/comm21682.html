Title: Action-graph Games<br>Author: Kevin Leyton-Brown, Assistant Professor, University of British Columbia, 2366 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada, kevinlb@cs.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Navin Bhat, Albert Xin Jiang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Action-Graph Games (AGGs) are a realistic, fully-expressive game representation that can compactly express utility functions with structure such as context-specific (or strict) independence, anonymity, and additivity. We give dynamic programming algorithms for computing sample Nash and correlated equilibria. Experiments with these algorithms show that the AGG representation enables a dramatic increase in the size of games accessible to computational methods.
