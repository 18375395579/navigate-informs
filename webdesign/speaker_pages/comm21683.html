Title: Ordered Rules for Classification<br>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, rudin@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Allison Chang, Dimitris Bertsimas<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We aim to design classifiers that have the interpretability of association rules yet match the predictive power of top machine learning algorithms. We propose a novel mixed integer optimization (MIO) approach for this task. Our algorithm builds decision list classifiers that are both simple and insightful.
