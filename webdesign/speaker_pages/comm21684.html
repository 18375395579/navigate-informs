Title: Two-stage Minimax Regret Robust Uncapacitated Lot-Sizing<br>Author: Muhong Zhang, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, 699 S.

A mixed integer programming formulation is proposed. Even though the robust uncapacitated lot-sizing problem with discrete scenarios is an NP-hard problem, we show that it is polynomial solvable under the interval uncertain demand set.
