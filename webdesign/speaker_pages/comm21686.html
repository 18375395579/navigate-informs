We present a robust optimization method for problems with nonconvex cost functions and problems based on simulations such as PDE solvers and kriging metamodels.  This technique can be employed for most real-world problems.  With an actual engineering problem in nano-photonic design, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the robustness in a high-dimensional design space with a nonconvex objective function.</br>
