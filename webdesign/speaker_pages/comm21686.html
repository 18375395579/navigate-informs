Title: Robust Optimization for Simulation-based Problems<br>Author: Omid Nohadani, MIT, 77 Mass. Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, nohadani@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Most robust optimization techniques assume that underlying cost functions are given explicitly.  We present a robust optimization method for problems with nonconvex cost functions and problems based on simulations such as PDE solvers and kriging metamodels.  This technique can be employed for most real-world problems.  With an actual engineering problem in nano-photonic design, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the robustness in a high-dimensional design space with a nonconvex objective function.
