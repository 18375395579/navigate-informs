Title: O(sqrt(log n)) approximation to SPARSEST CUT in O*(n^2) time<br>Author: Satyen Kale, Postdoctoral Researcher, Microsoft, 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98121, United States of America, satyen.kale@microsoft.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We show how to compute O(sqrt(log n))-approximations to SPARSEST CUT and BALANCED SEPARATOR problems in O*(n^2) time, thus improving upon the recent algorithm of Arora, Rao and Vazirani (2004). Their algorithm uses semidefinite programming and required O(n^{4.5}) time. Our algorithm relies on efficiently finding expander flows in the graph and does not solve semidefinite programs. The existence of expander flows was also established by Arora, Rao, and Vazirani.
