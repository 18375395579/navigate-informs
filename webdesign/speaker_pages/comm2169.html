<br>Title: A Study of Crane Scheduling for Berth Allocation</br><br>Author: Kang-Hung Yang, PhD Student, University of Oklahoma, 114 W. Constitiution St. Apt. G, Norman, OK, 73072, United States of America, kang_yang@ou.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhili Zhou, Yongpei Guan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Berth allocation and crane scheduling are two relevant research topics for container terminal operations. Most past researches focused on either berth allocation or crane scheduling. In this talk, we study incorporating crane scheduling into berth allocation problem. We study a mathematical model for the problem and develop algorithms that include heuristics and exact solution approaches. Experiments show the effectiveness of our approach compared with the one obtained by a commercial software.</br>
