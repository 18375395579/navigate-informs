Most past researches focused on either berth allocation or crane scheduling. In this talk, we study incorporating crane scheduling into berth allocation problem. We study a mathematical model for the problem and develop algorithms that include heuristics and exact solution approaches. Experiments show the effectiveness of our approach compared with the one obtained by a commercial software.
