Title: CVaR Proxies for Minimizing Scenario-based Value-at-Risk<br>Author: Helmut Mausser, Risk Analytics Research, IBM, 185 Spadina Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5T 2C6, Canada, helmut.mausser@ca.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Oleksandr Romanko<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Minimizing VaR based on a set of scenarios is an integer programming problem. Solving to optimality may demand using only a small number of scenarios, which leads to poor out-of-sample performance. A simple alternative is to minimize CVaR for several different quantile levels and then to select the optimized portfolio with the best out-of-sample VaR. We show that this approach is both practical and effective, outperforming integer programming and an existing VaR minimization heuristic.
