Solving to optimality may demand using only a small number of scenarios, which leads to poor out-of-sample performance. A simple alternative is to minimize CVaR for several different quantile levels and then to select the optimized portfolio with the best out-of-sample VaR. We show that this approach is both practical and effective, outperforming integer programming and an existing VaR minimization heuristic.</br>
