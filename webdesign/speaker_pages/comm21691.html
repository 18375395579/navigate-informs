As regenerative energy supply and consumers demand strongly fluctuate, energy storages and power plants are used to compensate the imbalance. We present a mixed-integer nonlinear model where nonlinear efficiencies, start-up costs, and switching processes are considered. A piecewise linear approximation of  the nonlinearities yields a mixed-integer linear program. For its solution a Branch&Cut algorithm is presented.</br>
