Title: On the Critical Node Detection Problem<br>Author: Ashwin Arulselvan, TU Berlin, Strasse Des 17 Juni, Berlin, Germany, arulsel@math.tu-berlin.de<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We are given a graph G(V,E) and integer k. We seek a set of k nodes whose deletion results in maximum fragmentation of the graph. We study several variants of this node deletion problem and present the techniques studied to solve the problem.
