Title: Some New T-space Facets<br>Author: K. Chen, Georgia Tech, School of Mathematics, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, kchen@math.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ellis Johnson, William Cook<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss the infinite group master polyedron and its  connection to the generation of cutting planes for general mixed-integer  programming.  In 2003, Gomory and Johnson gave two different three-slope  T-space facet constructions, both of which shared a slope with the  corresponding Gomory mixed-integer cut.  We give a new three-slope facet  which is independent of the GMIC.  We also give the first four-slope  T-space facet construction.
