Title: Integer Programming Techniques for General Branchwidth<br>Author: Illya Hicks, Associate Professor, Rice University, Computational and Applied Mathematics, 6100 Main St., MS 134, Houston, TX, 77005-1892, United States of America, ivhicks@rice.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elif Ulusal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present an integer programming model to compute optimal branch decomposition of a submodular function over a finite set (general branch decomposition).  General branchwidth, encompasses graphic branchwidth, matroidal branchwidth, and rankwidth.  The presented model is based upon the relationship of the general branchwidth problem with laminar families and the maximum clique problem.  We provide computational results to illustrate the computational efficacy of the approach.
