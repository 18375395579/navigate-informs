General branchwidth, encompasses graphic branchwidth, matroidal branchwidth, and rankwidth.  The presented model is based upon the relationship of the general branchwidth problem with laminar families and the maximum clique problem.  We provide computational results to illustrate the computational efficacy of the approach.</br>
