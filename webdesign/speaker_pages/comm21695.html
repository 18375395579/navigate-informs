Title: Physician Performance Assessment Using a Composite Quality Index<br>Author: Kaibo Liu, Research Assistant, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 765 Ferst Drive, Room 109, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, kbliu@gatech.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a generic approach to develop a single composite index for physician performance assessment by using nonnegative principal component analysis. A new algorithm, named iterative quadratic programming, is developed to solve the numerical issue. In addition, statistical process control technique is implemented to explain physician performance for improvement purposes.
