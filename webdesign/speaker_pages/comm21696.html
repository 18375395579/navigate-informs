Title: ENRE Student Travel Award: Adaptive Convex Enveloping for Multidimensional Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Sheng Yu, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Harvard University, New Research Building, Suite 250, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA, 02115, United States of America, syu@hsph.harvard.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Enrique Campos-Nanez<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Adaptive Convex Enveloping (ACE) is a powerful general purpose method for solving convex stochastic dynamic programs. With its optimization-oriented design, ACE easily handles large numbers of decision variables and constraints with the speed and reliability of convex optimization, and approximates the value function with error controlled everywhere. As a demonstration, we use ACE on electric vehicle battery station management and find the optimal policy for charging massive number of batteries.
