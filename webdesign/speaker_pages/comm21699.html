Title: MIP Lifting Techniques for Nonlinear Programs<br>Author: Mohit Tawarmalani, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, School of Management, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, mtawarma@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Lifting locally valid inequalities to make them globally valid is a successful methodology for obtaining cuts in MILPs. We extend this approach to generate cuts for nonlinear programming problems. We illustrate the approach in two different ways. First, we obtain cuts for mixed integer bilinear sets without adding variables. Partial sequence independence allows generation of exponentially many facet defining inequalities. Second, we obtain nonlinear convex hull of various disjunctive sets.
