Title: Risk Optimization with p-Order Conic Constraints<br>Author: Pavlo Krokhmal, University of Iowa, krokhmal@engineering.uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A class of risk-reward optimization models that reduce to mathematical programming problems with p-order conic constraints is considered. Properties and solution algorithms are discussed, and an illustrative case study of portfolio optimization with p-cone constraints is presented.
