Title: Global Optimization of Algorithms Applied to Short-term Natural Gas Production Planning<br>Author: Paul Barton, Professor, Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, pib@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Benoit Chachuat, Ajay Selot, Mehmet Yunt<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A natural gas production planning problem is formulated as a math program with computer procedures defining the objective and constraint functions, thereby eliminating internal network variables, and is solved within a branch-and-bound framework. McCormick-based convex relaxations, and the corresponding subgradients, of network calculation procedures are evaluated using operator overloading and solved with a bundle method to obtain lower bounds. Upper bounds are obtained from local solutions.
