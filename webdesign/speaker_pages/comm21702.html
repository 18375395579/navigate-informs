<br>Title: A Complimentary Column Generation Approach for a Complete Graph Partitioning Problem</br><br>Author: Salem Al-Yakoob, Assocsiate Prof, Kuwait University, Kuwait, Kuwait, Kuwait, Kuwait, salem@al-yakoob.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We will present two mathematical programming formulations and a complimentary column generation approach for the problem of partitioning a complete weighted graph into complete subgraphs having the same number of vertices with the objective of minimizing the total edge weights of the resulting subgraphs. Computational results will be presented and analyzed using a wide range of test problems.</br>
