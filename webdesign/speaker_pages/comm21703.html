<br>Title: A Multi-core Benchmark Used to Improve Algorithmic Differentiation</br><br>Author: Bradley Bell, Senior Research Scientist/Enginer, University of Washington, IHME, 2301 Fifth Ave., Suite 600, Seattle, WA, 98121, United States of America, bradbell@seanet.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present an application of Newton’s method that finds all the  zeros of a non-linear function in an interval. This is being used  as a benchmark to improve the multi-core performance of the COIN-OR  open source AD software package CppAD. Different threading  systems, and different versions of this software package, are easily  compared for speed of execution. As an example of the use of  this benchmark, we compare the results for three versions of the  software package.</br>
