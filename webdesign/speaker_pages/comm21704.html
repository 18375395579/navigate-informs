Title: A 2-opt Based Heuristic for the Machine Scheduling Problem<br>Author: Mihalis Golias, Rutgers University, 623 Bowser Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, golias@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Maria Boile, Sotiris Theofanis<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this paper we present two 2-opt based heuristic for the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem that guarantees optimality in two defined neighborhoods. A genetic algorithms based heuristic is also proposed to improve the speed of the heuristics. The behavior and efficiency of the heuristics is illustrated using the discrete berth allocation problem.
