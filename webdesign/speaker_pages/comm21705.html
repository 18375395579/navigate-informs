Title: Adaptive and Robust Radiation Therapy in the Presence of Uncertainty Drift<br>Author: Timothy Chan, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto, 5 Kings College Rd, Toronto, ON, Canada, tcychan@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Philip Mar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present an adaptive, multi-stage robust optimization approach to radiation therapy treatment planning for a lung cancer case subject to tumor motion.  It was previously shown that this approach is asymptotically optimal if the uncertain tumor motion distribution stabilizes over the treatment course.  We show computationally that this approach maintains good performance even if the motion distribution does not stabilize but instead exhibits drifts within the probability simplex.
