<br>Title: A Genetic Algorithm for the Robust Resource Leveling Problem</br><br>Author: Hongbo Li, Beihang University; KU Leuven, Xueyuan Road 37, Beijing, 100191, China, hongbo.li@student.kuleuven.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erik Demeulemeester</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the robust resource leveling problem (RRLP) in which the activity durations are stochastic and the objective is to obtain a robust baseline schedule that minimizes the expected positive deviation of both resource utilization and activity starting time. We present a genetic algorithm (GA) for the RRLP. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our GA, we conduct extensive computational experiments on a set of randomly generated test instances and investigate the impact of different factors.</br>
