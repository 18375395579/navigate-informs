Title: Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Routing with Limited Wind Risk<br>Author: Siriwat Visoldilokpun, Ph.D. Student, University of Texas at Arlington, Campus Box 19017, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, svisoldilokpun@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger, Victoria Chen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a branch-and-price-and-cut methodology to solve the UAV routing problem with limited risk incurred by wind. Risk is approximated via a design and analysis of computer experiment and a convex Multi-adaptive regression splines (MARS) model. A column-and-cut generation algorithm is solved that dynamically adds routes and risk cuts within the branch-and-bound tree. We compare the MARS risk model to a traditional quadratic model. Computational results and extensions are provided.
