Title: Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for Future Values of a Stochastic Process<br>Author: Jinwook Lee, RUTCOR, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, jinwook@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andras Prekopa<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Given a stochastic process with known finite dimensional distributions, we construct lower and upper bounds for the probability that future values of the stochastic process run within prescribed limits. For the solution of the problem we use the technique of the univariate and multivariate discrete moment problem. Applications and numerical example will be presented.
