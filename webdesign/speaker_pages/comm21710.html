Title: Computational Global Optimization<br>Coauthor(s): Janos D. Pinter, Leon Lasdon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The objective of global optimization (GO) is to find the best possible solution in highly nonlinear models that possess multiple ?local and global ?optima. In this tutorial we state the general GO model and discuss some of its important special cases. Next, we review (theoretically and computationally) exact and heuristic solution approaches, and discuss software implementations. We also highlight illustrative applications and GO case studies, and point towards present and future challenges.
