Title: A Branch-and-cut Algorithm for Multicommodity Capacitated Fixed-charge Network Design<br>Author: Bernard Gendron, Universit?de Montréal, C.P. 6128, succ. Centre-ville, Montréal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada, bernard@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mervat Chouman, Teodor Gabriel Crainic<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving large-scale instances of the multicommodity capacitated network design problem. The algorithm combines cutting-plane, Lagrangian relaxation and preprocessing techniques, as well as novel branching methods.
