Title: Bayesian Networks for Automatic Optimization Algorithm Selection<br>Author: Patricia Hough, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 969, MS 9159, Livermore, CA, 94551, United States, pdhough@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Victoria Howle<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a two-phase approach to automatically selecting an optimization algorithm to solve a given simulation-based problem.  We first use a Bayesian network to classify an optimization problem based on its canonical description.  We then use probabilistic models of human expert recommendation combined with experimental performance data to choose a suitable algorithm.  Finally, we discuss initial studies on test problems and challenges associated with simulation-based problems.
