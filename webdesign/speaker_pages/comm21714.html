<br>Title: A Hybrid Heuristic for the P-median Problem</br><br>Author: Mauricio G. C. Resende, Lead Member of Technical Staff, AT&T Labs Research, 180 Park Avenue, Room C241, Florham Park, NJ, 07932, United States, mgcr@research.att.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Renato Werneck</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a multistart hybrid heuristic that combines elements of several  traditional metaheuristics to find near-optimal solutions to the P-median  problem.  Empirical results on instances from the literature attest the  robustness of the algorithm, which performs at least as well as other  methods, and often better in terms of both running time and solution  quality. In all cases the solutions obtained by our method were within  0.1 percent of the best known upper bounds.</br>
