Title: Exact Solution Approaches for Generalizations to the Order-Preserving Submatrix Problem<br>Author: Andrew Trapp, Assistant Professor, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, School of Business, 100 Institute Rd., Worcester, MA, 01609, United States of America, atrapp@wpi.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Order Preserving Submatrix (OPSM) problem is an NP-hard data mining problem that, until recently, has eluded exact solution due to its combinatorial nature. Of late, however, there has been some success in solving the OPSM problem exactly using IP-based approaches. Building upon these, we discuss generalizations of the original OPSM problem, such as how to obtain all statistically significant submatrices, and outline solution approaches. Encouraging computational results are provided.
