Of late, however, there has been some success in solving the OPSM problem exactly using IP-based approaches. Building upon these, we discuss generalizations of the original OPSM problem, such as how to obtain all statistically significant submatrices, and outline solution approaches. Encouraging computational results are provided.</br>
