We use a linear approximation of the voltage-current alternating current OPF formulation to find an AC-feasible solution. This method finds solutions faster than and yields total power costs close to the nonlinear benchmark. We also explore incorporating transmission switching into this approach to produce AC feasible transmission switching solutions.</br>
