<br>Title: A MINLP Approach to Finding Non-pinched, Minimum Energy Distillation Designs</br><br>Author: Angelo Lucia, Professor, University of Rhode Island, Dept of Chemical Engineering, Kingston, RI, 02881, United States of America, lucia@egr.uri.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We describe a MINLP strategy for finding non-pinched, minimum energy designs for single distillation columns and multi-unit chemical processes in which the overall strategy iterates between a nonlinear program and an integer program until no further reduction in the stripping line distance can be found.</br>
