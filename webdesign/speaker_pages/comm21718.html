Title: New Features of SDPA (semidefinite programming algorithm)<br>Author: Kazuhide Nakata, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Oh-okayama Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan, knakata@me.titech.ac.jp<br>Coauthor(s): Mituhiro Fukuda, Kazuhiro Kobayashi, Masakazu Kojima, Makoto Yamashita, Katsuki Fujisawa, Maho Nakata<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: SDPA is a software of a primal-dual interior-point method for solving the semidefinite program and its dual.  At present. we implement new version of SDPA in order to solve large scale problems with specific structure or obtain high accuracy solutions.  In this talk, we report new features of it and show numerical results to evaluate its performance.
