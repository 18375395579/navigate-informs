Title: ASTROS : Active-Set Trust-Region Optimization Solvers<br>Author: Mustafa Kilinc, PhD Student, University of Wisconsin-Madison, kilinc@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sven Leyffer, Todd Munson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Filter methods are an alternative to penalty functions for nonlinear optimization methods. A filter accepts a trial point whenever the objective or the constraint violation is improved.    We present a flexible active-set trust-region framework that implements sequential quadratic programming, sequential linear-quadratic programming, and other step-computation techniques. Global convergence can be enforced by a range of methodologies, such as a filter, a non-monotone filter, and  tolerance tube.
