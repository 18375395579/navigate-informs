A filter accepts a trial point whenever the objective or the constraint violation is improved.    We present a flexible active-set trust-region framework that implements sequential quadratic programming, sequential linear-quadratic programming, and other step-computation techniques. Global convergence can be enforced by a range of methodologies, such as a filter, a non-monotone filter, and  tolerance tube.</br>
