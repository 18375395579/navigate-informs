Title: Stochastic Modeling Approaches for Managing Energy Footprints and Cloud Computing Service<br>Author: Siqian Shen, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 2793 IOE, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, siqian@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jue Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a problem in a data center that operates homogeneous servers to provide cloud computing services. The goal is to minimize energy footprints and to maintain desired quality of service (QoS). We formulate stochastic models with various QoS requirements to optimize the trade-off, and propose decomposition and heuristic approaches for solving the models. Numerical results demonstrate noticeable energy savings, and computational efficacy of the proposed approaches.
