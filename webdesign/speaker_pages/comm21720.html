<br>Title: Robust Rankings for American College Football</br><br>Author: Sam Burer, Professor, University of Iowa, S346 Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, United States of America, samuel-burer@uiowa.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a model for calculating robust rankings of college  football teams. Using several seasons of data, we discover that the  top-25 rankings of a well-known computer system are quite sensitive  to (hypothetical) changes in the outcomes of games between very weak  teams. So we propose a robust variant of  the rankings based on computing an optimal solution of a difficult (but  not impossible!) optimization problem. We confirm  empirically that our rankings are considerably more robust.</br>
