Title: Optimal Multileaf Collimator Leaf Sequencing in IMRT Treatment Planning<br>Author: Zeki Caner Taskin, PhD Candidate, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, taskin@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith, Edwin Romeijn, James Dempsey<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a powerful technique for radiotherapy treatment delivery. We discuss the problem of efficiently delivering a given beam intensity profile. In particular, we need to decompose the intensity profile into a set of beam shapes satisfying the consecutive-ones property. We propose an exact algorithm to solve this problem under different efficiency criteria. Our results indicate that several clinical instances can be solved to optimality within a few minutes.
