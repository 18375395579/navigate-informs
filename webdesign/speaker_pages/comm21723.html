Title: Solution Counting Methods for Combinatorial Problems<br>Author: Ashish Sabharwal, Research Associate, Cornell University, Department of Computer Science, 5160 Upson Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853-7501, United States of America, sabhar@cs.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Carla P. Gomes, Lukas Kroc, Bart Selman, Willem-Jan van Hoeve<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Our work in the past few years has led to several effective techniques for counting the number of solutions of hard combinatorial problems. These include local search sampling methods, the use of special XOR constraints and their generalization, ideas from belief propagation and probabilistic inference, and statistical methods. This talk will compare and contrast these approaches, focusing on their relative strengths and limitations.
