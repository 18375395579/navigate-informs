<br>Title: Piecewise Linear Approximation of Bi-level Problems in Transportation</br><br>Author: Ximing Wang, University of Florida, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, X.Wang@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Siriphong Lawphongpanich, Yafeng Yin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This talk proposes a piecewise linear approximation scheme for solving bi-level problems in transportation.  The scheme allows a bi-level problem to be solved approximately as a linear integer program.  The approximate solution can be further refined by adding additional linear pieces and solving the expanded linear integer program starting from a previous solution.</br>
