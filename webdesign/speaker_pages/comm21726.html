<br>Title: Control Policy Optimization for Dynamic Asset Allocation</br><br>Author: Yuichi Takano, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1-W9-77 Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 152-8552, Japan, takano.y.ad@m.titech.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jun-ya Gotoh</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We utilize a nonlinear control policy, which is a function of past asset returns or economic indicators, to construct a portfolio. Although our previous study has built a computational framework for selecting the best control policy from among nonlinear functions, it was difficult to handle a large-scale portfolio optimization problem. Thus in this presentation, we provide an efficient solution for optimization of a nonlinear control policy by using kernel principal component analysis.</br>
