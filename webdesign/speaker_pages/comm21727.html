<br>Title: Optimization Algorithms for Large Scale Web Classification</br><br>Author: S. Sathiya Keerthi, Yahoo! Research, 2821 Mission College Blvd., Santa Clara, CA, 95054, United States, selvarak@yahoo-inc.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Large scale classification problems routinely arise in many web applications; these are usually approached using support vector machine and maximum entropy models. The training of any one of these models involves the solution of an optimization problem involving a large number of variables and a large number of loss terms. This talk will focus on issues associated with these problems and discuss effective schemes for solving them.</br>
