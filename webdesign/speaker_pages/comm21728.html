<br>Title: Practical Issues in the Analysis of the Solution of Multiple Objective Optimization Problems and DM</br><br>Author: Heidi Taboada, Graduate Student, Rutgers University, Department of Industrial Engineering, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854-8018, United States, heidita@eden.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Coit</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Some approaches to solve multiple objective optimization problems, produce a large number of Pareto-optimal solutions, from which the Decision Maker must then be able to choose a promising one. This decision making stage involves several challenging issues. The selection of one solution over the others may be quite a difficult problem. The main goal of the current project is to use data mining techniques to efficiently organize and reduce the size of the Pareto-optimal set.</br>
