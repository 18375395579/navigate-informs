Title: A Second-order Cone Cutting Surface Method: Complexity and Application<br>Author: Mohammad Oskoorouchi, Assistant Professor, California State University San Marcos, College of Business Administration, San Marcos, CA, 92096, United States, moskooro@csusm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John E. Mitchell<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: An analytic center cutting surface algorithm that uses multiple second-order cone cuts is presented. We discuss the complexity results and show that the overall algorithm is fully polynomial. Computational experiences with random problems of moderate to large size are presented. We compare the results with that of SDPT3, SDPLR and SeDuMi and show that our algorithm outperforms the above software packages on fully dense problems.
