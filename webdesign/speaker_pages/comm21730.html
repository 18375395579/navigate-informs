Title: Disjunctive Cuts for Non-convex Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Programs<br>Author: Anureet Saxena, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, anureets@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This talks addresses the problem of generating strong convex relaxations of Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (MIQQP). We use ideas from disjunctive programming, lift-and-project and eigenvalue computations to generate convex quadratic and linear cuts for MIQQP, and discuss computational results on a battery of test-problems from the literature.  Joint work with J. Lee and P. Bonami.
