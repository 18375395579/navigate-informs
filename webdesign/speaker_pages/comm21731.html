Title: Probabilistic Constrained Problems with Compound Distributions<br>Author: Anh Ninh, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, anhninh@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andras Prekopa<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We prove that the compound Poisson distribution is log-concave, under some conditions for the distribution of the terms. Then we formulate and solve probabilistic constrained stochastic programming problems, for both the discrete and continuous distribution cases, regarding the compound random variables. Applications in insurance and finance will be mentioned.
