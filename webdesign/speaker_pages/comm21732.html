Title: Solving the Ordered One-median Problem<br>Author: Zvi Drezner, California State University-Fullerton, zdrezner@fullerton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stefan Nickel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a general approach solution method for the single facility ordered median problem in the plane. All types of weights (non-negative, non-positive, and mixed) are considered. The big triangle small triangle approach is used for the solution. Rigorous and heuristic algorithms are proposed and extensively tested on eight different problems with excellent results.
