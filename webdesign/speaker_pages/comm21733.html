Title: Transfer Pricing to Decentralized Dynamic Programming Agents<br>Author: Dan Adelman, Professor of Operations Management, University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, 5807 S. Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, dan.adelman@chicagobooth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Canan Uckun<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We discuss a new approach to approximating the optimal value function of certain dynamic programs through internal transfer prices charged by a central authority to decentralized agents in a hierarchical structure. We show the structure of optimal prices and study a scalable numerical algorithm for computing them.  We discuss applications in demand response for the electricity smart grid.
