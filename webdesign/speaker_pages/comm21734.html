Title: Improving the Integer L-shaped Method<br>Author: Gustavo Angulo, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, gangulo@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Ahmed, Santanu Dey<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the integer L-shaped method for two-stage stochastic integer programs. To improve the performance of the algorithm, we devise a simple modification that alternates between linear and mixed-integer subproblems, yielding significant time savings. We also present a general framework to generate optimality cuts via a cut-generating problem which considers information from all solutions found so far at any given stage of the method.
