<br>Title: New Algorithmic Framework for Lost Sales Models with Large Lead Times</br><br>Author: David Goldberg, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, dgoldberg9@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Squillante, Dmitriy Katz, Mayank Sharma, Yingdong Lu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Lost sales inventory models are notoriously difficult to optimize due to the curse of dimensionality.  We show that when lead times are large, a simple algorithm performs nearly optimally.  The main insight is that when the lead time is large, no algorithm can ``beat the uncertainty, so even simple policies perform relatively well.  Our main proof technique combines a novel coupling for suprema of random walks with arguments from queueing theory.</br>
