Title: Modeling Nesting in Network Revenue Management<br>Author: Burak Buke, burakbuke@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Utku Yildirim, Ahmet Kuyumcu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The order in which the arrivals occur plays an important role in assessing the revenue generated by nested booking limit controls. The dynamic programming approach models the arrival process explicitly. However, for most real world problems, dynamic programming is computationally intractable. In this work, we propose a multistage stochastic programming model to approximate the dynamic programming model, while modeling the ordering of arrivals explicitly.
