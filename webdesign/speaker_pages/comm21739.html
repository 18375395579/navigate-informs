Title: On Continuous Formulations of Discrete Optimization Problems<br>Author: Sergiy Butenko, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, butenko@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Balabhaskar Balasundaram<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk will present alternative continuous formulations of several optimization problems on graphs. Some of these formulations will be used to derive optimality conditions, heuristics and bounds on the optimal values.
