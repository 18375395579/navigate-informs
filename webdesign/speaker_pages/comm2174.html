<br>Title: ADP For (Very) High Dimensional Resource Allocation</br><br>Author: Vivek Farias, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, vivekf@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dragos Florin Ciocan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Due to the heterogeneous nature of the resource being allocated (impressions), online Ad Display allocation presents a challenge to traditional revenue management approaches. We present a novel ADP inspired clustering technique that allows for real time resource allocation in such problems.   Since this scheme is calibrated through solving a natural, but massive linear program, we also deploy a scheme that can solve effectively arbitrarily large LPs in a decentralized manner.</br>
