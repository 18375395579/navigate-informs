<br>Title: Using Vehicles as Probes in the System-optimum Network Assignment Under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Natalia Ruiz Juri, University of Texas at Austin, Earnest Cockrell Jr. Hall, 6.2, Austin, TX, United States of America, natiruizjuri@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The advances in wireless information technologies facilitate the collection and distribution of real-time data about the state of stochastic networks. This work studies the impacts of such information on the system optimum assignment of wireless-equipped assets. Mathematical formulations are provided for different probe routing strategies and network characteristics. Optimal solution algorithms and efficient heuristics procedures are discussed and compared.</br>
