Title: Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Representations<br>Author: Zheng Wen, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, zhengwen@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Van Roy<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We provide a provably efficient RL algorithm for large-scale RL problems with sparse Q-function representations. Our proposed RL algorithm is both sample efficient and computationally efficient. The main idea of our algorithm is to choose actions based on “optimism in the face of uncertainty?to hit a right balance between efficient exploration and efficient exploitation.
