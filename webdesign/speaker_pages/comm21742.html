Title: Flexible Hub Location Model for Air Transportation Networks<br>Author: Yong Liang, University of California, Berkeley, 1117 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, United States of America, yongliang@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ye Xu, Z. Max Shen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Air transportation networks suffer a lot from disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, power outage, etc. We propose a flexible hub-and-spoke structure, and formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program that minimizes various of costs terms. Benders decomposition algorithm is applied to solve this problem. We present numerical studies to show the performance of the network with flexible hub assignment, and some other insights.
