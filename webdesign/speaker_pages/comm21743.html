Title: The Stop-and-drop Problem for Nonprofit Distribution<br>Author: Christina Scherrer, Assistant Professor, Southern Polytechnic State University, Department of Industrial Engineering Tec, 1100 S.

Suppose donated food is delivered from a central warehouse to multiple sites. Organizations travel to these sites to pick up their food and make deliveries. After making drop-offs, trucks pick up donations at other locations and return to the warehouse. We solve SD using an exact method, a sequential heuristic, and an integrated heuristic approach, and compare computational results.
