In contrast to the linearization-based approach of adding cutting planes to a linear relaxation of the MINLP, we add cuts directly to the continuous nonlinear-relaxation. We describe methods used to derive cuts from special combinatorial structures and nonlinear functions. Results obtained from computational experiments performed using the open source MINOTAUR toolkit are presented.</br>
