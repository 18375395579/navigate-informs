Title: Geographical Interdiction of a Maximum Flow Network<br>Author: Kelly Sullivan, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, 1 University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, kmsullivan@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a network that resides in Euclidean space and a defender whose goal is to maximize flow from a source node to a sink node in the network.  The problem we examine takes the perspective of an attacker, who seeks to minimize the defender's maximum flow by locating attacks in the area surrounding the network.  We develop a solution approach based on solving a sequence of lower-bounding integer programs and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a set of test instances.
