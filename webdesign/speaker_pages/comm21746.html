<br>Title: Advancing Branch-and-bound Techniques for Mixed-integer Multiobjective Programming</br><br>Author: Margaret Wiecek, Professor, Clemson University, Martin Hall O-208, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, wmalgor@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pietro Belotti, Banu Soylu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Properties of the Pareto set for mixed integer linear multiobjective programs (MOPs) are studied.  Branch-and-bound (BB) rules for pure integer MOPs are reviewed and examined against their applicability for mixed integer MOPs. More effective components of a BB algorithm, namely a fathoming procedure and a data structure for Pareto solutions, especially tailored to mixed integer MOPs, are proposed and integrated into a BB algorithm.</br>
