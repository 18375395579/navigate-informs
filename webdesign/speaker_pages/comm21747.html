Title: Meta-heuristics for Strategic and Tactical Facility Location<br>Author: Michael Bucci, Doctoral Candidate, North Carolina State University, CB # 7906, Daniels Hall, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States, mbucci@nc.rr.com<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Kay, Jeffrey Joines, Don Warsing<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop and compare several meta-heuristic methods for solving facility location-allocation problems that include costs related to both strategic and tactical level decisions.  Problem parameters cover inventory and transportation economies of scale, uncertainty in supply and demand, and multiple product classifications.  Various empirical tests are used to measure heuristic performance by comparing solution cost, solution time, and solution complexity.
