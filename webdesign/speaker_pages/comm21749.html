Title: Solving Mixed Integer Polynomial Optimization Problems with MINOTAUR<br>Author: Jeff Linderoth, Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 3270 Mechanical Engineering, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53715, United States of America, linderoth@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Luedtke, Ashutosh Mahajan, Mahdi Namazifar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study methods for building polyhedral relaxations of multilinear  terms that arise in nonconvex mixed integer optimization problems.  We  present computational results for an approach based on grouping the  variables into subsets that cover all multilinear terms in the  problem.  The approach is combined with additional reformulation  techniques and spatial branching in the software framework MINOTAUR to  produce a solver for mixed integer polynomial optimization problems.
