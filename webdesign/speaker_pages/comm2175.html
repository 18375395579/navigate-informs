Title: On the Control of Diffusions via Linear Programming<br>Author: Andrew Ahn, Columbia University, Department of IE&OR, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, United States of America, aja2133@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Haugh<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Han and Van Roy (2011) proposed a linear programming approach for the approximate control of diffusion processes. We extend that approach and apply it to a class of dynamic portfolio optimization problems with no short-sales and no-borrowing constraints. We also use portfolio optimization duality techniques to establish that the LP approach is capable of essentially solving these problems.
