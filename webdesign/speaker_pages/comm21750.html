<br>Title: A Globally Convergent Primal-dual Active-set Framework for Large-scale Convex Quadratic Optimization</br><br>Author: Zheng Han, Ph.D. Candidate, ISE, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, zhh210@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Frank Curtis, Daniel Robinson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a primal-dual active-set framework for large-scale convex  quadratic optimization that can make multiple simultaneous changes in  the active-set estimate and converge from arbitrary initial points.  Each iteration of the framework involves solving a reduced subproblem,  the cost of which can be reduced by incorporating inexactness. Preliminary results illustrate that this method often leads to rapid identification of the optimal active-set even for poorly  conditioned problems.</br>
