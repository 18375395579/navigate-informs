Title: Fast MILP Feasibility Using General Disjunctions<br>Author: John Chinneck, Carleton University, Systems and Computer Engineering, Ottawa, On, K1S 5B6, Canada, chinneck@sce.carleton.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Hanan Mahmoud<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Branch and bound algorithms for MILP branch on a single variable at each node. General linear expressions of multiple variables are not often used because it is difficult to quickly find an effective general disjunction, and the overall algorithm may slow considerably. We show how to (i) trigger a general disjunction only when it is beneficial, and (ii) construct effective general disjunctions very quickly. We show performance improvements against a state of the art commercial MILP solver.
