Title: Integrality in Stochastic Inventory Models<br>Author: Wei Chen, University of Texas-Dallas, Richardson, TX, United States of America, wxc103020@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Milind Dawande, Ganesh Janakiraman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study several finite-horizon, discrete-time, dynamic stochastic inventory control models with integer demands and starting inventory levels. Equivalent linear programs are formulated for the corresponding stochastic dynamic programs, and integrality results are derived based on the total unimodularity of the constraint matrices. A second approach based on multi-dimensional piecewise linearity of the cost-to-go functions to establish integrality is also presented.
