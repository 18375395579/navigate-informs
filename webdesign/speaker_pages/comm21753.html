Title: Fire-Fighting Resource Allocation for Wildfire Containment Using Stochastic Integer Programming<br>Author: Lewis Ntaimo, Professor, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77840-3131, United States, ntaimo@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Won Ju Lee<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Recent catastrophic wildfires have highlighted the need for new models to assist fire managers in containment decision-making under uncertainty. This talk presents a stochastic integer programming approach to the difficult problem of initial attack for fire containment. The problem involves determining the optimal mix of fire-fighting resources to contain a fire under uncertainty in fire growth. Deterministic models assume that fire growth is known and are therefore, inadequate for this problem.
