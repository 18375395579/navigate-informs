This talk presents a stochastic integer programming approach to the difficult problem of initial attack for fire containment. The problem involves determining the optimal mix of fire-fighting resources to contain a fire under uncertainty in fire growth. Deterministic models assume that fire growth is known and are therefore, inadequate for this problem.</br>
