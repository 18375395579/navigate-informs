Title: On the Polyhedral Structure of Two-Level Lot-Sizing Problems Arising in Vendor Managed Inventory<br>Author: Ayse Arslan, PhD Candidate, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, nur.arslan@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard, Yongpei Guan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a family of vendor-managed inventory models. We first present a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm and the corresponding extended formulation. In addition, we perform a polyhedral study of the corresponding set. We obtain several families of facet-dening inequalities which provide the convex hull description for two  periods. We present computational results that show the strength of these inequalities in a branch-and-cut algorithm.
