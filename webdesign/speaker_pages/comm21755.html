We first present a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm and the corresponding extended formulation. In addition, we perform a polyhedral study of the corresponding set. We obtain several families of facet-dening inequalities which provide the convex hull description for two  periods. We present computational results that show the strength of these inequalities in a branch-and-cut algorithm.</br>
