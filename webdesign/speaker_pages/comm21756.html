Title: Local Search Heuristics for Distance Constrained Spanning Tree Problem<br>Author: Luis Gouveia, Faculdade de Ciencias da Universidade de Lisboa, DEIO-CIO, Bloco c/2 - Campo Grande, Lisboa, Portugal, legouveia@fc.ul.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Ana Paias, Dushyant Sharma<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a Dynamic Program formulation for the Hop Constrained Spanning Tree Problem. Using the DP formulation we develop very large-scale neighborhood structures for this problem. We provide computational results comparing the neighborhood structures with the basic edge exchange neighborhood structure and the best known solutions.
