Title: Network Delay Inference from Additive Metrics<br>Author: Shankar Bhamidi, Postdoctoral Researcher, Dept of Mathematics, University of British Columbia, Dept of Mathematics, UBC, Room 121, 1984 Mathematics Road, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, shanky@stat.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ram Rajagopal, Sebastien Roch<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We use computational phylogenetic techniques to solve a central problem in inferential network monitoring. We design a novel algorithm for Multicast-based delay inference, i.e. the problem of reconstructing delay characteristics of a network from end-to-end delay measurements on network paths. Our inference algorithm is based on additive metric techniques used in phylogenetics.
