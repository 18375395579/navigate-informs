Title: Accelerating Cut Generation in D2 and D2-BAC Algorithms for Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programs<br>Author: Suvrajeet Sen, Professor, Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, sen@sie.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yang Yuan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The D2 and D2-BAC algorithms use strong disjunctive cuts in each iteration of the respective algorithms.  However, these cuts can be somewhat time-consuming when the number of outcomes are very large.  We show to speed-up the cut generation process.  This capability is particularly critical for sampled decomposition algorithms for stochastic mixed-integer programs.
