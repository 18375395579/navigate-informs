Title: An Algorithm for Solving Inverse Integer Programs<br>Author: Ted Ralphs, Associate Professor, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, ted@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Aykut Bulut<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: An inverse optimization problem is that of determining the smallest perturbation in a given objective function required to make a given solution optimal. In this talk, we introduce the inverse mixed integer linear programming problem, discuss its complexity, and propose a general algorithm for solving it. The relationship to bilevel programming will also be explored.
