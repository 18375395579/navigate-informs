<br>Title: Transmission and Wind Investment in a Deregulated Electricity Industry</br><br>Author: Lajos Maurovich-Horvat, PhD student, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, l.horvat@ucl.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Trine K. Boomsma, Afzal S. Siddiqui</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present stochastic bilevel programming models to analyse the interaction between transmission expansion and generation investment decisions in a network with uncertain wind profile. In the upper level, the merchant investor decides where to build transmission capacity constrained by the lower-level optimisation problems of producers and transmission capacity allocation. We examine the effect of various grid investment objectives and conjectural variations for the producers' price response.</br>
