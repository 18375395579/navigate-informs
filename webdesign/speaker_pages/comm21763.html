We show that this problem has an Integer Linear Programming formulation. We developed and tested a heuristics based in the ideas of the Minimum Spanning Tree. Our experiments show that the solution provided by this heuristics may be used as a good initial solution when developing an exact algorithm or a search algorithm specially designed for this problem.</br>
