Title: A Heuristics for Radio Station Location for Telecommunications in Rural Areas<br>Author: Jos?Ignacio del Villar, Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, Mexico City, Mexico<br>Coauthor(s): David Fernando Muñoz<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We discuss the problem of finding a minimum cost location of Long-Haul equipment for wireless telecommunications in rural areas. We show that this problem has an Integer Linear Programming formulation. We developed and tested a heuristics based in the ideas of the Minimum Spanning Tree. Our experiments show that the solution provided by this heuristics may be used as a good initial solution when developing an exact algorithm or a search algorithm specially designed for this problem.
