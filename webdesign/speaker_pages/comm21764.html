Title: Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers<br>Author: Ermin Wei, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 32-D640, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, erminwei@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Asuman Ozdaglar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a network of agents that are cooperatively solving a global unconstrained optimization problem, where the objective function is the sum of privately known local objective functions of the agents. Recent literature for solving this problem focused on subgradient based methods. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed optimization algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers  (ADMM) and show that this algorithm converges at the rate O(1/k).
