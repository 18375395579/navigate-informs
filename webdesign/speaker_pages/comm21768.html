Title: Satellite Network Design, Optimization and Management<br>Author: Ioannis Gamvros, Optimization Consultant, ILOG Inc., 1195 West Fremont Ave., Sunnyvale, CA, 94087-3832, igamvros@ilog.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We introduce several network design and planning problems that arise in the context of commercial satellite networks. At the heart of most of these problems we deal with a traffic routing problem over an extended planning horizon. In satellite networks route changes are associated with significant monetary penalties that are usually in the form of discounts (up to 40%) offered by the satellite provider to the customer that is affected. We develop a branch-and-price-and-cut procedure to solve these problems and describe an algorithm for the associated pricing problem.
