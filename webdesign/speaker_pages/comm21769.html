<br>Title: Long- and Short-Term Production Scheduling at LKAB's Kiruna Mine</br><br>Author: Alexandra Newman, Assistant Professor, Colorado School of Mines, Division of Economics and Business, Golden, CO, 80401, United States, anewman@mines.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We describe an optimization model that plans production both at the strategic and at the operational level for a large underground sublevel caving mine. We present optimization-based heuristics to expedite solution time for this large mixed-integer programming model, and supporting numerical results.</br>
