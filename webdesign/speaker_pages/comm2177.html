<br>Title: Solving Blood Mobile Routing Problem of a Blood Center</br><br>Author: Serkan Gunpinar, PhD, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, ENB118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, sgunpina@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Grisselle Centeno</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Every day, a blood center selects a set of locations among a group of potential locations to collect blood so as to minimize the delivery cost and to avoid shortfalls. We develop an integer programming technique to model blood mobile routing problem of a blood center and apply column generation and branch & bound methodologies to solve it. Through extensive numerical experiments computational results will be presented.</br>
