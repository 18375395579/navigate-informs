Title: Computational Study of Multidimensional Superadditive Lifting<br>Author: Bo Zeng, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 E Fowler Ave ENB118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, bzeng@usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Long Zhao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Strong valid inequalities generated by multidimensional superadditive lifting method will be implemented and evaluated.  Examples include precedence-constrained knapsack and flow cover inequalities for 0-1 mixed integer programs.
