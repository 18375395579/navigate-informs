Title: Analysis and Optimization of Renewable Energy Integration for Hybrid Power System Design<br>Author: Brandon Ha, Graduate Student, Southern Methodist University, 3101 Dyer Street, Dallas, TX, 75202, United States of America, dha@mail.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eli Olinick<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Renewable energy is the key to creating a green, sustainable future. In our study, a comprehensive system modeling approach is taken to identify the optimal system configuration of the power system integrated with renewable energy sources. An MIP formulation of the problem is developed to minimize the system life-cycle cost. Two mathematical programming-based heuristics are proposed to solve this problem efficiently.
