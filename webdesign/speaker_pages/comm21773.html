Title: A Simple and Efficient Multi-start Tabu Search Heuristic for the Uncapacitated Hub Location Problem<br>Author: Claudio Cunha, Associate Professor, University of Sao Paulo, Cidade Universitaria ASO, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil, cbcunha@usp.br<br>Coauthor(s): Marcos Silva<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk we describe a a simple and efficient multi-start tabu search heuristic to solve the uncapacitated single allocation hub location problem, a problem that arises in several contexts, including passenger airlines, postal and parcel delivery, and computer and telecommunication networks. Computational experiments using typical benchmark problems show that our approach consistently returns the best results in very short CPU times.
