Title: Financial Hedging of  Operational Risk<br>Author: Mike Ludkovski, Assistant Professor of Mathematics, University of Michigan, East Hall, 530 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, mludkov@umich.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the optimal behavior of a manager that has control over a physical asset/plant, as well as opportunity for imperfect hedging on futures markets. We solve the combined  problem by separating the continuous and impulse controls and passing to a sequence of stochastic control with discretionary stopping  sub-problems. A complete numerical implementation is then given for CARA risk-preferences where we obtain a recursive formula in terms of conditional expectations.
