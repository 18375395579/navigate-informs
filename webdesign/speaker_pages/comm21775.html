The model attempts to promote energy efficiency with the purpose of prolonging network lifetime.We develop efficient parallel heuristics reinforced with exact methods and cut generations. Computational evidence suggests that such framework and algorithm can provide very good solutions with significantly improved solution times compared to exact methods.</br>
