Title: Quantum Global Optimization<br>Author: Liu Yipeng, PhD Candidate, University of Florida, 387 Maguire VLG # 5, Gainesville, FL, 32603, United States of America, ypliu@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gary Koehler<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the problem of finding a global optimal solution to discrete optimization problems using quantum computing methods. We improve over a successful method, BBW, by converting it from a static method to a dynamic one. To make this practical, we modify the BBW algorithm to achieve a dramatic speed-up. Experimental results show the value of this dynamic version.
