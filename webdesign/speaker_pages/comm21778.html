<br>Title: Stepwise Inverse Optimization for IMRT Treatment Plan Optimization</br><br>Author: Daria Terekhov, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S3G8, Canada, dterekho@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Taewoo Lee, Timothy Chan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Following an analogy between regression and inverse optimization, this work introduces a framework for stepwise inverse optimization and demonstrates its usefulness for IMRT optimization. Specifically, given a clinical treatment plan, our framework provides a structured approach to determining the set of objective functions that are most influential for treatment plan optimization and their weights.</br>
