<br>Title: Convex Version of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines for Optimization</br><br>Author: Dachuan Shih, PhD Candidate, University of Texas at Arlington, Dept. of Ind. & Manuf. Sys. Eng., Campus Box 19017, Arlington, TX76019, United States, dshih@uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victoria Chen, Seoung Bum Kim</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Multivariate Adpative Regression Splines (MARS) is a flexible statistical modeling method that has been used in optimization for stochastic dynamic programs, Markov decision problems, and two-stage stochastic programming. Many optimization methods depend on convexity, but a nonconvex MARS approximation is inherently possible.  To ensure MARS convexity: (1) The form of interaction terms is modified.  (2) Coefficients are constrained to guarantee convex functions.</br>
