Title: Intelligent Mechanisms to Escape Local Optima<br>Author: Michele Samorani, PhD Candidate, Leeds School of Business, Bldg #4, UCB 419, Boulder, CO, 80309-0419, United States of America, Michael.Samorani@Colorado.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Manuel Laguna<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Existing mechanisms to escape local optimality, such as randomization, restarting and neighborhood modifications, are not strategically designed to lead the search to promising regions of the solution space.  We propose the application of data mining techniques to discover effective escape directions from a training set of problem instances with known optimal solutions.  Tests on a set of task allocation problems are conducted to assess the merit of our proposal.
