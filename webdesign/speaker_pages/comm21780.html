Title: MW---Master-Worker Middleware for Grids<br>Author: Jeff Linderoth, Assistant Professor, Lehigh University, 200 W. Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, jtl3@Lehigh.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Greg Thain<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: MW is an open-source software package that enables master-worker computations to be carried out on computational grids.  We will give an overview of the MW design, discuss recent software enhancements, and provide success stories in using MW to solve large-scale numerical optimization problems on a computational grid.
