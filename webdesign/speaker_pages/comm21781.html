<br>Title: Submodular Path Inequalities for the Capacitated Fixed-Charge Network Problem</br><br>Author: Birce Tezel, University of California, Berkeley, Sutardja Dai Hall (CITRIS) Room: 450, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, btezel@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alper Atamturk, Simge Küçükyavuz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we derive new valid inequalities for path substructures of the capacitated fixed-charge network problem. These strong valid inequalities are based on the exact characterizations of submodular inequalities and they generalize the well-known flow cover and path inequalities. We present computational results showing the effectiveness of the inequalities when used as cuts in a branch-and-cut framework.</br>
