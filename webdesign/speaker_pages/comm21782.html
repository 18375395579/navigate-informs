<br>Title: Semidefinite Relaxations in Constraint Programming</br><br>Author: Willem-Jan van Hoeve, Cornell University, 4130 Upson Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, vanhoeve@cs.cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Carla Gomes, Lucian Leahu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We first show how semidefinite relaxations can be integrated effectively as search heuristics in constraint programming. Then we investigate the predictive power of semidefinite relaxations when they are used as such. Both issues are illustrated with experimental results.</br>
