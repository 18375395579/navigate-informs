Title: An Algorithm for Two-stage Stochastic Programs with Mixed Integer Recourse<br>Author: Ted Ralphs, Associate Professor, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, ted@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anahita Hassanzadeh, Menal Guzelsoy<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Due to the complex structure of the mixed integer value function, algorithms for two-stage stochastic linear programs with integer recourse have been con?ned to the pure integer case. We propose an algorithm based on (partial) construction of the value function of the second-stage problem. The algorithm is based on characterizing the local minima of the mixed integer recourse value function.
