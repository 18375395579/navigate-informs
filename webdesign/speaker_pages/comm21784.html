<br>Title: A Scenario Decomposition Approach for Solving Optimization Problems with Coherent Risk Measures</br><br>Author: Maciej Rysz, University of Iowa, 751 W. Benton St. Apt 23, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, maciej-rysz@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pavlo Krokhmal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider large-scale portfolio optimization problems involving higher-moment coherent risk measures. An efficient solution algorithm for decomposing non-redundant scenarios by solving a series of relaxation problems containing linear combinations of scenarios is proposed. Numerical case studies demonstrating significant improvements in computation time are presented.</br>
