Title: A Chance-constrained Optimization Approach to Call-center Staffing<br>Author: Itay Gurvich, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, i-gurvich@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tolga Tezcan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of staffing call-centers with multiple customer classes and agent types operating under quality-of-service constraints. We introduce a chance-constrained optimization approach that takes into account the immanent uncertainty of the forecasted arrival rates. The optimization problem that we construct reduces to a simple non-linear program with a relatively small number of constraints. We show that our solution is asymptotically optimal in an appropriate sense.
