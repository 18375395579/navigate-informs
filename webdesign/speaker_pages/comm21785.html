We introduce a chance-constrained optimization approach that takes into account the immanent uncertainty of the forecasted arrival rates. The optimization problem that we construct reduces to a simple non-linear program with a relatively small number of constraints. We show that our solution is asymptotically optimal in an appropriate sense.</br>
