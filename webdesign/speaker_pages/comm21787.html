Title: Simple and Fast Implementation of Exact Optimization Algorithms with SCIL<br>Author: Frank Baumann, University of Cologne, Pohligstr. 1, Cologne, D-50969, Germany, baumann@informatik.uni-koeln.de<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The SCIL software package facilitates and accelerates the implementation of exact algorithms for hard optimization problems.  Based on the Branch and Cut system ABACUS, it allows the specification of both linear and symbolic constraints, thereby combining the advantages of Integer Linear Programming and Constraint Programming.  SCIL has been used successfully to solve problems in areas such as curve reconstruction, protein docking and range assignment in ad-hoc wireless networks, among others.
