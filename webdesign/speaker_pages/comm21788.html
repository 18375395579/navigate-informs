As products in MTO are often unique and customized, the associated learning curve slope and other production parameters cannot be accurately estimated before production starts. In this paper, a dynamic and adaptive solution approach is developed to estimate the effects of learning and production rate in conjunction with optimization. This approach offers a closed-loop solution through dynamic programming. Monthly production data are used to update the joint probability distributions of production parameters via Bayesian methods. Our approach is illustrated using historical data from the U.S. Army’s Black Hawk Helicopter Program. Managerial insights are obtained and discussed.</br>
