<br>Title: Stochastic Dynamic Control for PHEV Charging Stations</br><br>Author: Asama Kulvanitchaiyanunt, The University of Texas at Arlington, 416 Yates Street, Arlington, TX, United States of America, asama.kulvanitchaiyanunt@mavs.uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Piampoom Sarikprueck, Victoria Chen, Jay Rosenberger, Wei-Jen Lee</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: An infinite horizon policy for a continuous-state stochastic dynamic program is proposed to control a system of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging stations. The martingale model of forecast evolution is used to represent uncertainties for wind farm power generation, solar power generation at each charging station, and nodal market price. Due to the large-scale nature of the problem, an approximate dynamic programming based on design and analysis of computer experiments is developed.</br>
