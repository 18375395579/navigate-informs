Title: Robust Solutions to a Harvest Scheduling and Machine Assignment Problem<br>Author: Jorge Vera, Professor, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Campus San Joaquín, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, 02142, Chile, jvera@ing.puc.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Lui Cheng Lim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Harvest planning is an important issue in forest industry because of cost and yield variability. Robust Optimization can handle uncertain data in problems where no detailed probabilistic information is available. We apply this approach to harvest planning with machine allocation and routing decisions. We show the tradeoff between optimality and robustness and use Monte Carlo simulation to assess the feasibility of solutions and the robustness of the decision model.
