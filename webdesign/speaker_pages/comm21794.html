<br>Title: Optimization Models for Electricity Markets Planning with Network Constraints</br><br>Author: Begoña Vitoriano, Professor, Universidad Pontificia Comillas, Alberto Aguilera 23, Madrid, 28015, Spain, BVitoriano@iit.icai.upcomillas.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Julian Barquin, Felix Fernandez-Menendez</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Medium-term planning involves an equilibrium computation. We develop an optimization model taking into account constraints that represent technical constraints and inter-period operation features (water management, start-up and shut-down of thermal units). If network capacity must be considered, several methods can be defined, leading to different equilibria. Three optimization models are presented: market splitting, capacity auctions and a hybrid one. They have been applied to a real-size case.</br>
