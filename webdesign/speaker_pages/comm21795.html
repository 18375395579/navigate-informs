Title: Linear Programming Insights into Solvable Cases of the Quadratic Assignment Problem<br>Author: Lucas Waddell, Clemson University, 101 Sikes Ave, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, lwaddel@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Adams<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The quadratic assignment problem is a well-known, NP-hard discrete optimization program that has been extensively studied for over 50 years.  We examine three recent, readily-solvable special cases and show how they can be explained in terms of the dual region to the continuous relaxation of the level-1 RLT representation.  These explanations allow for simplifications and/or generalizations of the conditions defining the special cases.
