<br>Title: Algorithms for Network Interdiction Under Suboptimal Enemy Behavior</br><br>Author: J. Cole Smith, Associate Professor, University of Florida, ISE Department, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, cole@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Churlzu Lim</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We examine the problem of fortifying networks to defend against enemy attacks. The enemy can destroy any portion of any arc, yielding a two-level program with an integer first-stage and a bilinear second-stage problem. We also discuss and provide algorithms for the case of suboptimal enemy behavior.</br>
