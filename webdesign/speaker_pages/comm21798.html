Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming Methods for Optimal Control of Cardiovascular Risk<br>Author: Jennifer Mason, North Carolina State University, 111 Lampe Drive, Campus Box 7906, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, jemason2@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton, Nilay Shah, Steven Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We describe ADP methods to approximate the solution to a finite horizon, non-stationary MDP with a continuous state space defined by risk factors including blood pressure and cholesterol. We compare the performance of policies generated from three ADP methods: state aggregation, basis function approximation of the value function, and a new adaptive state aggregation approach. We present numerical results for the optimal control of blood pressure and cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes.
