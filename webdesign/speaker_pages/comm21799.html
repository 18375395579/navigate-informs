Title: A Simulation-optimization Approach for Wildfire Extended Attack Response Planning<br>Author: Lewis Ntaimo, Associate Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering Dept, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, ntaimo@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michelle Alvarado<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a simulation-optimization methodology for wildfire  extended attack planning, which involves dispatching firefighting resources to suppress escaped wildfires.  We formulate the problem as a multi-period two-stage stochastic integer program to determine the location and strategies of firefighting resources over a rolling horizon. A fire behavior and suppression simulation generates scenarios at each period to provide information on fire spread under uncertain weather conditions.
