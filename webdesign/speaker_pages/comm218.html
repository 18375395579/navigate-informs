Hooker<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk we discuss a novel branch and bound algorithm based on approximate Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). We discuss how approximate BDDs can be used to generate upper and lower bounds for combinatorial optimization problems in the form of relaxation and restriction BDDs. We apply the ideas to the well-studied Maximum Independent Set Problem. Experiments show that the proposed branch and bound algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art integer programming technology on this problem domain.
