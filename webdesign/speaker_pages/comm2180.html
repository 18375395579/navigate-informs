Title: On Connections Between Network Coding and Stochastic Network Theory - An Introduction<br>Author: Bruce Hajek, b-hajek@uiuc.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Randomly generated coded information blocks form the basis of novel coding techniques used in communication networks.  The most studied case involves linear coding, in which coded blocks are generated as linear combinations of data blocks, with randomly chosen coefficients. Digital fountain codes, including Luby's LT codes, and Shokrollahi's Raptor codes, involve coding at the source, while network coding involves coding within the network. Recently Maneva and Shokrollahi found a connection between the analysis of digital fountain codes, and fluid and diffusion limit methods, such as in the work of Darling and Norris. A simplified description of the connection is presented,  including fluid and diffusion approximations, with implications for code design.
