This problem is important for Lot Sizing and Rectilinear Partitioning, and is a celebrated application of Topological methods, which we turn into an algorithm.  Finally, we construct asymptotically tight integrality gap lower bounds for both   Rectangle Stabbing and the dual problem of Scheduling Split Intervals, proving that the current approximation ratios cannot be improved by LP-based approaches.</br>
