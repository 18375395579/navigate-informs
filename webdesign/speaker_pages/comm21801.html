Title: A Knowledge Gradient Policy for Sequential Bayesian Ranking and Selection<br>Author: Warren Powell, Professor, Princeton University, Engineering Quadrangle, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, powell@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Savas Dayanik, Peter Frazier<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a new sequential Bayesian ranking and selection procedure, the knowledge-gradient policy, for determining the best of a discrete set of noisy options subject to a constraint on the number of samples taken.  The Bayesian prior is assumed to have a normal distribution with independent components.  The knowledge-gradient policy is provably optimal in several cases, has bounded sub-optimality in general, and compares well experimentally with other information-collection algorithms.
