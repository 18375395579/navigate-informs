Title: Rearrange-While-Working for Perpetually Organized Unit-Load Warehouses<br>Author: Hector Carlo, University of Puerto Rico, Dept of Industrial Engineering, PO Box 9043, Mayaguez, 00681, Puerto Rico, hector.carlo@upr.edu<br>Coauthor(s): German Giraldo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study presents Rearrange-While-Working (RWW) as a strategy to optimize the process of rearranging a warehouse while serving a list of move requests. Due to the complexity of the problem, several heuristics are proposed. Experimental results indicate that the proposed heuristics perform satisfactorily in terms of solution quality and computational time.
