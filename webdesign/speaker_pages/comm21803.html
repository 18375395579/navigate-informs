<br>Title: Prioritized Interdiction Strategies in Nuclear Smuggling Networks</br><br>Author: Dennis Michalopolous, Ph.D Candidate, University of Texas at Austin, Operations Research & Industrial Eng., Austin, TX, United States, dennis_m@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Morton, J. Wesley Barnes</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A prioritized two-stage stochastic nuclear smuggling network interdiction problem is solved using CPLEX and a CPLEX/Tabu Search hybrid approach. We present computational results for both bipartite and general networks. The second problem type makes no assumptions about the network topology and is, in general, a computationally more challenging problem.</br>
