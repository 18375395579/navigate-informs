Title: An Efficient Solution Approach for the Bottleneck Model with General Heterogeneity<br>Author: Yu Nie, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60608, United States of America, y-nie@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yang Liu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a semi-analytical approach that transforms the dynamic equilibrium problem of a bottleneck with heterogeneous users into a static and asymmetric traffic assignment problem, which is subsequently formulated as a variational inequality problem (VIP) and solved by a gradient projection algorithm.  The uniqueness of the solution for the linear VIP with equality constraints is discussed.
