Title: Uncertainty in Process Scheduling Using Parametric Programming<br>Author: Marianthi Ierapetritou, Associate Professor, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, marianth@soemail.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zukui Li<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The consideration of uncertainty in process scheduling is of great importance to preserve plant feasibility during operations. We have recently proposed an approach to deal with demand uncertainty based on the ideas of parametric mixed-integer linear programming. In this work we are extended this work to address (a) The issue of infeasibility prior to the implementation of parametric MILP algorithm, and (b) The consideration of uncertainty in prices and processing times.
