<br>Title: Algorithms for the Train Platforming Problem (TPP)</br><br>Author: Laura Galli, PhD Student, DEIS - Universit?degli Studi di Bologna, Viale Risorgimento 2, Bologna, 40136, Italy, lgalli@deis.unibo.it</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alberto Caprara, Michele Monaci, Paolo Toth</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present an ILP model and an exact algorithm for a specific type of TPP arising in real life applications. The goal is to assign each train a platform and two paths, avoiding platform-conflicts, keeping the number of path-conflicts under a given threshold and maximizing the assignment quality. The formulation has a large number of variables and constraints, thus we use a Branch-and-Price approach and a separation procedure requiring the solution of a specialized Maximum Weight Clique Problem.</br>
