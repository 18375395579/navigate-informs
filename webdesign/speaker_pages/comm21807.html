Title: Optimal Reroute Strategy under Weather Uncertainty<br>Author: Yoonjin Yoon, UC Berkeley, 107D McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, yoonjin@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Under adverse weather conditions on the schedule route such as storm activity, reduction in sector capacity is inevitable. In this research, we set up a geometric model to find an optimal reroute strategy assuming sectors in the storm regions have no capacity. We find an optimal take-off angle by solving a non-linear stochastic optimization, given probabilistic weather forecast. Analytic solutions are presented to understand correlations and sensitivity of relevant parameters and solution.
