Title: Box-Constrained Least-Squares and Nonlinear Optimization<br>Author: Michael Friedlander, Assistant Professor, University of British Columbia, Department of Computer Science, Vancouver, BC, Canada, mpf@cs.ubc.ca<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Box-constrained least-squares problems in their own right represent a rich class of applications.  They also arise as subproblems in algorithms for optimization. We describe BCLS, a software package specially designed for the solution of such problems.
