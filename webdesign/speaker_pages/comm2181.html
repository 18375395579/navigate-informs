Title: Branch-and-Cut for Piecewise Linear Optimization<br>Author: Ismael de Farias, Assistant Professor, SUNY Buffalo, 403 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, defarias@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hongxia Zhao, Justin Yates, Ming Zhao<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Any nonlinear optimization problem can be formulated approximately as a piecewise linear optimization problem (PLOP). We will discuss representability, modeling, and cutting planes for continuous and discontinuous PLOP and a branch-and-cut algorithm for them.
