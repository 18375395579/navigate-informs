Title: The Use of Vertex-packing Algorithms in a Clock-auction Framework for the FCC Incentive Auction<br>Author: Karla Hoffman, Professor, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, United States of America, khoffman@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anthony Coudert, Rudy Sultana<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The FCC proposes to incentivize incumbent TV stations owners to vacate spectrum voluntarily. A proposed clock auction allows broadcasters to choose to stay in their current spectrum band, go off the air, move from UHF to VHF, or co-share an existing channel. This auction design requires that one solve hundreds of vertex-packing problems each round. We provide a short description of the auction design and give details of the testing of alternative algorithms to solve the vertex packing problem.
