Art Chaovalitwongse, Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Rd, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, wchaoval@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Meeyoung Cha, Sue Moon, Zhe Liang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a novel optimization model for always-on streaming services, which involve multilayer networks. The objective of provisioning always-on services is to minimize the communication cost subject to security and reliability constraints, in the case of operational failures and catastrophic events. IPTV multicasting is a case study in this talk. We propose two new solution approaches: multi-objective greedy search algorithm and column generation framework with branch-and-price procedure.</br>
