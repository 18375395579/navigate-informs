Title: MOSEK ApS - On Using MOSEK to Solve Large-Scale Linear and Conic Optimization Problems<br>Author: Erling Andersen, CEO, MOSEK ApS, Fruebjergvej 3, Box 16, DK-2100, Copenhagen, Denmark, e.d.andersen@mosek.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: MOSEK is a tool for solving large scale potentially mixed-integer linear and conic optimization problems. In this demonstration we will introduce MOSEK and demonstrate how to call MOSEK from mainstream languages such as C, MATLAB, Java, .NET and Python.
