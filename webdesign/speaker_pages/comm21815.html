Title: On the Relationship between Risk Preferences and Uncertainty Sets in Robust Optimization<br>Author: Dessislava Pachamanova, Associate Professor, Babson College, Babson Park, MA, United States of America, dpachamanova@babson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Melvyn Sim, Karthik Natarajan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We illustrate the correspondence between uncertainty sets in robust optimization and some popular risk measures in finance and show how robust optimization can be used to generalize the concepts of these risk measures. We show that by using properly defined uncertainty sets in robust optimization models, one can construct coherent risk measures and address the issue of the computational tractability of the resulting formulations. We also review extensions and recent related work in this area.
