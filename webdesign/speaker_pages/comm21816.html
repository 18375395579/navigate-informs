The problem is further complicated by weakly infeasible conic models. We present a new set of stopping criteria for interior point conic optimization methods with self-dual embedding. The technique preserves the polynomial complexity of the interior point method and it can be further enhanced by preprocessing. The method is illustrated with the SeDuMi package.</br>
