Title: Infeasibility Detection in SeDuMi<br>Author: Imre Pólik, PhD Student, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street W., Department of Mathematics, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4K1, Canada, poliki@mcmaster.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Tamás Terlaky<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: While infeasibility detection is a routine task in linear optimization, conic optimization solvers often have difficulty dealing with it. The problem is further complicated by weakly infeasible conic models. We present a new set of stopping criteria for interior point conic optimization methods with self-dual embedding. The technique preserves the polynomial complexity of the interior point method and it can be further enhanced by preprocessing. The method is illustrated with the SeDuMi package.
