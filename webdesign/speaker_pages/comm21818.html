Title: Recent Advances in Lexicographic Constraints<br>Author: Jean-Francois Puget, Vice President, ILOG, 7 boulevard des Moulins, Carry-le-Rouet, 13620, France, puget@ilog.fr<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Adding lexicographic constraints is a way to remove all variable symmetries of a problem.  However this method has many drawbacks: One needs to state one constraint per symmetry, yielding an exponential number of constraints in the worst case; The method does not handle value symmetries; The order used in the lexicographic constraints may clash with the order used during a tree search.  We show how to effectively address these shortcomings using improved lexicographic constraints.
