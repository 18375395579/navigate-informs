However this method has many drawbacks: One needs to state one constraint per symmetry, yielding an exponential number of constraints in the worst case; The method does not handle value symmetries; The order used in the lexicographic constraints may clash with the order used during a tree search.  We show how to effectively address these shortcomings using improved lexicographic constraints.</br>
