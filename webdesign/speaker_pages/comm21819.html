Title: Clustering Multiple Instance Data<br>Author: Erhun Kundakcioglu, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall P.O.

We propose a novel MI setting for clustering, where a subset of data points are to be neglected during the regular clustering procedure. This approach is useful for biomedical applications where the aim is to discover the time of stimulus and detect the semantic features.
