Title: Impact Solver for Optimization Services<br>Author: Huanyuan Sheng, Northwestern University, Tech C231, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, h-sheng@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sanjay Mehrotra, Jun Ma<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We improve our IMPACT solver for broader range of optimization problems. New algorithms are being developed and tested for large scale mixed nonlinear integer problems. Combining with Optimization Services(OS) protocols, we plan to provide a robust solver service for applications of mathematical programming.
