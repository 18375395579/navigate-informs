<br>Title: Non-Permutation Schedules in Hybrid Flowshops: Tabu Search Algorithm Versus Genetic Algorithm</br><br>Author: Mir Abbas Bozorgirad, PhD Student, Oregon State University, School of Mech, Indust, and Mfgr Engr., 204 Rogers Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331-6001, United States of America, bozorgim@onid.orst.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): R. Logen Logendran</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In a non-permutation schedule, positions of jobs are correlated, i.e. the position of a job in a stage can affect its positions in other stages. Tabu search (TS) is very effective in dealing with scheduling problems, but it only allows single perturbations in generating new solutions, so it may not capture those interdependencies. Therefore, TS is compared to genetic algorithm, which performs multiple perturbations, to find the best algorithm in hybrid flowshops with a bi-criteria objective.</br>
