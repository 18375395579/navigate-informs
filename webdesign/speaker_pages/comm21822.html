Title: Scheduling the Excavation of an Open Pit Mine: An Integer Programming Approach<br>Author: Marcos Goycoolea, Assistant Professor, Universidad Adolfo Ibanez, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Oficina 534 C., Santiago, Chile, marcos.goycoolea@uai.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Espinoza, Eduardo Moreno, Enrique Rubio<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a classic integer programming formulation for the open-pit-mine scheduling problem. Using standard optimization software results in prohibitively long computation times. By introducing rounding heuristics (based on topological sortings), clever branching  rules, and pre-processing into the branch-and-bound process we significantly improve computational performance. Computational results from three medium-sized mines are presented.
