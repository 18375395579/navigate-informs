Title: En Route Traffic Flow Management in the Presence of Uncertainty<br>Author: Senay Solak, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts - Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, solak@som.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John-Paul Clarke<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe some recent results for a stochastic en route traffic flow management model. The model utilizes simulation-based methods to estimate probability distributions for airspace capacity over time. The resulting distributions are then used as input to a multistage stochastic integer program. Approximate solution techniques exploiting the structure of this large scale problem are also discussed.
