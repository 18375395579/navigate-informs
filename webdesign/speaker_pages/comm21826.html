The master problem is a set partitioning with an additional constraint for every shift. Each constraint requires the total quantity loaded to be less than the shift's loading capacity. For every shift, a pricing problem is solved by a labeling algorithm. Shift capacity constraints define knapsack structures. Hence, we use knapsack valid inequalities to get stronger lower bounds.</br>
