Title: An Exact Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multiple Shifts<br>Author: Said Dabia, TU/e, Pav F 19, Eindhoven, 5600MB, Netherlands, S.Dabia@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Tom van Woensel, Stefan Ropke<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We solve he Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multiple Shifts by a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm. The master problem is a set partitioning with an additional constraint for every shift. Each constraint requires the total quantity loaded to be less than the shift's loading capacity. For every shift, a pricing problem is solved by a labeling algorithm. Shift capacity constraints define knapsack structures. Hence, we use knapsack valid inequalities to get stronger lower bounds.
