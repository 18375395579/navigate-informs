<br>Title: Optimizing Importance Sampling Parameter for Portfolios of Credit Risky Assets</br><br>Author: Huiju Zhang, Fitch Ratings, One State Street Plaza, New York, NY, United States, huizhang@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Fu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We address the problem of finding the optimal importance sampling measure when simulating portfolios of credit risky assets.  We apply a gradient-based stochastic approximation method to find the parameters in the minimum variance problem when importance sampling is used. We also employ the CE method to solve the same minimization problem. Numerical results illustrating the variance reduction are presented for the estimation of the portfolios' expected loss, unexpected loss and quantiles.</br>
