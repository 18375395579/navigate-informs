Here, we extend this notion to the case of prob forecasts by introducing two simple methods for trimming & Winsorizing. Using data from the SPF, we compare these robust means to the mean and find that therobust means outperform the simple mean when it exhibits underconfidence.  We also propose a novel interior approach to deal with the case of overconfidence.</br>
