Box 8205, Raleigh, NC, 27695-8205, United States, kksivara@ncsu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Recently, Waki et al. have proposed a hierarchy  of structured semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations in the block-angular form for sparse polynomial optimization problems.    We discuss a conic interior point decomposition approach  for solving these block-angular SDPs in a parallel and distributed high performance computing environment. We will also present our computational experiences with the algorithm on the distributed Henry2 cluster at NC State University.</br>
