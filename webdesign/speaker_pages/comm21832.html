Title: Multi-period Reverse Logistics Network Design<br>Author: Stefan Nickel, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Kaiserstrasse 12, Karlsruhe, 76131, Germany, stefan.nickel@kit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sibel Alumur, Francisco Saldanha da Gama, Vedat Verter<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The configuration of the reverse logistics network is a complex problem comprising the determination of the optimal sites and capacities of collection centers, inspection centers, remanufacturing facilities, and/or recycling plants. In this talk, we propose a profit maximization modeling framework for reverse  logistics network design problems. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation that is flexible to incorporate most of the reverse network structures plausible in practice.
