Title: Common Information and Unique Disjointness<br>Author: Sebastian Pokutta, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, Ferst Dr., Atlanta, GA, United States of America, sebastian.pokutta@me.com<br>Coauthor(s): Gábor Braun<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Communication complexity and information theoretic approaches have been at the core of many recent lower bounds for extended formulations. A key problem is unique disjointness which is closely related to the extension complexity of the correlation polytope and the clique problem. We provide a new information-theoretic framework for lower bounding the nonnegative rank. Within this framework we present an (almost) optimal estimation of the nonnegative rank of the unique disjointness matrix.
