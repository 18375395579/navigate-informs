A key problem is unique disjointness which is closely related to the extension complexity of the correlation polytope and the clique problem. We provide a new information-theoretic framework for lower bounding the nonnegative rank. Within this framework we present an (almost) optimal estimation of the nonnegative rank of the unique disjointness matrix.</br>
