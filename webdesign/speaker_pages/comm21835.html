Title: A Hybrid LP/NLP Paradigm for Global Optimization Relaxations<br>Author: Nick Sahinidis, Swearingen Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, sahinidis@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Aida Khajavirad<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Polyhedral relaxations currently constitute the dominant approach in global optimization practice.  In this paper, we introduce a new relaxation paradigm for global optimization.  The proposed framework combines polyhedral and convex nonlinear relaxations, along with fail-safe techniques, convexity identification at each node of the search tree, and learning heuristics for automatic sub-problem algorithm selection.  We report extensive computational experiments with the proposed relaxations.
