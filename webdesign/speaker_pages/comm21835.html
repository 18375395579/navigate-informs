In this paper, we introduce a new relaxation paradigm for global optimization.  The proposed framework combines polyhedral and convex nonlinear relaxations, along with fail-safe techniques, convexity identification at each node of the search tree, and learning heuristics for automatic sub-problem algorithm selection.  We report extensive computational experiments with the proposed relaxations.</br>
