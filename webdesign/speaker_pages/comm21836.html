The difficulty arises from  two factors: (1) machine limitations that govern the minimum amount of  radiation delivery time, and (2) long treatment times due to the  complexity of optimized treatments. In the first scenario, if a  particular configuration of the radiation delivery device is used,  then it typically must deliver radiation for a minimum length of time.  Incorporation of such requirements in a mathematical model generally  requires additional constraints and binary variables, increasing the  difficulty of the optimization. In the second scenario, mathematically  optimized treatments commonly assign (small amounts of) radiation to  be delivered from many configurations, drastically increasing the time  needed to deliver the treatment (beam-on time). We examine these two  issues within the penalty-based sector-duration optimization model for  Gamma Knife(R) Perfexion(TM) (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) and the  combined sector-duration and isocentre optimization model to reduce  beam-on time and to ensure that machine limitations regarding delivery  times are met.
