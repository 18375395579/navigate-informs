Title: Decomposition based Methods for Allocation and Scheduling Problems Arising in System Design<br>Author: Michele Lombardi, DEIS, University of Bologna, via Risorgimento 2, Bologna, BO, 40136, Italy, mlombardi@deis.unibo.it<br>Coauthor(s): Michela Milano<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Allocation and scheduling problems commonly arise in the design flow of MPSoC systems. Due to the complexity of platform resources pure OR/AI/CP approaches do not perform well, thus the need for hybrid methods: Logic based Benders Decomposition (LBD) provides a way to integrate different techniques into a single solver. We present a number of LBD based approaches for allocation and scheduling problems; as a practical case the optimization of applications for the IBM Cell BE engine is considered.
