Due to the complexity of platform resources pure OR/AI/CP approaches do not perform well, thus the need for hybrid methods: Logic based Benders Decomposition (LBD) provides a way to integrate different techniques into a single solver. We present a number of LBD based approaches for allocation and scheduling problems; as a practical case the optimization of applications for the IBM Cell BE engine is considered.</br>
