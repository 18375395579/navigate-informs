Title: Modeling European Electricity Market Integration: A Minefield for Operations Researcher<br>Author: Florian Leuthold, Dresden University of Technology, Chair of Energy Economics, Dresden, 01062, Germany, Florian.Leuthold@tu-dresden.de<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Should transmission and energy markets be separated or integrated? Which incentive structure is needed for investing in transmission and generation? To which extend some players might be able to transfer their regional market power into an integrated market? Each of the mentioned issues is important for Europe. However, we report specific problems in terms of modelling and algorithms such as solving large scale nonlinear  and mixed integer optimization, or non-convex problems.
