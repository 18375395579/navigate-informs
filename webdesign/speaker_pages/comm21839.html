Title: Comparing Value Function-Based Approaches to Solving Two-stage Integer Programs<br>Author: Andrew Trapp, Assistant Professor, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, School of Business, 100 Institute Rd., Worcester, MA, 01609, United States of America, atrapp@wpi.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Two-stage integer programs with random right-hand sides can be solved via a value function reformulation. Explicit storage of the value function has both advantages and limitations. To overcome such limitations, we discuss theoretical and computational considerations of both level-set and constraint aggregation approaches, and elaborate on conditions under which each approach is effective.
