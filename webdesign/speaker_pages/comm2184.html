We incorporate the Path-based Cell Transmission Model as the underlying network loading procedure to propagate traffic from different paths of different O-Ds. This model guarantees that the traffic moves without holding-back phenomenon. Since the general optimization solvers are not able to solve the SO-DTA problem for medium-size network, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on method of successive average which can solve the SO-DTA problem for general networks. Extensive experiment results will be shown to illustrate the benefits of the proposed model and algorithm</br>
