Title: A Decomposition Method for Solving Equilibrium Programs with Equilibrium Constraints<br>Author: Sauleh Siddiqui, Assistant Professor, Johns Hopkins University, 2122 Massachusetts Ave NW, Apt 208, Washington, DC, 20008, United States of America, sauleh.siddiqui@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Gabriel<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Equilibrium Programs with Equilibrium Constraints (EPECs) are a type of two-level optimization problem that are computationally expensive to solve. In this talk, we provide a solution technique based on decomposition to tackle this class of problems. Theoretical support of our method will be provided as well as an application to the US Natural Gas market.
