For a Frechet class of distributions with overlapping marginals, we show that the portfolio optimization problem is efficiently solvable with linear programming. Lastly, we use a data-driven approach using real financial data to identify the Frechet class of distributions and then optimize the portfolio over this class of distributions.</br>
