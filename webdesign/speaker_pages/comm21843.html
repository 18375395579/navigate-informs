Title: Role of Price Spreads and Reoptimization in the Real Option Management of Commodity Storage Assets<br>Author: Nicola Secomandi, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, ns7@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper shows that the real option management of commodity storage assets is easy when the asset is fast and frictionless. In contrast, analysis of the general case justifies the use of reoptimization based heuristics for computing near optimal policies and lower bound estimates on the storage value. Further, the fast and frictionless asset optimal value function yields closed form penalties based on price spreads that simplify the estimation of near tight dual upper bounds.
