Title: A Hybrid Grasp-Ga Approach to the Capacitated VRPSPD<br>Author: Burak Eksioglu, Assistant Professor, Mississippi State University, 808 Red Oak Lane, Starkville, MS, 39759, United States, beksioglu@ise.msstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Arif Vural<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The logistics problem of simultaneous distribution and collection of commodities is studied. Commodities to be distributed are loaded at the depot and delivered to the customers, and items collected from the customers are transported back to the depot. The objective is to minimize total distance traveled. To solve the resulting problem a hybrid genetic algorithm is developed and tested on benchmark problems. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm produces good quality solutions.
