Title: Sequential Decision Models and Stochastic Programs for the Single Airport Ground Holding Problem<br>Author: Barry Liu, Booz Allen Hamilton, 3 Admiral Drive #F452, Emeryville, CA, 94608, United States, barryliu@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We model the single airport ground holding problem with airport capacity uncertainty using two approaches: multi-stage stochastic integer programs with probabilistic capacity scenario trees and sequential decision dynamic programs with Markov capacity evolution processes. In this paper, we discuss the mathematical relationship between the models and compare their performance in a real-world setting.
