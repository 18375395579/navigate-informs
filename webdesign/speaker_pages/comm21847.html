Box 750335, Dallas, TX, 75275-0335, United States, khaled@engr.smu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ahmed Abdelghany</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a heuristic-based approach for minimizing airlines schedule disruptions and operation costs associated with severe airspace flow programs. The approach considers primary decisions made by flight dispatchers such as flight slot substitution and rerouting outside the boundaries of the flow constrained area. Problem formulation, solution approach and preliminary results are presented.</br>
