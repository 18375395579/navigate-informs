Title: Managing Severe Airspace Flow Programs: The Airlines?Side of the Problem<br>Author: Khaled Abdelghany, Assistant Professor, Department of Environmental and Civil Engineering, Southern Methodist University, P.O. Box 750335, Dallas, TX, 75275-0335, United States, khaled@engr.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ahmed Abdelghany<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a heuristic-based approach for minimizing airlines schedule disruptions and operation costs associated with severe airspace flow programs. The approach considers primary decisions made by flight dispatchers such as flight slot substitution and rerouting outside the boundaries of the flow constrained area. Problem formulation, solution approach and preliminary results are presented.
