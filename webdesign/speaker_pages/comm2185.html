Title: Solving Large Scale Stochastic Programs Using Resampling in Stochastic Decomposition<br>Author: Suvrajeet Sen, Professor, Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, sen@sie.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhihong Zhou, Kai Huang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Stochastic Decomposition provides one of the most effective methods for solving two-stage stochastic programs.  We propose an extension that allows cuts based on re-sampling from a subset of outcomes that have been revealed in the past.  Convergence results, and computational experiments will be reported with this new version of Stochastic Decomposition
