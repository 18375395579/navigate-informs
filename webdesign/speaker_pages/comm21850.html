<br>Title: Stability and Convergence in Large-scale Dynamic Traffic Assignment</br><br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas, Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): C. Matthew Pool</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This work reviews, implements and compares existing techniques for finding equilibrium solutions in simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment and proposes novel approaches.  Numerical experiments assess the convergence and stability properties of these approaches in realistic-sized networks.</br>
