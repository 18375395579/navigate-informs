Title: A Stochastic Team Orienteering Problem with Budget and Time Constraints<br>Author: Belleh Fontem, PhD Candidate, University of Alabama, 300 Alston Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487, United States of America, bafontem@crimson.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Burcu Keskin, Sharif Melouk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting and reaching uncertain node locations on a network subject to budget and time constraints. We introduce a new very tight formulation for the resulting team orienteering problem and propose a robust optimization framework to find solutions that are immune to uncertainty affecting the time constraints. We solve test instances and glean general computational insights.
