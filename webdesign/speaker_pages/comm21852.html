Title: Algorithms for Model Selection Problems in Statistics<br>Author: Stephen Wright, Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, swright@cs.wisc.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many problems in statistics and signal processing can be formulated as large-scale optimization problems in which the objectives are the weighted sum of a convex smooth term (e.g. a least-squares function or a log-likelihood function) and a convex nonsmooth regularization term. We survey the many optimization algorithms that have been proposed, focusing in particular on gradient projection methods, and presenting computational results.
