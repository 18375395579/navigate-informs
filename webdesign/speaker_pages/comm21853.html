<br>Title: Using the PATH Solver with Open-Source Factorization Routines</br><br>Author: Michael Ferris, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin, 1210 West Dayton Street, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, ferris@cs.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Qian Li</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The PATH solver is  designed for solving Mixed Complementarity Problems and has been used extensively for problems in applied general equilibrium, economics and engineering. It is currently not open-source due to the underlying linear solver technology that is used for pivoting.  The extension of PATH to incorporate a number of  alternatives to the current (LUSOL) routines will be described, along with their benefits and drawbacks on a number of test problems arising in the literature.</br>
