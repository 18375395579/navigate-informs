<br>Title: Upper and Lower Bounding Strategies with Progressive Hedging for Stochastic Unit Commitment</br><br>Author: Jean-Paul Watson, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 5800, MS 1326, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1326, United States of America, jwatson@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Woodruff</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We describe a variety of algorithmic strategies for efficient lower and upper bounding of large-scale stochastic unit commitment problems via the Progressive Hedging algorithm. Upper bounding techniques include rho setting, bundling, and asynchronous computation. The tuning of newly developed lower bounding techniques for Progressive Hedging will also be discussed.</br>
