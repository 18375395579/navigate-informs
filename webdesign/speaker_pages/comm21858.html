Title: Integrated Charge Batching and Casting Width Selection at Baosteel<br>Author: Zhi-Long Chen, Professor, University of Maryland, Robert H.

For the general problem, we develop a column generation based branch and bound (B&B) solution approach to obtain optimal solutions. We also consider a frequently occurring case of the problem where each steel grade is incompatible with any other grade. For this special case, we develop a two-level polynomial-time algorithm to obtain optimal solutions.
