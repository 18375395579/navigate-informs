Title: Performance of Weighted Barrier Decomposition Method for Two Stage Stochastic Conic Programming<br>Author: Sanjay Mehrotra, Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 sheridan road, Evanston, il, 60201, United States of America, mehrotra@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Computational results are presented showing that an efficient and stable implementation of primal decomposition method is possible, however, the implementation uses a weighted barrier.  To our knowledge this is the first time apriori selection of weights have given consistently improved performance of the log-barrier methods.  We explain the reasons for the better performance of the weighted barrier decomposition method.
