Title: A Regularized Smoothing Stochastic Approximation Algorithm for Stochastic Variational Inequalities<br>Author: Farzad Yousefian, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Dept. of Industrial & Systems Eng, 104 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, 61801, United States of America, yousefi1@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag, Angelia Nedich<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic variational inequality problem with a monotone mapping over a compact and convex set and present a regularized smoothed stochastic approximation scheme wherein stepsize, smoothing, and regularization parameters are updated iteratively. Under suitable assumptions, we show the convergence in an almost-sure sense. Rate estimates that relate iterates to their counterparts derived from the Tikhonov trajectory associated with a deterministic problem are also provided.
