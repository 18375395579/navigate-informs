These techniques are primarily based on scenarios, which in case of large-scale models increase considerably the size of the problems to be solved according to the number of scenarios, resulting in intractable problems. An iterative scheme is proposed which allows obtaining the equivalent solution for a given number of scenarios but solving problems with a reduced number of scenarios.</br>
