Title: Integer Programming Formulation for Graph and Network Optimization Problems<br>Author: Bahram Alidaee, Professor, The University of Mississippi, School of Business Administration, University, MS, 38677, United States, balidaee@bus.olemiss.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haibo Wang, Mustafa Altinakar<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Graph and networks optimization have been powerful tools in solving complex problems arising in social sciences, mathematics, engineering, and sciences. Formulating a graph problem as a natural integer program (IP) is often a challenging task. The present study provides a unified framework for IP formulation of graph optimization problems. Application of the framework in several areas including homeland security, disasters management, coding theory, etc. will be discussed.
