<br>Title: A Model Enhancement Heuristic for Building Aircraft Maintenance Personnel Rosters under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Philippe De Bruecker, KU Leuven, Naamsestraat 69 - bus 3555, Leuven, 3000, Belgium, philippe.debruecker@econ.kuleuven.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erik Demeulemeester, Jeroen Beliën, Jorne Van den Bergh</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a heuristic approach for building workforce schedules at an aircraft maintenance company located at Brussels Airport. A model enhancement algorithm is proposed to minimize the labour costs under stochastic constraints. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with a computational experiment and compare the results to other techniques. A simulation experiment proves that the achieved rosters can ensure the desired service level set by the company.</br>
