Title: Mixed Convexity and Optimization Results for an (S-1,S) Inventory Model with Time Limit on Backorders<br>Author: Emre Tokgoz, Faculty - Lecturer, University of Oklahoma, 601 Elm Ave. Room 423, Norman, OK, 73019, United States of America, Emre.Tokgoz-1@ou.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hillel Kumin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, strong computational mixed convexity results are obtained for the Erlang delay and loss formulae by applying a new convexity technique. This new technique is applied to obtain computational joint mixed variable convexity and optimization results for a cost function associated with an (S-1,S) inventory model suggested by Das (1977).
