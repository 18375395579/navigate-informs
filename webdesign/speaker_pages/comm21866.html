Title: Integration of Count Data Analysis in Dynamic Programming Approach for Stochastic Truckload Routing<br>Author: Ginny Miori, Assistant Professor, Department of Decision & System Sciences, St. Joseph's University, 333 Mandeville Hall, 5600 City Avenue, Philadelphia, PA, 19131, United States, vmiori@comcast.net<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We discuss the integration of econometric count data regression into the stochastic truckload routing problem (TRP). A penalty method is applied to the TRP, which is then reformulated as a Markov process.?This facilitates a solution using dynamic programming (DP)techniques. The two outpus of count data, predicted counts and the likelihood of those counts, are employed as transition probabilities (likelihoods) and in the generation of the expected cost-to-go for the DP solution.
