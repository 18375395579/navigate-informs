Title: Dynamic Programming for Efficient Container Inspection Policies<br>Author: Noam Goldberg, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Rd, Piscataway, United States of America, ngoldberg@rutcor.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Kantor, Jonathan Word, Endre Boros<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally combining any given set of stochastically independent diagnostic tests into an inspection system that maximizes detection subject to a budget constraint.    Our inspection policies can be represented  as mixtures of decision trees.    We present a dynamic programming algorithm that enumerates all efficient, undominated, inspection policies.  Our approach directly solves the bicriterion optimization problem, allowing for sensitivity analysis.
