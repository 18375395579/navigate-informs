Title: Randomized Heuristics for Handover Minimization in Mobility Networks<br>Author: Mauricio Resende, AT&T Labs Research, 180 Park Avenue, C241, Florham Park, NJ, 07932, United States of America, mgcr@research.att.com<br>Coauthor(s): Luis Morán-Mirabal, Jos?Luis González-Velarde, Ricardo SIlva<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The Handover Minimization Problem (HMP) in Mobility Networks assigns  base stations (BS) to radio network controllers (RNC) such that RNC  capacity is not violated and the number of handovers between BSs connected to different RNCs is minimized. We show that state-of-the-art IP solvers fail on all but the smallest instances of the HMP. We propose several heuristics for the HMP, including a GRASP with path-relinking (PR), a GRASP with evolutionary PR, and a biased random-key genetic algorithm.
