Title: Irregular Polyomino Tilings via Integer Programming<br>Author: Serdar Karademir, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, United States of America, sek73@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Oleg Prokopyev<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Polyominoes are created by connecting unit squares along an edge. Recently, irregular polyomino tilings have been used in the design of array antennas to improve their imaging capabilities. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear exact set covering model where irregularity is measured using the information theoretic entropy concept. A column generation approach along with novel branching and lower bounding schemes is proposed. We also provide efficient heuristics and approximation algorithms.
