Recently, irregular polyomino tilings have been used in the design of array antennas to improve their imaging capabilities. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear exact set covering model where irregularity is measured using the information theoretic entropy concept. A column generation approach along with novel branching and lower bounding schemes is proposed. We also provide efficient heuristics and approximation algorithms.</br>
