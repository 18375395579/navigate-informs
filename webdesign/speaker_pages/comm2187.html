Todd<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: It is known that Frank-Wolfe type algorithms are very useful in  finding solutions for the D-optimal design problem of statistics,  and its dual, the Minimum Volume Enclosing Ellipsoid problem. We devise  similar algorithms for other optimal design problems such as the A-optimal  design problem. These algorithms are also locally linearly convergent and  have attractive features confirmed by computational results.
