Title: Preprocessing and regularization for degenerate semidefinite programs<br>Author: Yuen-Lam Vris Cheung, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, Canada, yl2cheun@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Simon Schurr, Henry Wolkowicz<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a backward stable preprocessing technique for semidefinite programming (SDP) that applies the Borwein-Wolkowicz facial reduction process to find a rank-revealing rotation of the problem, resulting in a smaller and well-posed problem that can be solved more accurately by standard SDP solvers. We also examine the implications of the minimum number of facial reductions required, on the theoretical and numerical aspects of solving that instance via interior point methods.
