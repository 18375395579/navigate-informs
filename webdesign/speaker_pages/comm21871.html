We provide the open source OS library which is based on a set of Optimization Services Protocols (OSP). The library supports the solution of a wide variety of optimization problem types in a loosely coupled distributed environment. We also provide OS server software for users to host their own Optimization Services. In particular, we demo the OS integration in Apache's Tomcat Web server.
