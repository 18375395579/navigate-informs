Title: Aircraft Sizing & Allocation as a System-of-systems Problem via Surrogates & Multiobjective Design<br>Author: Joshua Frommer, The Boeing Company, PO Box 3707 MC 0R-MK, Seattle, WA, 98124-2207, United States, joshua.b.frommer@boeing.com<br>Coauthor(s): William Crossley<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Choosing the best mixture of systems to provide desired capabilities is a system-of-systems problem.  A multiobjective MINLP problem formulation describes simultaneous aircraft sizing and fleet allocation to maximize a capability objective and minimize a cost objective.  Surrogate models replace the analysis for predicting characteristics of new aircraft, and a genetic algorithm generates solutions to the problem.  This formulation allows a fleet-level assessment of a new aircraft technology.
