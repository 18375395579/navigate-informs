<br>Title: A Dynamic Traveling Salesman Problem with Stochastic Arc Costs</br><br>Author: Alejandro Toriello, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Ave, GER 240, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, toriello@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Haskell, Michael Poremba</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a dynamic TSP with stochastic arc costs and use approximate linear programming to obtain a semi-infinite linear programming lower bound. The bound requires only expected costs and the support set, and is valid for any distribution with these parameters. Though NP-hard for general support sets, we show that the bound can be solved efficiently for polytopes with polynomially many extreme points and hyper-rectangles. We analyze the price-directed policy and derive performance guarantees.</br>
