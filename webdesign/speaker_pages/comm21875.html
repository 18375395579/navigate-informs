<br>Title: Price Optimization Under Generalized Extreme Value Models</br><br>Author: Amr Farahat, Assistant Professor, Washington University in St. Louis, Olin Business School, St. Louis, MO, United States of America, farahat@wustl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Renyu (Philip) Zhang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the multi-product price optimization problem under the Generalized Extreme Value discrete choice model proposed by McFadden (1978). We present structural results leading to a tractable approach to solving this problem which exhibits the non-concavity issues inherent in its special case: the (nested) multinomial logit model.</br>
