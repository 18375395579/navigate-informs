Title: Flexible Shift Scheduling of Medical Residents<br>Author: Jens Brunner, Technische Universität München, Arcisstraße 21, München, D-80333, Germany, jens.brunner@wi.tum.de<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Bard, Rainer Kolisch<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This research addresses a shift scheduling problem in which medical residents are assigned to demand periods.  We propose a new modeling approach that requires shifts to be generated implicitly.  The objective is to minimize the paid out overtime hours under the restrictions given by the labor agreement.  Our problem is formulated as a mixed-integer program and solved with CPLEX.  Computational results indicate that high quality schedules can be obtained.
