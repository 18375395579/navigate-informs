Results on a set of instances from QAPLIB demonstrate the improvement of our TS multi-start variants over the classic tabu search approach widely used for the QAP. We also show that our new procedures are highly competitive with the best recently introduced methods from the literature, including more complex hybrid approaches.</br>
