Title: Extended Reformulation of Stochastic Lot-sizing Problem<br>Author: Chaoyue Zhao, cherryzhao09@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yongpei Guan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk, we study efficient dynamic programming algorithms for stochastic lot-sizing problems with different variations (e.g., considering backlogging, inventory bound, and order capacities). We analyze the optimal inventory condition for each case, and accordingly, based on these conditions, we discover the extended reformulation of the stochastic lot-sizing problem for each case.
