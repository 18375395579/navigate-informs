Title: Optimal Sensor Deployment to Increase the Security of the Minimal Exposure Path<br>Author: Ezgi Karabulut, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, ezgi.karabulut@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kuban Altinel, Necati Aras<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Maximizing the security of maximal breach path, also known as the minimal exposure path, is an important approach in the design of WSN. This research develops a mixed integer bilevel programming formulation for the Stackelberg game between the intruder and the defender, to determine the sensor locations that maximize the exposure on the minimal exposure path. There are two basic heuristics proposed to solve this bilevel optimization problem, both employing tabu search algorithm.
