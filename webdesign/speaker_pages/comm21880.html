The problem is formulated as an integer goal program and a three-phase methodology is proposed to find solutions. After pre-processing, a commercial solver is used to obtain tentative solutions and then improvements are made in the post-processing step. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated by analyzing real data.</br>
