Title: Automatic Algorithm Selection for Nonlinear Optimization Problems<br>Author: Zsolt Csizmadia, FICO, FICO House, Starley Way, Birmingham, B37 7GN, United Kingdom, ZsoltCsizmadia@fico.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Performance of nonlinear optimization problems depend on the solution method used, a nontrivial selection requiring expert knowledge. The best modeling practice has traditionally been to keep the solution methods available in mind, limiting the freedom of the modeler.   The talk will discuss problem characteristics that may guide the automatic selection of the best fitting method including identification of special problem classes, presolve and deciding between first and second order methods.
