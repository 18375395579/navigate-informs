<br>Title: Competitive Markov Decision Process Interdiction</br><br>Author: Matthew Bailey, Asst. Professor, Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA, United States of America, mdbailey@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Halil Bayrak</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consider a problem where an inspector controls a perimeter by installing static detection resources and subsequently devising a dynamic inspection policy, whereas a smuggler attempts to smuggle materials through the perimeter without being detected. We formulate this problem as the interdiction of a competitive Markov decision process and present a linear mixed integer model.  In addition, we develop a heuristic algorithm to solve larger problem instances.</br>
