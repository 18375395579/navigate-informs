But designing efficient single arrays is hard, because it is very important to estimate interactions between control and noise factors for parameter design. In this work we show that the importance of effects and hierarchy of effects are two different concepts and propose a Bayesian approach to integrate the two concepts in the design of single arrays.</br>
