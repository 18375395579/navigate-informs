Title: The Value of Information and Resources in Online Routing<br>Author: Michael Wagner, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, mikew@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Jaillet<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate the value of information and resources in online routing problems, where the problem instance is revealed incrementally. We derive new competitive ratio bounds for generalized versions of the online TSP(with precedence constraints, capacity constraints and multiple vehicles). We consider resource augmentation, where we give the online algorithm additional resources: faster servers, larger capacities and advanced information.
