Title: Hunting Drug Smugglers: An Optimal Search Problem in Continuous Time and Space<br>Author: Jesse Pietz, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Road, Monterey, CA, United States of America, japietz@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Johannes Royset<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider search for moving targets in continuous time and space, and formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear program whose solution yields an optimal search plan.  We highlight features of this highly challenging problem that lead to specialized algorithms and discuss solutions for application to drug smuggling interdiction operations.
