Title: Interactive Evolutionary Multicriteria Scheduling<br>Author: Jon Marquis, 5440 West Whitten Street, Chandler, AZ, 85226, United States of America, jonemailbox1@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): John Fowler, Esma Gel, Murat Koksalan, Pekka Korhonen, Jyrki Wallenius<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We show an approach to multicriteria parallel machine job scheduling that uses an interactive genetic algorithm to assign jobs to machines and a scheduling heuristic to order those jobs.  The algorithm interacts with the decision maker to elicit preference information and guide the algorithm’s search.  We demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness for two and three criteria problems.
