Title: Selecting Optimal Alternatives and Risk Reduction Strategies in Decision Trees<br>Author: Evrim Dalkiran, PhD Student, Virginia Tech, 250 Durham Hall, ISE Department (0118), Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, dalkiran@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Theodore S. Glickman, Hanif Sherali<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this study, a strategic risk management problem involving allocation of resources and selection of decision alternatives is investigated to minimize the risk in the event of a hazardous occurrence.Using a decision tree to represent the cascading sequences of events as controlled by decisions and investment alternatives, problem is modeled as a nonconvex mixed-integer 0-1 factorable program.A branch-and-bound algorithm is developed for which convergence and computational results are discussed.
