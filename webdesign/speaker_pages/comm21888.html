Title: Tutorial: Metaheuristic Hybridization with GRASP<br>Author: Mauricio Resende, Lead Member of Technical Staff, AT&T Labs Research, 180 Park Avenue, Room C241, Florham Park, NJ, 07932, United States of America, mgcr@research.att.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: GRASP, or greedy randomized adaptive search procedure, is a multi-start metaheuristic that repeatedly applies local search starting from solutions constructed by a randomized greedy algorithm. In this tutorial we consider ways to hybridize GRASP to create new and more effective metaheuristics. We consider several types of hybridizations: constructive procedures, enhanced local search, memory structures, and cost reformulations.
