Title: Efficient Context-Free Grammar Constraints<br>Author: Meinolf Sellmann, Brown University, PO Box 1910, Providence, RI, United States of America, sello@cs.brown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Serdar Kadioglu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recently, constraints based on grammars higher up in the Chomsky hierarchy were introduced. We devise a time- and space-efficient incremental arc-consistency algorithm for context-free grammars. Particularly, we show how to filter a sequence of monotonically tightening problems in cubic time and quadratic space. Experiments on a scheduling problem show orders of magnitude improvements in time and space consumption.
