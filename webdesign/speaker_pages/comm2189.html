Title: Strengthened MILP Formulations for Indicator Activated Piecewise-linear Functions<br>Author: James Luedtke, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, jrluedt1@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Linderoth, Srikrishna Sridhar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider mixed-integer linear programming formulations for piecewise-linear functions that are evaluated only when an indicator variable is turned on.  A direct application of standard MIP formulations for such PLFs yields a formulation that is not locally ideal.  We describe a simple alternative that is locally ideal, and demonstrate its computational advantage.
