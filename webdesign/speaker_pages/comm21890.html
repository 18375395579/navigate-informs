Title: Value Function Approximations for Multistage Linear Programs<br>Author: Warren Powell, Professor, Princeton University, Engineering Quadrangle, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, powell@princeton.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe how high-quality, practical solutions can be obtained for multistage stochastic linear programs using approximate dynamic programming.  The first step involves setting up Bellman's equation using the post-decision state variable.  The next step involves finding value function approximations that can be used within an LP solver.  We present a series of approximation strategies, and describe where they have proven successful, as well as possible limitations.
