Title: Automated Mechanism Design, with Applications to Auctions<br>Author: Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Sandia National Labs, 7011 East Ave, Livermore, CA, 94550, United States of America, eug.vorobey@gmail.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present general methods for automated mechanism design when both the design, and player strategy spaces are constrained.  We offer Bayesian and worst-case (robust) formulations, and present a technique based on stochastic search.  Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in a variety of auction settings.
