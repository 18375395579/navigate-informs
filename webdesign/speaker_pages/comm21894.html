Title: Parameter Choice in Sample-path Algorithms for Root Finding and Optimization<br>Author: Raghu Pasupathy, Virginia Tech, 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, United States of America, pasupath@vt.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Retrospective Approximation (RA) is a sample-path technique for solving simulation-optimization and stochastic root-finding problems. RA works by generating and solving a sequence of deterministic problems, using specified sample-size and error-tolerance sequences. In this talk, we provide guidance on choosing these sequences by characterizing a class that is superior to others in a certain precisely defined sense. We provide numerical examples illustrating the key results.
