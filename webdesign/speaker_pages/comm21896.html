<br>Title: Robust Radiotherapy Optimization via Parameterized Edge-Enhancements</br><br>Author: Timothy Chan, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-130, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, tcychan@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Bortfeld, John Tsitsiklis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of radiotherapy treatment planning under uncertainty and use a parameterized approach to deliver a robust solution. We analyze the relationship between uncertainty and solution structure, deriving simple bounds on the uncertainty that identify the resulting complexity of the robust solution. These results can be used to guide medical physicists in producing treatments plans that will be robust to the variety of uncertainties realized in practice.</br>
