Title: Continuous Dynamical Systems for Global Optimization<br>Author: Amir Ali Ahmadi, Goldstine Fellow, IBM Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Heights,, NY, United States of America, a_a_a@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sanjeeb Dash, Oktay Gunluk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We explore connections between stability of equilibrium points of cubic differential equations and feasibility of basic semialgebraic sets. This allows for (i) a methodology for providing certificates of infeasibility of such sets presented as Lyapunov functions and obtained by semidefinite programming, and (ii) a heuristic for finding feasible solutions to a broad class of constraint satisfaction problems by simulating the solution of a differential equation.
