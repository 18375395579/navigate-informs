Title: Self-concordant Tree and Decomposition Based Interior Point Methods for Stochastic Convex<br>Author: Michael Chen, Ph.D Candidate, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road IEMS, Evanston, IL, 60201, United States, michael-chen@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sanjay Mehrotra<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider barrier problems associated with two-stage and multistage stochastic programs. We show that in their barrier forms, each objective function and barrier recourse function of any stages are self-concordant families with respect to the barrier parameter.  In particular, we show that the first stage complexity value of the problem increases additively with the number of stages and scenarios.
