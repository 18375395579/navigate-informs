Title: Robust Facility Location under Demand Location Uncertainty<br>Author: Auyon Siddiq, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, Canada, asiddiq@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Chan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We generalize classical facility location problems within a two-stage robust optimization framework by assuming each demand point is only known to lie within a continuous and bounded uncertainty region. We discuss an efficient row-and-column generation algorithm and present bounds on the error introduced by the discretization of the continuous uncertainty regions. We conclude with a computational study using cardiac arrest data from the City of Toronto.
