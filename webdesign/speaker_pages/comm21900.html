Ravi, Latife Genc Kaya<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a quadratic programming (QP) problem where the objective is to minimize the product of two non-negative linear cost functions over a given polytope. We present a PTAS by reformulating the QP as a parameterized LP and rounding the optimal solution. Our algorithm returns an extreme point solution and thus applies directly to combinatorial 0-1 problems for which the convex hull of feasible integer solutions or its dominant is known such as spanning tree, shortest path and min-cut.
