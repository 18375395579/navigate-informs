We obtain a greedy bound that exists in all coin systems, and then propose a partial greedy method. Its run time is independent of the change amount. The greedy bound can also be used in testing whether a coin system is canonical, and it outperforms existing bounds. Finally, an algebraic structure of compositions is presented to simplify the analysis of large coin systems.
