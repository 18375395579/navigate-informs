<br>Title: A Greedy Bound for the Change-making Problem</br><br>Author: Ping Heidi Huang, Ph.D Candidate, Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, 403 W. State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, huang74@exchange.purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kwei Tang, Thomas Morin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The goal of the generalized changing-making problem is to minimize the total cost of using a set of coins to make a change. We obtain a greedy bound that exists in all coin systems, and then propose a partial greedy method. Its run time is independent of the change amount. The greedy bound can also be used in testing whether a coin system is canonical, and it outperforms existing bounds. Finally, an algebraic structure of compositions is presented to simplify the analysis of large coin systems.</br>
