<br>Title: Computational Approaches for Beam Angle and Fluence Map Optimization in IMRT</br><br>Author: Gino Lim, Assistant Professor, University of Houston, 4800 Calhoun Road, E211, Engineering Building 2, Houston, TX, 77204, United States, ginolim@uh.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present computational approaches for optimizing beam angles and fluence maps in IMRT planning for cancer patients. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model and a linear programming (LP) model are used to find an optimal set of beam angles and their corresponding fluence maps.  The LP model is solved using the interior point method while the MIP model is solved using branch-and-bound. In order to reduce the computational burden for solving the optimization models, we introduce iterative beam angle elimination algorithms in which an insignificant beam angle is eliminated in each iteration.</br>
