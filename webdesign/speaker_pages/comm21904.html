Title: Probability Inequalities with General Deviation Measures<br>Author: Bogdan Grechuk, Stevens Institute of Technology, bgrechuk@stevens.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The consistency of law-invariant deviation measures, defined by  Rockafellar et al., with concave ordering has been used to develop  a new approach for minimization of law-invariant deviation  measures. This approach has been applied for constructing Chebyshev's and Kolmogorov's inequalities with general deviation measures. Generalized Chebyshev's inequalities are used for convex approximation of portfolio optimization problem with chance constraint.
