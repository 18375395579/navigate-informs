The follower solves an assignment problem maximizing his profit, while the leader may interdict removing some of the nodes of the graph. The leader’s task is to minimize the total cost given by the cost of interdiction plus the cost of the assignments made by the follower. The problem is shown to be NP-hard. We also derive equivalent linear mixed 0-1 programming reformulations and discuss possible heuristic solution approaches.</br>
