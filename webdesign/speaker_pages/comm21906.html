Title: A Novel Method for Solving Continuous-state POMDPs<br>Author: Enlu Zhou, Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, enluzhou@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Marcus, Michael Fu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Most research on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) has been focused on finite-state space problems, where the belief space is a finite-dimensional simplex. However, many practical problems have continuous state spaces, and hence the belief space is infinite dimensional. To address this difficulty, we integrate modified projection particle filtering into MDP solving techniques to greatly reduce the dimension of the belief space and make continuous-state POMDPs tractable.
