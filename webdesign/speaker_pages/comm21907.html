Title: Inverse Stochastic Linear Programming<br>Author: Gorkem Saka, PhD Candidate, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, gos2@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Inverse optimization perturbs objective function to make an initial feasible solution optimal with respect to perturbed objective function while minimizing cost of perturbation. We extend inverse optimization to two-stage stochastic linear programs with a finite number of scenarios. Since the resulting model grows with number of scenarios, we present decomposition approaches for solving these problems. We anticipate that as the size of the problem increases, decomposition will become essential.
