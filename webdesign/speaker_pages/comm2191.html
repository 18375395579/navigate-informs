Title: Eliciting Patient Preferences: An Inverse MDP<br>Author: Zeynep Erkin, PhD student, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, zeyneperkin@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Maillart, Matthew Bailey, Andrew Schaefer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A Markov decision process model for determining the optimal timing of a living-donor liver transplant to maximize patient life expectancy has been well-studied in the literature. Current practice, however, appears to be suboptimal.  Therefore, we examine alternative reward structures under which current practice is optimal. To generate the new rewards, we solve a linear program that minimizes the distance between the data-estimated reward vectors and the new reward vectors.
