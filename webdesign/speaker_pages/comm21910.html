We introduce a sequential design for computer experiments where the goal is to find an input setting optimizing one output subject to a constraint determined by a second output.  The idea of the methods is to compute the posterior expected improvement over the current optimum for each untested site; the design selects the next site to maximize the expected improvement.</br>
