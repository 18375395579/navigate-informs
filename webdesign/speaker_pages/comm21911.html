Title: Embedding Preferences in DEA: A Penalty Function Approach to Restricting Weights<br>Author: Warren Sutton, PhD Candidate, Unversity of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, wsutton@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stanko Dimitrov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Traditional DEA models assume total flexibility in selection of weights, however this assumption can lead to several variables being ignored in determining the efficiency score. Existing methods constrain weight flexibility thus removing possible feasible solutions, but the proposed method does not effect feasibility.
