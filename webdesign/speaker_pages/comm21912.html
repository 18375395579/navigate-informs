Title: Partition-based Algorithms for Solving Two-stage Stochastic Programs<br>Author: Yongjia Song, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, ysong29@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Luedtke<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We studied partition-based algorithms for solving two-stage stochastic linear programs. The basic idea is to iteratively solve a smaller problem with scenarios aggregated according to a specific partition, and refine the partition based on the obtained relaxation solution value. Computational results indicates that this approach is particularly effective when the scenario size is large.
