Thai, J. Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Social networks, computer networks, etc., are examples of real-world networks in which an attacker may try to exploit the network structure in order to propagate some type of influence such as rumors, infections, etc. over the nodes. We consider a scenario in which we can protect the nodes from being the source of such malicious influence propagation. We suggest a mixed-integer bilevel program, a set of valid inequalities, and an exact algorithm tailored for the problem.</br>
