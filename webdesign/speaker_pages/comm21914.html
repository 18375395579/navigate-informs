<br>Title: A Moving Boundary Approach to American Option Pricing</br><br>Author: Kumar Muthuraman, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 315 North Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States, kumar@purdue.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This talk presents a computational method to find the optimal exercise boundary (policy) and the price of an American option. The method uses a boundary guess and the associated value of using the guessed boundary, to construct an improved boundary. It can be shown that the sequence of boundaries obtained is monotone and converges to the optimal exercise boundary. I will also demonstrate the generality of this approach to other problems in finance.</br>
