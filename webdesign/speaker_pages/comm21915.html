Title: A Comparison of Resource Allocation Algorithms for Traffic Flow Management with Rerouting<br>Author: Nathaniel Gaertner, Analyst, Metron Aviation, 131 Elden St. Ste 200, Herndon, VA, 20170, United States of America, gaertner@metronaviation.com<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Hoffman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The need to address the problem of resource allocation in traffic flow management while incorporating rerouting as well as delay has spawned a variety of algorithms and models, ranging in approach from classic optimization to heuristics. Though efficiency in terms of total cost is a primary driver, consideration should also be given to other performance metrics such as equity, predictability, flexibility, and runtime. We evaluate and compare alternative algorithms for solving this problem.
