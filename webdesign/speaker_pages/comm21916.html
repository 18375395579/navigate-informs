<br>Title: Mobility Allowance Shuttle Transit (MAST) Services: Description, Formulation and Optimization</br><br>Author: Luca Quadrifoglio, Assistant Professor, Zachry Department of Civil Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, quadrifo@usc.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Mobility Allowance Shuttle Transit (MAST) vehicles follow a fixed route with checkpoints, but deviate from the path to pick up and drop off passengers. The static MAST scheduling problem is formulated as an NP-Hard mixed integer linear program. Three sets of logic cuts greatly speed up the optimal solution search.</br>
