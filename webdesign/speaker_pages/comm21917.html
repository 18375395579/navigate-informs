Title: Heuristic and Exact Algorithms for Packing Discs in a Minimal Container Circle<br>Author: Wei Xie, Graduate Student, Department of Chemical & Biomolecular, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 600 S. Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, wxie@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nick Sahinidis<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We address the problem of packing n discs of given radii in a way that minimizes the radius of a container circle.  We present several greedy heuristics as well as branch-and-bound-based global optimization algorithms for this problem.  Extensive computational results are presented for problems with up to 50 discs.
