<br>Title: Optimization of Multilevel Facility Location Problems in Postal Logistics</br><br>Author: Jens Wollenweber, RWTH Aachen, Templergraben 64, Aachen, -, Germany, wollenweber@or.rwth-aachen.de</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Many location problems in postal logistics can be modeled as multilevel capacitated facility location problems. We introduce such a multilevel problem with additional properties and propose a two-phase heuristic approach which calculates near optimal solution for instances with up to 3,000 candidate facilities. The approach consists of a construction heuristic, based on the solution of the LP-relaxation, and of a variable neighborhood improvement heuristic in the second phase.</br>
