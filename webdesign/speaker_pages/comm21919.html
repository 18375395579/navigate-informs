Title: Method of Successive Weighted Averages for Stochastic User Equilibrium<br>Author: Xiao-Zheng He, University of Minnesota, hexxx069@tc.umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Henry Liu, Bingsheng He<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: SUE models are slow to converge because the auxiliary flow pattern generated at each iteration of the Method of Successive Averages (MSA) contributes equally to the final solution.  We introduce the method of successive weighted averages (MSWA).  Computation results show the convergence speedup factor is in a manner of magnitude.
