Title: Semi-continuous Knapsack Polyhedron with Multiple GUB Constraints<br>Author: Daniel Espinoza, Assistant Professor, University of Chile, Av. Republica 701, Santiago, 8370439, Chile, daespino@gmail.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a polyhedron were variables are either zero, or take values in a bounded set; these variables are linked by a knapsack constraint and several disjoint clique inequalities. In this talk we present valid inequalities for this set, multi-dimensional sequence-independent lifting functions, separation heuristics and computational experiments performed on real-world unit-commitment instances. This works builds on previous works by the authors and also from lifting techniques developed by Zeng and Richard.
