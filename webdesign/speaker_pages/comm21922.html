Title: Unified Stochastic and Robust Unit Commitment<br>Author: Chaoyue Zhao, University of Florida, United States of America, cherryzhao09@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yongpei Guan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we propose a unified stochastic and robust approach to provide day-ahead unit commitment decisions. By introducing weights for the components for the stochastic and robust parts in the objective function, this innovative model can achieve a low expected total cost while ensuring the system robustness. Finally, a Benders?decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. The computational results verify our proposed approach and algorithm.
