<br>Title: Orthogonal-Maximin Latin Hypercube Designs</br><br>Author: Ying Hung, Georgia Institute of Technology, yhung@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roshan Vengazhiyil</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A randomly generated Latin hypercube design (LHD) can be quite structured. There are procedures to find good LHDs by minimizing the pairwise correlations or maximizing the inter-site distances. In this article we have shown that these two criteria need not agree with each other. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective optimization approach to find good LHDs. Several examples are presented to show that the new algorithm is fast and that the optimal designs are good in terms of both  criteria.</br>
