Title: Models and Algorithms for Distributionally Robust Least Squares Problem<br>Author: He Zhang, PhD Candidate, & Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Dept. of Industrial Engineering, 2145 Sheridan Road, Room C210, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, hezhang2012@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sanjay Mehrotra<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present different robust frameworks using probabilistic ambiguity descriptions of the input data in the least squares problems. The three probability ambiguity descriptions are given by: (1) confidence interval over the first two moments; (2) bounds on the probability measure with moments constraints; (3) Kantorovich probability distance from a given measure. We derive equivalent formulations and show that the resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently.
