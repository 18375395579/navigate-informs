Title: Application of SIMD Instructions in Solving Random 3-dimensional Assignment Problems<br>Author: Mohammad Mirghorbani, The University of Iowa, 3131 Seamans Center, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, seyedmohamma-mirghorbaninokandeh@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pavlo Krokhmal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We show how SIMD instructions can be utilized to vectorize an existing branch and bound method, BitCLQ, designed to enumerate k-cliques in special k-partite graphs. The k-cliques found map to guaranteed high-quality solutions of random 3-dimensional assignment problems. We observed up to 100% improvement in the performance of BitCLQ on the same machine after vectorization.
