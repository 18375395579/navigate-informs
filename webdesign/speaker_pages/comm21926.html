Existing algorithms derive linearizations over the solution of certain sub-problems. We show how, using line-search methods, we obtain other points to take more efficient linearizations. Furthermore, we investigate using other sub-problems. Finally in numerical results, we compare the performance of new strategies against the existing algorithms.
