Title: Decomposition Strategies for Stochastic Mixed-integer Nonlinear Programs with Energy Applications<br>Author: Paul I. Barton, Lammot du Pont Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 66-464, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, pib@mit.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a recently developed deterministic global optimization approach with running time that scales linearly with the number of scenarios considered. This enables the solution of large-scale instances of problems that arise in the optimization of a variety of energy systems under uncertainty, such as the planning of natural gas production infrastructure, the design of flexible energy polygeneration systems, feedstock selection for oil refineries, etc.
