<br>Title: The DIRECT Global Optimization Algorithm with Nonlinear Equality Constraints</br><br>Author: Don Jones, Technical Fellow, General Motors, 1970 Golfview Drive #209, Troy, MI, 48084, United States, don.jones@gm.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: DIRECT is a low-dimensional global optimization algorithm that does not require derivatives and, most importantly, has no tuning parameters controlling the balance between local and global search.  These features make it quite robust. Previously versions of DIRECT handled simple bound constraints, nonlinear inequality constraints, and integrality constraints (integer variables).  This talk explains how DIRECT can be further extended to handle strict nonlinear equality constraints.</br>
