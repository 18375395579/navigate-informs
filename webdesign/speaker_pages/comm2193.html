We develop two tractable computational approaches to derive approximate stochastic trading strategies in the presence of temporary and permanent price impacts, possibly several constraints, and under a downside risk measure particularly VaR or CVaR. We compare performance of these approaches and discuss structure of computed trading strategies and their costs.</br>
