<br>Title: Dynamic Reserve Site Selection Under Contagion Risk of Deforestation</br><br>Author: Daniel Spring, Research Fellow, Monash University, School of Biological Sciences, PO Box 18, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia, Daniel.Spring@sci.monash.edu.au</br><br>Coauthor(s): Regis Sabbadin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Land development often takes the form of a contagion process in which sites most likely to be developed are near sites already developed. To consider nature reserve site selections in such cases, we propose an algorithm that uses a graph representation of the sites network and parameterised reinforcement learning to consider dynamic selection problems involving many sites. The method outperforms previously proposed heuristics in terms of the average number of species conserved.</br>
