Title: A Method for Improving the Dose Distribution Quality of Multi-criteria Radiation Therapy Plans<br>Author: Rasmus Bokrantz, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SE-100 44, Stockholm, Sweden, bokrantz@kth.se<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This talk considers an approach to radiation therapy planning where possible treatment options are explored through realtime interpolation over precomputed solutions.  A method is presented that improves the quality of interpolated solutions by minimizing a projective distance to the nondominated frontier under constraints on maintained dose distribution quality. Also, minimization of dose changes during conversion into deliverable machine settings are discussed in view of the presented method.
