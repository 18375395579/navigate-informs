Title: A Python Environment for Nonlinear Programming<br>Author: Dominique Orban, Professor, Ecole Polytechnique de Montréal, Math & Industrial Eng Department, 2900 Boulevard Edouard Montpetit, Montréal, H3T 1J4, Canada, dominique.orban@polymtl.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Friedlander<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: NLPy is an environment that eases development of numerical methods for linear  and nonlinear programming. The far reaches of object-oriented programming and  the power of the Python language promote reusability, readability and  rapid development without sacrificing numerical efficiency. NLPy provides the  building blocks on which optimization methods are built. We illustrate the  implementation of some well-known and novel algorithms routinely used in  optimization and their performance.
