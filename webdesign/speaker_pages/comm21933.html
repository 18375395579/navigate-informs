The far reaches of object-oriented programming and  the power of the Python language promote reusability, readability and  rapid development without sacrificing numerical efficiency. NLPy provides the  building blocks on which optimization methods are built. We illustrate the  implementation of some well-known and novel algorithms routinely used in  optimization and their performance.</br>
