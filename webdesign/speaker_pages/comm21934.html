Title: Maximizing the Efficiency of the U.S. Liver Allocation System through Region Design<br>Author: Nan Kong, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, kong@eng.usf.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Allocating organs for transplantation has been a contentious issue in the U.S. for decades. One of the remaining central questions is how to facilitate regional distribution of organ procurement organizations. We formulate this problem as a large-scale set-partitioning problem to find the most efficient set of regions. We also design a branch-and-price algorithm for the problem, in which we apply a decomposition-based heuristic and several valid inequalities to algorithm effectiveness.
