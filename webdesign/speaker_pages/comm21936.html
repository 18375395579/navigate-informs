<br>Title: Solving Integrated Location, Routing and Scheduling Problems</br><br>Author: Zeliha Akca, Lehigh University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Bethlehem, PA, United States of America, zelihaakca@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs, Rosemary Berger</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We discuss solution methods for optimization models that integrate facility location, vehicle routing, and scheduling decisions. A two-phase branch, cut, and price algorithm for instances with capacitated facilities and capacity- and time-limited vehicle routes and schedules will be described. The talk will cover heuristics for determining initial upper bounds, methods for generating violated valid inequalities, and various heuristic and exact column-generation algorithms.</br>
