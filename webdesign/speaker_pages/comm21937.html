<br>Title: Computing Bounds and Solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem with Approximate Linear Programming</br><br>Author: Michael Poremba, Ph.D. Student, Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Ave, GER 240, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, poremba@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alejandro Toriello</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP) using approximate linear programming (ALP) to restrict the dynamic programming formulation. The second author has previously applied ALP to the TSP to obtain a nested family of polyhedral lower bounds. We discuss two computational methods for solving these formulations, constraint generation and a primal-dual procedure. We also present a price-directed tour generation algorithm that uses ALP solutions as approximate costs-to-go.</br>
