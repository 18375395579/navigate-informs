<br>Title: Dual-based Local Search for Deterministic, Stochastic, and Robust Variants of the ConFL Problem</br><br>Author: Gisela Bardossy, Assistant Professor of Operations Research, University of Baltimore, 1420 N. Charles Street, Baltimore, MD, 21201, United States of America, mgbardossy@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a family of network design problems that arise in settings ranging from telecommunications to data management. We investigate the use of heuristic search procedures coupled with lower bounding mechanisms to obtain high quality solutions for deterministic, stochastic and robust variants of these problems. We extend methods, such as sample average approximation for stochastic optimization and the Bertsimas and Sim approach for robust optimization with heuristics, and widen their usability.</br>
