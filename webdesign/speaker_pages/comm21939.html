Title: Structural and Parametric Optimization of Separation Networks<br>Author: Libin Zhang, University of Illinois at Chicago, 851 S.

MINLP formulations are a common method of representation for the problems. We propose a hybrid algorithm for the solution of this MINLP separation problem combining stochastic search techniques with deterministic method. The proposed approach builds and optimizes complex column network and operating conditions simultaneously.
