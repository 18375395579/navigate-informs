At the core of the algorithm is a reformulation approach inspired by the work of Sherali and Adams. Bound tightening and special branch rules are applied to improve the lower bound, while an upper bound is sought with an NLP solver.    The procedure is implemented as a specialized cut generator for the Bonmin MINLP solver, in the COIN-OR framework (www.coin-or.org). We present some preliminary results on real-world MINLP instances.</br>
