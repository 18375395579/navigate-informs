In such cases the pmf is itself a random vector with support in a convex polytope. Our approach uses a simulation procedure (JDSIM) that explores these polytopes and create a sampled collection of distributions. We show that JDSIM lead to solutions that in expectation provide better results than the traditional robust approach.</br>
