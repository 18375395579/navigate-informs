<br>Title: Detecting Nonrandom Structure in Noisy Networks</br><br>Author: Marcus  B. Perry, perry.marcus@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present a tractable hypothesis testing framework for detecting, characterizing and estimating edge-set structure and strengths between vertices in an undirected network.  It is assumed that the edge set is only observable through a noisy adjacency matrix.  Application of the proposed method can provide analysts with valuable insight into the true edge structure with a given level of confidence. The proposed method is demonstrated using a real-world terrorist friendship network.</br>
