Cass Avenue, Argonne, Il, 60439, United States of America, petra@mcs.anl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mihai Anitescu, Miles Lubin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a scalable framework for solving stochastic programming problems, with application to the optimization of power grid energy systems with uncertain supply and demand. Our framework, PIPS, has parallel capabilities for both continuous and discrete stochastic optimizations problems. We will also discuss the computational results obtained on Intrepid Blue Gene/P system at Argonne when solving unit commitment problems with billions of variables.</br>
