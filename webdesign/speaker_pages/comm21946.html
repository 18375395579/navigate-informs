<br>Title: A Robust Approach to Intensity Modulated Proton (not Photon) Therapy under Range Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Timothy Chan, McKinsey and Company, 30 E Huron St. Apt 4609, Chicago, IL, United States of America, tcychan@alum.mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Bortfeld, John Tsitsiklis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Unlike traditional photon-based radiation therapy treatments, proton-based treatments are witness to significant uncertainty in the location of maximum dose deposition by the beamlets of radiation. In this talk, we present a robust formulation to optimize intensity-modulated proton therapy treatments.  We demonstrate that optimal robust solutions use specific physical characteristics of the proton beam to create dose distributions that are far less sensistive to the underlying uncertainty.</br>
