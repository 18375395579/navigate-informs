Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States, dan.zhang@ChicagoGSB.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Adelman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a network revenue management problem where customers choose among open fare products according to some pre-specified choice model. We approximate the dynamic programming value function with an affine function of the state vector, and show how to solve the resulting linear program using column generation.</br>
