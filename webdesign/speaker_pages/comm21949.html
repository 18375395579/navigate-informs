An algorithm is proposed to specify solution procedure, solution space of coalitions?optimization problems, dependence of coalition value on outside decisions, and effective coalition structure. Applications include the knapsack problem, facility location, capacity allocation, the k-median problem, and flowshop sequencing.</br>
