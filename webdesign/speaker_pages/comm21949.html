Title: Approximate Characteristic Functions for Intractable Cooperative Games in Operations Planning<br>Author: Zhixin Liu, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan - Dearborn, 19000 Hubbard Drive, Dearorn, MI, 48126-4100, United States of America, zhixin@umd.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Hall<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We design approximate characteristic functions for intractable operations planning games. An algorithm is proposed to specify solution procedure, solution space of coalitions?optimization problems, dependence of coalition value on outside decisions, and effective coalition structure. Applications include the knapsack problem, facility location, capacity allocation, the k-median problem, and flowshop sequencing.
