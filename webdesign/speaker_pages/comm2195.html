<br>Title: Parameter Tuning and Adaptive Techniques in SeDuMi</br><br>Author: Imre Pólik, PhD Student, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street W., Department of Mathematics, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4K1, Canada, poliki@mcmaster.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tamás Terlaky</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Most optimization solvers use a set of default parameters. While these values are rarely optimal, most users can not change them. In this talk we present some techniques to remedy this situation. Both offline and online solutions are discussed, involving optimization and learning techniques. The methods will be illustrated with the SeDuMi package.</br>
