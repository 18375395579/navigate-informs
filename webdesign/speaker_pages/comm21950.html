Title: Consensus Unsupervised Learning for Biomedical Networks<br>Author: Petros Xanthopoulos, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States of America, petrosx@ucf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Siavash Haghtalab<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Network clustering is an important task for many biomedical applications. Unfortunately clustering results may differ significantly for each algorithm. Many times locally optimal algorithms such as kmeans is possible to produce totally different results for different runs. In this works we propose a robust unsupervised learning framework for dealing with these inconsistencies.  Our approach is compared with individual clustering algorithms as well as other ensemble unsupervised learning methods.
