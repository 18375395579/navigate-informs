<br>Title: Demand-response in the Smart Grid: A Data-driven Pricing and Inventory Optimization Approach</br><br>Author: Pavithra Harsha, Research Staff Member, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, 34-225, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, pharsha@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dharmashankar Subramanian, Ramesh Natarajan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Demand response schemes based on dynamic pricing are of considerable interest in the emerging smart grid. We formulate the demand management problem as a price-sensitive newsvendor and present a novel data-driven, distribution-free approach that is based on the use of quantile and mixed quantile regression to jointly estimate the optimal generation level and pricing signals in the presence of multiple drivers of demand. We illustrate the efficacy, robustness and accuracy over alternate methods.</br>
