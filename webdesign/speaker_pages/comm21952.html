However, warehousing decisions are often not incorporated when developing distribution plans in practice. We develop a two-stage stochastic integer quadratically-constrained program for the problem of integrated warehouse-inventory-transportation planning under uncertainty. We apply a scenario decomposition approach and report preliminary computational findings.</br>
