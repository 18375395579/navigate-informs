<br>Title: Disjunctive Cutting Planes for Linear Complementarity Constraints</br><br>Author: Trang Nguyen, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, trang@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard, Mohit Tawarmalani</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We discuss the problem of generating strong cutting planes for linear programs with linear complementarity constraints (LPCCs). In particular, we exploit complementarity constraints to derive cuts from the optimal simplex tableaux of the LP relaxation of the problem. We also introduce the notions of split cut and split closure for LPCC problems with bounded variables. We compare these notions with their integer programming counterpart and present preliminary numerical results.</br>
