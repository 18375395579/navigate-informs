Title: Approximation Algorithms for k-Hurdle Problems<br>Author: Brian Dean, Clemson University, bcdean@cs.clemson.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The k-hurdle problem is a natural generalization of the classical s-t minimum cut problem where we must select a minimum-cost subset S of the edges of a graph such that every s-t path intersects S at least k times.  In this talk we describe a set of approximation algorithms for k-hurdle variants of the NP-hard multiway cut and multicut problems.  For the k-hurdle multiway cut problem with r terminals, we give two results, the first being a pseudo-approximation algorithm that outputs a (k-1)-hurdle solution whose cost is at most that of an optimal solution for k hurdles.  The second is a 2(1-1/r)-approximation algorithm based on rounding the solution of a linear program that embeds our graph into a simplex.  For the k-hurdle multicut problem in an n-vertex graph, we provide an algorithm that, for any constant epsilon > 0, outputs a (1-epsilon)k-hurdle solution of cost at most O(log n) times that of an optimal k-hurdle solution, and we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm for trees.
