We develop a finitely convergent decomposition scheme utilizing Gomory cuts to obtain iteratively tighter approximations of the second stage integer programs. We present computational experiments that illustrate the use of these cuts both within a pure cutting plane, as well as a branch-and-cut based decomposition algorithm.</br>
