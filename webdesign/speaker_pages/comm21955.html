Title: Computations with Decomposition Algorithms using Gomory Cuts for 2-Stage Stochastic IPs<br>Author: Dinakar Gade, Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, United States of America, gade.6@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Simge Kucukyavuz, Suvrajeet Sen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a class of two-stage stochastic integer programs with binary variables in the first stage and general integer variables in the second stage. We develop a finitely convergent decomposition scheme utilizing Gomory cuts to obtain iteratively tighter approximations of the second stage integer programs. We present computational experiments that illustrate the use of these cuts both within a pure cutting plane, as well as a branch-and-cut based decomposition algorithm.
