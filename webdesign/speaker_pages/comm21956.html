Title: Multi-objective Approaches for Robust Airline Scheduling<br>Author: Geert De Maere, Research Assistant, School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Wollaton Road, Nottingham, NG81BB, United Kingdom, gdm@cs.nott.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Edmund Burke, Patrick De Causmaecker<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a flight re-timing and an integrated flight re-timing and re-routing approach for multi-objective improvement of robustness objectives (ROBs) in airline schedules. The approaches are applied on real world data to investigate interaction between ROBs. Their simultaneous influence is quantified in a large scale simulation study, providing new insights in robustness of airline schedules. We illustrate high performance of our metaheuristic search through comparison with exact methods.
