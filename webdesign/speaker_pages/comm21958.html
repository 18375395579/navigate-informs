<br>Title: Valid Inequalities and Formulations for a Dynamic Optimization Problem under a Chance Constraint</br><br>Author: Minjiao Zhang, Graduate Research Associate, The Ohio State University, Integrated Systems Engineering, 1971 Neil Ave., Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, zhang.769@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Simge Kucukyavuz</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a dynamic decision-making problem under uncertainty with a service level constraint. We formulate this problem as a joint chance-constrained program, and propose a branch-and-cut algorithm utilizing its cardinality-constrained continuous mixing substructure. We also compare the joint chance-constrained model with a risk-averse model and a robust optimization model on a dynamic probabilistic lot-sizing problem.</br>
