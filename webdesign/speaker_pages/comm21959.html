<br>Title: Robustifying Convex Risk Measures: A Non-Parametric Approach</br><br>Author: David Wozabal, Technische Universität München, TUM School of Management, Arcisstr. 21, München, 80333, Germany, david.wozabal@tum.de</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We robustify convex, version independent risk measures. The robustified measures are defined as the worst case portfolio risk over a neighborhood of a reference distribution. The problem of finding the worst case risk is solved analytically and closed form expressions for the robust risk measures are obtained. Using these results robustified versions for several examples of risk measures are derived and the resulting robust risk measures are tested in rolling-window out-of-sample evaluations.</br>
