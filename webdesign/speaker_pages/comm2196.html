<br>Title: Multiplicative Epsilon-Dominance in Multiobjective Programming</br><br>Author: Lakmali Weerasena, PhD Student, Clemson University, O-110, Martin Hall, Box 340975, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, lweeras@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Margaret Wiecek</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Multiplicative epsilon-dominance is studied as a binary relation that yields the epsilon-Pareto set being an approximation of the Pareto set for multiobjective programs (MOPs). The effect of generalizing the Pareto cone to polyhedral or more general convex cones in order to obtain approximations of nondominated sets of MOPs is examined.</br>
