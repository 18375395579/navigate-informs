<br>Title: Network Optimization and Beyond in SAS/OR?Software</br><br>Author: Leo Lopes, Advanced Analytics Specialist, SAS Institute, SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC, 27513, United States of America, Leo.Lopes@sas.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This talk demonstrates new features in the OPTMODEL procedure for network and combinatorial optimization. With PROC OPTMODEL, you can access a variety of network-based solvers by using only problem definitions instead of explicit formulations, greatly enhancing performance and scalability. You can also access most of the functionality of the SAS System by merging invocations of other SAS procedures with mathematical programming constructs that are built into the PROC OPTMODEL modeling language.</br>
