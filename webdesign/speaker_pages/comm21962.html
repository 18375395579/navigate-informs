Title: A Computational Comparison of SDP-based Methods for QCQPs<br>Author: Jitamitra Desai, Assistant Professor, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, Singapore, jdesai@ntu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Rupaj Kumar Nayak<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: There are several well-known convexification methods for solving nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs). We introduce a new class of valid cutting planes based on SDP constructs that tighten convex relaxations of QCQPs. A further improvement by using a modified version of the triangle inequalities is also presented. Computational comparison across different types of relaxations shows the efficacy of these new cutting plane strategies.
