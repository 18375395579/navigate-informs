Title: Methods of Reducing Optimization of Omega Function to Linear Programming<br>Author: Sergey Sarykalin, PhD Student, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, saryk@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stan Uryasev<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing the Omega Function of a portfolio with a fixed benchmark. We propose two theorems reducing the original problem to the two relaxed problems without a restriction that the decision variables should sum up to 1. When the Omega function at optimality is greater than 1, both relaxed problem can be reduced to linear programming. We illustrate the proposed methodology with the case study on allocating recourses among managers in a hedge fund.
