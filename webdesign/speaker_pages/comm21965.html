First we show a well-known result that the diameter of any 0-1 polytope is bounded by its dimension by a simple argument using the simplex method.   Next we show that the upper bound obtained by the authors for the number of distinct solutions generated by the simplex method is tight by constructing an LP instance on a 0-1 polytope.</br>
