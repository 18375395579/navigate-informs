Input to our procedures is a sequence of solutions with at least one optimal limit point. We use increasing sample sizes to assess the quality of the solutions and provide stopping rules. Our first method increases the sample size one by one. An accelerated method increases it in jumps using the current information. We discuss asymptotic properties and present preliminary computational results.</br>
