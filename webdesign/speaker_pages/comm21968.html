<br>Title: Nonlinear Parameter Estimation in Parallel Using Progressive Hedging</br><br>Author: Carl Laird, Professor, Texas A&M University, 3122 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, Carl.Laird@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Word, Jean-Paul Watson, David Woodruff</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Nonlinear programming has proven an effective tool for tackling many real-world problems. However, as problem size continues to grow, solution approaches utilizing parallel computing are necessary. Noting the equivalency between parameter estimation problems and stochastic nonlinear programming, here we use a parallel progressive hedging algorithm to efficiently estimate parameters in a large-scale nonlinear infectious disease model using the PySP stochastic programming package from Pyomo.</br>
