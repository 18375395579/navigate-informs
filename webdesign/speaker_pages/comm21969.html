Title: Models and Algorithms for Stackelberg Games with Incomplete Information<br>Author: Fernando Ordonez, Associate Professor, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Ave, GER 240, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, fordon@usc.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Stackelberg games, where one player, the leader, selects its action  first and the second player decides its optimal strategy knowing the actions of the leader is a natural problem for various security domains.  This framework however assumes the leader has an accurate model of the  adversary.  We present efficient mixed-integer programs and algorithms to solve problems with imperfect information about the adversary, its reward structure, or decision process.
