Each buyer asks for a bundle of various commodities, and each seller provides multiple units of one commodity. We implement a novel padding technique to design the truthful double auction mechanisms under the multi-stage design approach. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first strategy-proof, individually rational, budget-balanced mechanisms for the specified exchange environment.</br>
