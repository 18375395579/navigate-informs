Title: Multi-commodity Network Flow Problems with Substitution<br>Author: Guvenc Sahin, Associate Professor, Sabanci University, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, 34956, Turkey, guvencs@sabanciuniv.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ekin Koker<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Multi-commodity network flow problem generalizes the single commodity problem. Integrality conditions together with arc capacities make the problem NP-complete. A new variant of the multi-commodity problem includes substitution possibilities amongst commodities. We investigate capacitated and uncapacitated versions for their unimodularity properties and computational complexities. We also present a computational study to empirically observe what makes the problems harder to solve.
