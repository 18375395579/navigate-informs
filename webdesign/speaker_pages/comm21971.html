<br>Title: A Direct CVaR Approach with a Detailed Representation of Critical Scenarios for the SDDP Method Applied to Hydrothermal Generation Planning</br><br>Author: Débora D. J. Penna, Researcher, CEPEL - Brazilian Electric Energy Research Center, Avenida Horacio Macedo, 354, Ilha do Fundão - Cidade Universitária, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22941-911, Brazil, debora@cepel.br</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maria Elvira Maceira, Andre Luiz Diniz</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present an alternative CVaR approach for the stochastic dual dynamic programming approach, with no additional state variables and a more intuitive recourse function, as compared to previous works. Aiming to improve the risk measure, we also perform a detailed representation of the tail of the distribution function by employing multivariate statistical techniques. Numerical results and discussion are presented in the multi-stage generation planning problem of the large-scale Brazilian system.</br>
