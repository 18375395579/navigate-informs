Title: Price and Ore Uncertainty on the Ultimate Pit Problem<br>Author: Daniel Espinoza, Assistant Professor, University of Chile, Av. Republica 701, Santiago, 8370439, Chile, daespino@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Eduardo Moreno, Marcos Goycoolea<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we will present ongoing research on stochastic or uncertain open pit planning, either on ore-grade estimation, or in price. We compare several standard risk models (VaR, CVaR and others) by using either the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) technique, and robust counterparts of some simple formulations.  We will focus on the strengths and drawbacks of the proposed techniques, and intensive computational experiments for the analysis.
