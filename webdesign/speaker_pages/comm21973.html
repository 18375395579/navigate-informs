<br>Title: Robust SAA</br><br>Author: Nathan Kallus, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, kallus@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas, Vishal Gupta</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The sample average approximation (SAA) approach to data-driven optimization generally enjoys convergence as the sample size grows infinitely, but lacks finite-sample performance guarantees that apply as generally. We present a robustification of the SAA using tools of statistical testing, gaining generic probabilistic guarantees without losing SAA's wide-applicability, convergence, and tractability. The convergence of guarantees suggests that they are not overly conservative.</br>
