Title: Fenchel Decomposition for Stochastic Integer Programs with Special Structure<br>Author: Saravanan Venkatachalam, PhD Candidate, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering Dept, College Station, TX, United States of America, saravanan@entc.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eric Beier, Luca Corolli, Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We implement and perform a computational study of a Fenchel decomposition algorithm for two stage stochastic 0-1 integer programs with special structure. The algorithm involves generating Fenchel cuts in a scenario-wise decomposition setting and techniques for upper bounding for faster convergence of the algorithm. Computational results using large scale test instances will be presented.
