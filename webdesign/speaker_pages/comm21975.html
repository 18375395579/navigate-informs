In the literature attempts have been made to integrate different stages of these planning problems. We address the integrated fleet assignment and crew pairing problem based on representative data of a European Airline. This problem has its specific properties (e.g. fixed crew salaries, single base, properties of flight schedule).  We develop heuristic based novel solution methods.
