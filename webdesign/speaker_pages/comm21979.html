Title: Blind Sequential Identification of Manufacturing Variation Sources<br>Author: Dan Apley, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, IE/MS, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, apley@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuemei Shan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Blind source separation is a new tool for identifying and eliminating major sources of variation in multivariate manufacturing processes. One recent algorithm combines different separation criteria to minimize mean square error. We propose a sequential method for separating the sources that achieves better estimation accuracy than the optimal all-at-once approach.
