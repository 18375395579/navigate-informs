Title: Branching Objects in the CPLEX MIP Optimizer<br>Author: Ed Klotz, Mathematical Programming Specialist, IBM, 926 Incline Way, Suite 100, Incline Village, NV, 89451, United States of America, klotz@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: While usually described in terms of integer variables, the branch and bound algorithm can branch on other elements of a MIP as well.  This presentation will consider the strengths and weaknesses of additional branching objects supported by IBM's CPLEX optimizer, including special ordered sets, indicator constraints and general disjunctions.  It will then examine some models where general disjunctions dramatically improve performance compared to branching on integer variables.
