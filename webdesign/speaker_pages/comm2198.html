This presentation will consider the strengths and weaknesses of additional branching objects supported by IBM's CPLEX optimizer, including special ordered sets, indicator constraints and general disjunctions.  It will then examine some models where general disjunctions dramatically improve performance compared to branching on integer variables.</br>
