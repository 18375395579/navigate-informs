<br>Title: Parallel Risk Averse Computational Stochastic Programming: Storage Operation Case</br><br>Author: Somayeh Moazeni, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, United States of America, somayeh@Princeton.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell, Belgacem Bouzaiene-Ayari</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we present a novel risk averse computational stochastic programming approach, called SMART-PPS, for multi-stage finite horizon optimization problems under stochastic uncertainty and risk. The methodology relies on policy search, spline approximation, and a direct search  framework. We describe a parallel implementation of this approach using a nested parallel model. The tractability and performance of the methodology are discussed for an energy storage optimal operation problem.</br>
