The method uses an adaptive control discretization approach to deal with the time-varying optimization variables. In order to find convergent bounds on the control discretization errors we develop an ellipsoidal set-propagation technique which is inspired from the fields of reachability analysis and robust control. We illustrate the advantages of this direct method with numerical examples.</br>
