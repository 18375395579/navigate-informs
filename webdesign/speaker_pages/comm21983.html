Title: A Direct Method for Deterministic Global Optimization of Nonlinear Optimal Control Problems<br>Author: Boris Houska, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus, London, United Kingdom, b.houska@imperial.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Benoit Chachuat<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a tailored direct method for solving optimal control problems to global optimality. The method uses an adaptive control discretization approach to deal with the time-varying optimization variables. In order to find convergent bounds on the control discretization errors we develop an ellipsoidal set-propagation technique which is inspired from the fields of reachability analysis and robust control. We illustrate the advantages of this direct method with numerical examples.
