Title: Information-relaxation based Value and Policy Iterations for Stochastic Control Problems<br>Author: Nan Chen, Associate Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 709A William Mong Engineering Building, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Yu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop an iterative approach to solve stochastic control problems based on the information relaxation technique. Upper and lower bounds for the value function are computed in each iteration. Both the bounds converge to the optimal value in finite steps of iterations.
