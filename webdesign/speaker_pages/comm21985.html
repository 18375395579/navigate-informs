Title: Truthful and Near-Optimal Mechanism Design via Linear Programming<br>Author: Chaitanya Swamy, Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo, Dept. of C&O, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, cswamy@math.uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Ron Lavi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of designing efficient truthful mechanisms that compute near-optimal solutions to the social-welfare-maximization algorithmic problem. We show that for packing problems (e.g., combinatorial auctions), any c-approximation algorithm that also bounds the integrality gap of the LP relaxation of the problem by c can be used to construct a c-approximation, truthful-in-expectation mechanism. This yields a variety of new and significantly improved results.
