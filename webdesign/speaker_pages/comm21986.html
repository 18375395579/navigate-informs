Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming for Dynamic Ambulance Deployment<br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Cornell University, Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States, ht88@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shane Henderson, Mateo Restrepo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present algorithms for repositioning ambulances in an emergency medical service system. Our approach is based on approximating the value functions in the dynamic programming formulation of the problem, and using simulation- and regression-based techniques to fine-tune the approximations.
