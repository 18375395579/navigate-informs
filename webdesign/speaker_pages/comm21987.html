Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1318, United States, rdcarr@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Phillips</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a new algorithm for finding a feasible solution for a integer program that is well suited for parallel implementation. The algorithm runs in time polynomial in the input size and is guaranteed to find a feasible integer solution for any problem class that has a finite integrality gap.  The algorithm is based on convex decomposition of scaled linear-programming relaxations, so in general it provides a suite of integer solutions.  A faster heuristic gives only one feasible solution.</br>
