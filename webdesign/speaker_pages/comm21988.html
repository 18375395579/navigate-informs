Title: The Trust Region Subproblem with Non-Intersecting Linear Constraints<br>Author: Sam Burer, Professor, University of Iowa, S346 Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, United States of America, samuel-burer@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Boshi Yang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study an extended trust region subproblem in which the trust region  intersects the unit ball with m linear inequality constraints. We show  that a certain convex relaxation exhibits no gap as long as the linear  constraints are non-intersecting in the unit ball.
