We first consider a problem with a single chance constraint, show that only finite risk thresholds affect optimum, and interpret the risk tolerance as SOS1 binary variables. We then optimize risk variables in multiple joint chance constraints. Our computations demonstrate that an enumeration takes longer CPU time than the MIP reformulation with SOS1 constraints.</br>
