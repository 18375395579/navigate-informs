Title: Risk Optimization in Probabilistic Programs with Single or Multiple Chance Constraints<br>Author: Siqian Shen, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 2793 IOE Building, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48103, United States of America, siqian@umich.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper considers discretely distributed CCP, and trades off risk and cost by treating risk tolerances as decision variables. We first consider a problem with a single chance constraint, show that only finite risk thresholds affect optimum, and interpret the risk tolerance as SOS1 binary variables. We then optimize risk variables in multiple joint chance constraints. Our computations demonstrate that an enumeration takes longer CPU time than the MIP reformulation with SOS1 constraints.
