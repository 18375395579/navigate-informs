Title: Constraint Programming and B&P for a Joint Depot Location, Fleet Design and Routing Problem<br>Author: Jaime Miranda, Universidad Diego Portales, Ejercito Libertador 441, Santiago, Chile, jaime.miranda@udp.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Cristian Cortes, Sebastian Souyris, Pablo Rey, Jose Robles<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper we propose a Branch and Price scheme to solve a joint depot location, fleet design and routing problem, required for the application of the standarized evaluation exam SIMCE over all schools located in Santiago-Chile. This exam is conducted every year by the Ministry of Education. The master problem is an extension of a standard VRP, while the resulting subproblem is solved with Constraint Programming. Promisory preliminary results have been obtained so far.
