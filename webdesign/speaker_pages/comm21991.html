Title: It's a Small World If You Hit-and-Run<br>Author: Archis Ghate, University of Michigan, IOE Department, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, archis@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Smith<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Hit-and-Run is a well-known algorithm for sampling from essentially arbitrary distributions over bounded regions of Rn. We show how a special case of Hit-and-Run generates a Small World network on the fly. This network admits efficient search by a decentralized algorithm. We investigate its implications for global optimization.
