Barton</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose an investment problem modeled as a stochastic program with decision dependent probabilities. We assume there is an activity or technology available that will alter the probabilities of the discrete scenarios occuring. By investing in such technology or activity, it is possible to increase the probability of some scenarios, while reducing the probability of the remaining scenarios. We demonstrate the use of a specialized decomposition algorithm for this class of problems.</br>
