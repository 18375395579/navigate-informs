<br>Title: Mixed-Integer Programming Techniques for Decomposing IMRT Fluence Maps Using Rectangular Apertures</br><br>Author: Zeki Caner Taskin, PhD Candidate, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, taskin@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith, Edwin Romeijn</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a matrix decomposition problem arising in IMRT, in which a matrix of intensity values is to be delivered to a patient from a given angle, under the condition that the IMRT device can only deliver radiation in rectangular shapes. We study the problem of minimizing the number of rectangles necessary to decompose such a matrix. We propose an integer programming-based methodology for providing bounds on the optimal solution, and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on clinical data.</br>
