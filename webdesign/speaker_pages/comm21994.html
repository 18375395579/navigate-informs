<br>Title: A Robust Algorithm for Planning Ground Delay Programs Under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Avijit Mukherjee, University of California, avijit@ucsc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Hoffman, Michael Ball</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A new algorithm, which considers both equity and efficiency goals, for planning ground delay programs under uncertainty is presented. Experimental results with realistic flight schedules and airport capacity indicates that the algorithm produces an efficient frontier of solutions compared to a distance-based flight exemption policy, which is a standard practice.</br>
