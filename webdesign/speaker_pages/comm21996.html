Title: Provisioning for Large Scale Loss Network Systems with Application in Cloud Computing<br>Author: Yue Tan, The Ohio State University, 210 Baker Systems Bldg., 1971 Neil Ave., Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, tan.268@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yingdong Lu, Cathy Xia<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a stochastic modeling approach to guide the resource provisioning task for future service clouds as the demand grows large. This problem can be mapped to a capacity planning problem in a general multi-class Erlang loss network model under quality of service constraint. We give an improved optimization formulation that is not only easier to solve, but also yields asymptotically exact provisioning solutions with improved QoS guarantees.
