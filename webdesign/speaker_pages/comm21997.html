Title: Revisiting the Constraint Activating Outer Polar Method<br>Author: Samid Hoda, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, shoda@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Egon Balas, Francois Margot<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine the performance of the Constraint Activating Outer Polar Method (CAOPM) on a small testbed of 0-1 programs. The CAOPM is a method for solving 0-1 programs that starts with a subset of the problem constraints that defines a bounded relaxation of the feasible region. It then adds only as many of the remaining problem constraints as are needed to find a relaxation that lies within the outer polar of the integer hull. The best feasible solution found is an optimal solution to the problem.
