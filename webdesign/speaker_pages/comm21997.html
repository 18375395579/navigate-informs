The CAOPM is a method for solving 0-1 programs that starts with a subset of the problem constraints that defines a bounded relaxation of the feasible region. It then adds only as many of the remaining problem constraints as are needed to find a relaxation that lies within the outer polar of the integer hull. The best feasible solution found is an optimal solution to the problem.</br>
