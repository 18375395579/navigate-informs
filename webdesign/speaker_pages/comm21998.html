We detail some primal heuristics, a column generation technique, several classes of cuts, and a preprocessing step.  We will present results of some computational experiments with these techniques.  Some of these techniques are problem-specific, but we will indicate generalisations to a class of bilinear MIPs where appropriate.</br>
