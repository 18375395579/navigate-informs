Title: MIP Techniques for Product Pricing under a Reservation Price Model<br>Author: Tor Myklebust, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. W., Waterloo, ON, N2L 6S7, Canada, tmyklebu@csclub.uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Levent Tuncel, Malcolm Sharpe<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We discuss techniques for solving instances of a certain product pricing  problem based on reservation prices.  We detail some primal heuristics, a column generation technique, several classes of cuts, and a preprocessing step.  We will present results of some computational experiments with these techniques.  Some of these techniques are problem-specific, but we will indicate generalisations to a class of bilinear MIPs where appropriate.
