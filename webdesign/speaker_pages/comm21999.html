Title: Strategies for Solving Stochastic Call Center Scheduling Models Using Excel<br>Author: Thomas Robbins, Assistant Professor, East Carolina University, 3212 Bate Building, Greenville, NC, 27858, United States of America, robbinst@ecu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Call center scheduling models are in general quite computationally intensive.  Stochastic programming formulations are even more intensive.  In this talk we examine the feasibility of solving these models in what is often the supervisor’s tool of choice?Excel.  We present a number of strategies for achieving quality results within the constraints of the Excel environment.
