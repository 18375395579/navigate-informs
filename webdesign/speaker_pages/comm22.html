Title: Integrated Queuing and Gaming Analsis of Stochastic Assembly Systems<br>Author: Ananth Krishnamurthy, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, CII 5015, 110 8th Street, Troy, NY, United States, krisha@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jong-Shi Pang, Ram Ramakrishnan, Jinye Zhao<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic, decentralized assembly system  consisting of two suppliers and one assembler, who decide on  investments on capacities and inventories subject to a common  throughput constraint.  Queuing approximations for the relevant  performance measures are integrated into the players' optimization problems, resulting in a generalized Nash equilibrium problem. Existence of a solution is established and numerical results  are presented.
