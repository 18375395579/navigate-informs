Title: Adaptive Dynamic Programming to Control the Environmental Impact of Airport Deicing<br>Author: Zirun Zhang, The University of Texas at Arlington, Dept. of Indus. & Manufac. Sys. Engr., Arlington, TX, 76011, United States of America, zirun.zhang@mavs.uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger, Victoria C Chen, Dan Bergman, Li Zeng<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach for assigning aircrafts to deicing pad locations at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport is developed to minimize the impact on dissolved oxygen (DO) in receiving waters. In this stochastic, finite-horizon, non-stationary, non-convex, and very high dimensional ADP problem, future value functions are statistically modeled and a mixed integer linear programming problem is formulated within each stage to maintain DO in current and future stages.
