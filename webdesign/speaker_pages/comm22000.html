<br>Title: Optimization of Wind, Diesel and Battery Systems for Remote Areas</br><br>Author: Miguel F. Anjos, Canada Research Chair, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, C.P. 6079, Succ. Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC, H3C 3A7, Canada, miguel-f.anjos@polymtl.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thibault Barbier, Gilles Savard</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Hybrid energy systems are often designed using simulation-based tools in which the dispatch rules are set a priori by the decision-makers. This choice of rule influences the results obtained and may be sub-optimal. We present an integer linear optimization model for the problem of finding the optimal design and dispatch scenario without using dispatch rules. The corresponding implementable rules are then extracted from these results.</br>
