Title: Symmetry Compatible Formulations Via Objective Perturbations and Hierarchical Constraints<br>Author: Ahmed Ghoniem, Virginia Tech, Durham 250 (0118), Blacksburg, VA, 24060, United States of America, aghoniem@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hanif Sherali<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss how hierarchical constraints can be combined with objective  perturbations in a nonpreemptive multiobjective framework in order to defeat symmetry in combinatorial optimization problems. We also present the concept of symmetry compatible formulations and its relationship with these two symmetry-defeating paradigms. Computations for selected applications are presented.
