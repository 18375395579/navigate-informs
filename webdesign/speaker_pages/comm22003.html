Title: New Developments for Solving MINLPs with AIMMS<br>Author: Ximena Cerda, AIMMS Specialist, Paragon Decision Technology Inc., 5400 Carillon Point, Kirkland, WA, 98033, United States of America, Ximena.Cerda@aimms.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: AIMMS has been extended with KNITRO’s brand new MINLP version. Up till now, MINLP could be solved using the (open and customizable) AIMMS Outer Approximation (AOA) algorithm or BARON. Adding KNITRO’s MINLP version gives the AIMMS user more choice and flexibility in solving this difficult class of problems. We will demonstrate how to use KNITRO in AIMMS and do a comparison of AOA and KNITRO on real-life applications.   For more information about AIMMS, AOA and KNITRO, see www.AIMMS.com.
