Title: Large-Scale Nonlinear Parameter Estimation with IPOPT<br>Author: Victor M. Zavala, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, vzavala@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lorenz Biegler<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Previously intractable DAE-constrained estimation problems for complex process models have been considered. Although the related NLPs are highly nonlinear with possibly non-unique solutions, IPOPT has shown to be efficient in their solution. NLPs with up to 69,000 constraints and 530 degrees of freedom have been solved in a few minutes.
