<br>Title: A Linear Programming Approach to Some Impulse Control Problems</br><br>Author: Chao Zhu, Associate Professor, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States of America, zhu@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Stockbridge, Kurt Helmes</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider stochastic impulse control problems and their applications in finance and inventory control. Both long term average and discounted cost criteria are examined. The analysis imbed the impulse control problems in infinite-dimensional linear programs over spaces of occupation measures and then analyze auxiliary problems having fewer constraints. In this manner upper bounds are determined for the optimal value; which in turn lead to the value functions and optimal control policies.</br>
