Given an integer matrix W with n columns and d rows, a convex function f over R^d and a polyhedron P in R^n, we would like to minimize f(Wx) subject to x in P, integer.    Assuming d to be fixed, and W to be given in unary representation, we study classes of polyhedra P, for which the latter problem can be solved in polynomial time.</br>
