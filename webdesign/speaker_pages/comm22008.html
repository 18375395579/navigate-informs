Title: Optimal Sequential Exploration: Bandits, Clairvoyants and Wildcats<br>Author: David Brown, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, United States of America, dbbrown@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jim Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially exploring a large oil field. The problem resembles a classical bandit problem, but is complicated by dependence: results for one target provide information about neighboring targets. We develop heuristic policies by grouping targets into clusters that are assumed to be independent. We also show how to compute upper bounds using information relaxations and results for bandit superprocesses. In our examples, these heuristic policies are nearly optimal.
