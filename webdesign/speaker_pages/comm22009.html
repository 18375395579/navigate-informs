Title: A Cost-minimizing Heuristic Solution Algorithm for the Network Sensor Location Problem<br>Author: Emanuel Seitinger, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, Austria, emanuelseitinger@aon.at<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The cost-effective and accurate estimation of traffic flows is of immense importance in traffic planning. We discuss one exact and one heuristic solution procedure for the network sensor location problem. While the exact solution procedure turns out to be unfeasible for many real-life applications, its modification that takes costs, assumptions on human behavior and turning proportions into account comes up with greatly improved results.
