Sherali<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: And the abstract is as follows: “We introduce a Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT)-based open-source optimization software for solving polynomial programs (RLT-POS). We start with presenting algorithms that form the backbone of RLT-POS. Next, we discuss the coordination between (a) bound-grid-factor constraints and semidefinite cuts and (b) constraint filtering techniques and reduced RLT representations. Finally, we compare the performances of the software packages BARON, SparsePOP, and Couenne with RLT-POS.
