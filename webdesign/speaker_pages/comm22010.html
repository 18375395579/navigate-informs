<br>Title: Term Structure Price Model for Non-storable Commodities</br><br>Author: Miha Troha, University of Oxford, Manor Road, Oxford, United Kingdom, troha@maths.ox.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Raphael Hauser</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we propose a term structure power price model that, in contrast to widely accepted no-arbitrage based approaches, accounts for non-storable nature of power. It belongs to a class of equilibrium game theoretic models. We start the paper by describing the problem and proving existence and uniqueness of its solution. We then propose an algorithm applicable for solving the problem and conclude with numerical results contrasted with the existing power price models.</br>
