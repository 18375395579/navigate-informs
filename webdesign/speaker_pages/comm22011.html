<br>Title: An Integer Programming Formulation to Generate Airline Crew Pairings</br><br>Author: Shervin AhmadBeygi, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, Shervin@umich.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present an Integer Programming formulation to generate crew pairings to solve the airline crew scheduling problem. We exploit the problem structure to use a parallel processing framework to improve the algorithm tractability. We also introduce the idea of â€œflight potentialsâ€?to restrict the problem size. Computational results based on a U.S. major airline show that this solution approach in conjunction with the existing crew pairing generators can be implemented to solve large problems.</br>
