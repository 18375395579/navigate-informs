Title: Distributed Block Coordinate Descent Method: Iteration Complexity and Efficient Hybrid Implementation<br>Author: Martin Takac, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH93JZ, United Kingdom, M.Takac@sms.ed.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Richtarik<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this work we propose solving huge-scale instances of regularized convex minimization problems using a distributed block coordinate descent method. We analyze the iteration complexity of the algorithm and show how it depends on the way the problem data is partitioned to the nodes. Several variations of the basic method are obtained based on the way updates are handled. We report encouraging numerical results for an efficient hybrid MPI + Open MP implementation applied to sparse SVM.
