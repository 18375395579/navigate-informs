Title: Closed-loop Supply Chain Design under Uncertainty<br>Author: Vedat Verter, Professor, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke St. W., Montreal, QC, H3A 1G5, Canada, vedat.verter@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Wenyi Chen, Beste Kucukyazici<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a mathematical formulation for designing a closed-loop supply chain under uncertainties with regards to demand, return rate and recovery rate. The model is applied in studying a realistic problem instance that involve the production and recycling of washers and tumble dryers in Germany.  We will presents the managerial insights derived from a large set of computational experiments.
