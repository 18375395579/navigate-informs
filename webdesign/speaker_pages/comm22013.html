<br>Title: Closed-loop Supply Chain Design under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Vedat Verter, Professor, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke St. W., Montreal, QC, H3A 1G5, Canada, vedat.verter@mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wenyi Chen, Beste Kucukyazici</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a mathematical formulation for designing a closed-loop supply chain under uncertainties with regards to demand, return rate and recovery rate. The model is applied in studying a realistic problem instance that involve the production and recycling of washers and tumble dryers in Germany.  We will presents the managerial insights derived from a large set of computational experiments.</br>
