Title: Failure-aware Kidney Exchange<br>Author: John Dickerson, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, United States of America, dickerson@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ariel Procaccia, Tuomas Sandholm<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Most algorithmic matches in fielded kidney exchanges do not result in an actual transplant. We address the problem of cycles and chains in a proposed match failing after the algorithm has committed to them. We show that failure-aware kidney exchange increases the expected number of lives saved in theory and in practice. We design a branch-and-price-based optimal clearing algorithm for this problem; this new solver scales well on large simulated data, unlike prior clearing algorithms.
