Title: An Affine-scaling Interior-point CBB Algorithm and its Applications<br>Author: Hongchao Zhang, IMA, University of Minnesota, 400 Lind Hall, 2007 Church Street S. E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, hozhang@ima.umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Hager<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present an affine-scaling CBB algorithm for box-constrained optimization which has the property that each iterate is a scaled cyclic Barzilai-Borwein (BB) gradient iterate that lies in the interior of the feasible set. Global convergence is established  for a nonmonotone line search and local R-linear convergence is  established under proper conditions. This algorithm has received successful applications in PET medical imaging and signal precessing in MIMO channels.
