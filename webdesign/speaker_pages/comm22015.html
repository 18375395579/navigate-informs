E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, hozhang@ima.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Hager</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present an affine-scaling CBB algorithm for box-constrained optimization which has the property that each iterate is a scaled cyclic Barzilai-Borwein (BB) gradient iterate that lies in the interior of the feasible set. Global convergence is established  for a nonmonotone line search and local R-linear convergence is  established under proper conditions. This algorithm has received successful applications in PET medical imaging and signal precessing in MIMO channels.</br>
