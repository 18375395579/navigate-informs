Title: Solution Approaches for the Cutting Stock Problem with Setup Cost<br>Author: Ali Ekici, University of Houston, Department of Industrial Engineering, Houston, TX, United States of America, aekici@central.uh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Azadeh Mobasher<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this research, we study the Cutting Stock Problem with Setup Cost (CSP-S). In CSP-S, unlike traditional Cutting Stock Problem (CSP), we have separate cost factors for the number of setups and material usage, and the objective is to minimize total production cost including both material and setup costs while satisfying demand. We propose two local search algorithms and a column generation algorithm, and test these algorithms on a set of instances from the literature.
