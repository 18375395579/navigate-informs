Title: Multi-Criteria Optimization of the Component-Based Software Systems<br>Author: Soundar R. T. Kumara, Distinguished Professor, The Pennsylvania State University, 363 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, skumara@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seokcheon Lee<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a software system whose behavior can be controlled by resource allocation and algorithm selection. A problem is decomposed into root tasks and those tasks are propagated through a task flow structure. The service provided is to produce a global solution, an aggregate of partial solutions. The QoS depends on the quality of solution and the time for generating the solution. We provide a methodology to identify the decision sets that give non-dominated quality of services.
