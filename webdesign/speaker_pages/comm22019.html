Title: Sparse Grid Interpolation in Linear Programming<br>Author: Emanuele Borgonovo, Professor, Bocconi University, Via Roentgen 1, Milan, Italy, emanuele.borgonovo@unibocconi.it<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Wendell, Greg Buzzard<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this work, we propose the utilization of sparse grid interpolation in linear programming. We show that this approach, when coupled with functional ANOVA, allows decision-makers to broaden the range of managerial insights obtained by sensitivity analysis. The connection with the tolerance sensitivity approach is discussed.
