Title: Grammar Constraints<br>Author: Meinolf Sellmann, Assistant Professor, Brown University, 115 Waterman Street, PO Box 1910, Providence, RI, 02912, United States, sello@cs.brown.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We introduce constraints based on grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy. We devise an arc-consistency algorithm for context-free grammars, investigate when logic combinations of grammar constraints are tractable, show how to exploit non-constant size grammars and re-orderings of languages, and study where the boundaries run between regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammar filtering.
