We devise an arc-consistency algorithm for context-free grammars, investigate when logic combinations of grammar constraints are tractable, show how to exploit non-constant size grammars and re-orderings of languages, and study where the boundaries run between regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammar filtering.</br>
