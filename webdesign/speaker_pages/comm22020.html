Title: Pickup and Delivery Work Area Segmentation via Constrained Contiguous Clustering<br>Author: Ahmad Jarrah, Associate Professor, George Washington University, Department of Decision Sciences, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, jarrah@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Bard<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The focus of this problem class is that of partitioning a region into geographically contiguous sub-areas while optimizing an objective measure and adhering to capacity constraints.  The motivating application is that of large pickup-and-delivery networks involving thousands of loads each day.  A column-generation based heuristic approach is developed to address large-scale instances of the problem.   Modeling paradigms, solution schemes and computational experiences are discussed.
