Title: An Implicit Bidding Mechanism for Combinatorial Auctions- A Truckload Procurement Example<br>Author: Richard Chen, University of Michigan, Industrial and Operations Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, richchen@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amitabh Sinha, Amy Cohn, Damian Beil<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present an implicit bidding mechanism for fully enumerated combinatorial auctions. In our approach, the bidder's bid-generating functions are explicitly embedded within a mathematical program that is used to solve the winner-determination problem. We present extensive computational results for truckload procurement auctions to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
