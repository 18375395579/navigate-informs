The receding horizon approach solves on-line optimization problems at each time in order to construct a policy.  We show that the dynamic hedging problem for various options can be formulated so that the on-line optimizations are semi-definite programs.   Thus, we are able to effectively hedge high dimensional options.  Examples illustrate the approach.</br>
