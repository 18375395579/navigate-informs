For many problems QPB provides a good quality bound at modest computational expense. However it would be desirable to strengthen QPB on problems where the bound is less good, especially near the root of the B&B tree. We describe methodologies for strengthening QPB that continue to utilize convex quadratic programming for the bound computation.</br>
