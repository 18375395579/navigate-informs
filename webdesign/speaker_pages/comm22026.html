Title: Incremental Network Design with Maximum Flows<br>Author: Dmytro Matsypura, The University of Sydney, Rm 478 Merewether Building H04, Sydney, 2203, Australia, dmytro.matsypura@sydney.edu.au<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Kalinowski, Martin Savelsbergh<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Network infrastructure upgrades are a common phenomenon and typically occur over time due to various constraints. We introduce a class of incremental network design problems and focus on one of its variants: incremental network design with maximum flows. We consider the complexity of the problem, analyse the performance of natural heuristics, derive approximation algorithms, and study integer program formulations.
