<br>Title: A Column Generation Framework for Routing Problems with Time Windows</br><br>Author: Leonardo Lozano, Instructor, Universidad de los Andes, Departamento de Ingenieria Industrial, Carrera 1 Este # 19 A - 40, Bogota, Colombia, leo-loza@uniandes.edu.co</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrés L. Medaglia</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Routing problems with time windows are well known NP-Hard problems. New variants emerge in various contexts (e.g., home care) posing new challenges and including different side constraints. We propose a column generation framework that can be embedded into exact approaches or matheuristics. The novelty lies in the specialized network algorithm proposed for the pricing problem. Our framework can be extended to several routing problems like the dial-a-ride or the VRPTW with pick-up and delivery.</br>
