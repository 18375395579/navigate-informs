Title: A New Multi-class Classification Method and Its Application to Medicine<br>Author: Juan Felix Avila-Herrera, Universidad Nacional and Universidad de Costa Rica, Costa Rica, delagarita@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Munevver Mine Subasi, Michael Lipkowitz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) is a two-class classification method which integrates principles of combinatorics, optimization, and the theory of Boolean functions. We propose an algorithm based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to extend the LAD methodology to solve multi-class classification problems. We apply the proposed approach on a real-world chronic kidney disease proteomic dataset to build multi-class classification models that predict the progression of the renal disease.
