Our bicriteria treatment of these problems includes lexicographic optimization, minimization of a composite linear function, generation of schedules on the efficient frontier and the generation of all Pareto optimal solutions. Using single criteria algorithms proposed in the literature, we show the polynomial solvability of these problems.</br>
