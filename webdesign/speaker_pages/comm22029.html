Title: Bicriteria Scheduling of Equal Length Jobs with Release Dates on Identical Parallel Machines<br>Author: Hari Balasubramanian, Post-doctoral Research Associate, Mayo Clinic, 200 2nd Street SW, Rochester, MN, United States, balasubramanian.hari@mayo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ahmet Keha, John Fowler<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider parallel machine bicriteria scheduling problems for equal length jobs with release dates involving classical scheduling objectives. Our bicriteria treatment of these problems includes lexicographic optimization, minimization of a composite linear function, generation of schedules on the efficient frontier and the generation of all Pareto optimal solutions. Using single criteria algorithms proposed in the literature, we show the polynomial solvability of these problems.
