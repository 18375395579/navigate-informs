Title: A Data-mining Guided Heuristic Approach for Sensor Distribution in Multi-station Assembly Processes<br>Author: Yuan Ren, Research Assistant, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, renyuan@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper presents a data mining guided evolutionary approach, which borrows strength from both data mining and evolutionary algorithm and compensates limitations of one another, and thus produces better solutions in less time. The proposed method is used to solve an optimal sensor distribution problem in multi-station assembly processes.
