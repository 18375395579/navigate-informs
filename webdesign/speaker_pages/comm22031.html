Title: A Dynamic Spatial Price Equilibrium Model of Integrated Production-transportation<br>Author: Jose Holguin-Veras, William H. Hart Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th st, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, jhv@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ning Xu, John Mitchell, Miguel Jaller<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The paper introduces a dynamic spatial price equilibrium model that estimates urban freight-related flows for integrated producer-carrier operations that compete in a market where a generic commodity is traded. The model obtains the patterns of commodity flows, production levels, and delivery tours that maximize the profits of the suppliers. The optimization problem is solved with the assistance of a heuristic approach that decomposes the interrelated decisions.
