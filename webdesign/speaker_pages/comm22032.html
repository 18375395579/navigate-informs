Title: Optimization Services and Nonlinear Optimization<br>Author: Kipp Martin, Professor, University of Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States, kipp.martin@chicagogsb.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe how to use Optimization Services (OS) with third party nonlinear solvers.  The OS library contains an OS instance class that provides a flexible API for solvers.  The OSInstance class has a method to generate instance representations in postfix format. This is illustrated with the LINDO solver.  There are also calculate methods that use the CppAD package to provide gradient and Hessian values using algorithmic differentiation.  This is illustrated with Knitro and Ipopt.
