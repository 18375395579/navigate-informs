However, many real-world linear and linear integer programs can still require days of run time and are not guaranteed to yield a near-optimal solution. We present suggestions for diagnosing and removing performance problems in commercially available solvers, and guidelines for careful model formulation, drawing on examples from the mining and energy industries.</br>
