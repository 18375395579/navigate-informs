Title: Practical Guidelines for Solving Hard Linear and Mixed Integer Programs<br>Author: Alexandra Newman, Associate Professor, Colorado School of Mines, 1500 Illinois Street, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, anewman@mines.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ed Klotz<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Advances in hardware and software have enabled the efficient solution of many large-scale linear (integer) programs. However, many real-world linear and linear integer programs can still require days of run time and are not guaranteed to yield a near-optimal solution. We present suggestions for diagnosing and removing performance problems in commercially available solvers, and guidelines for careful model formulation, drawing on examples from the mining and energy industries.
