Title: Using Lagrangian Relaxation to Compute Capacity-Dependent Bid-Prices in Network Revenue Management<br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, 223 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, huseyin@orie.cornell.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a method to compute capacity-dependent bid-prices in the network revenue management problem. Our method relaxes certain constraints that link the decisions for different flight legs by associating Lagrange multipliers with them. When compared with the so-called deterministic linear program, our method provides a provably tighter upper bound on the optimal objective value.
