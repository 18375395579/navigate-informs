<br>Title: Acceleration and Stabilization Techniques for Column Generation applied in Workforce Planning Models</br><br>Author: Alper Uygur, Sr. Operations Research Specialist, BNSF Railway, 2400 Western Center Blvd, TOB TS-464, Fort Worth, TX, 76131, United States of America, alper.uygur@bnsf.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Wilson, Matthew Galati</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This research presents an acceleration and stabilization methodology for solving large Workforce Planning Problems with Cross-Training, using the Likelihood of Assignment heuristic and Column Generation (in DIP). To alleviate the Heading-In Effect, strategies for constructing the initial dual vector are provided. Dual vectors from RMPs at any iteration are further manipulated to prevent astray columns which cause stalling. A subproblem selection routine is proposed to accelerate the convergence.</br>
