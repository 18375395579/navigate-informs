<br>Title: Iterative Solution Methods for Beam Angle and Fluence Map Optimization in IMRT Planning</br><br>Author: Gino Lim, University of Houston, 4800 Calhoun Rd, E211 Engr. Bldg 2, Houston, TX, 77204, United States, ginolim@uh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jaewon Choi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present computational approaches for optimizing beam angles and fluence maps in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) planning. A MIP model and an LP model are used to find an optimal set of beam angles and their corresponding fluence maps. We introduce iterative beam angle elimination algorithms in which an insignificant beam angle is eliminated in each iteration. Experiments show the computational advantage of the iterative methods of this approach.</br>
