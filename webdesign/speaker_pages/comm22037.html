When Q is differentiable (and in other cases) we show that conv(S) can be obtained by lifting (in the mixed-integer programming sense) the gradient approximation to Q(x) on points of the boundary of F.  We describe some cases where this leads to polynomial-time separation and present computational experiments.</br>
