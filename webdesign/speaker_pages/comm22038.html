The objective functional is a Markov dynamic risk measure of the total cost. Dynamic programming equations are derived. Two solution methods, value and policy iteration, are discussed. In the policy iteration method we propose two algorithms for policy evaluation:  nonsmooth Newton's method and convex programming. The results are illustrated on several examples.</br>
