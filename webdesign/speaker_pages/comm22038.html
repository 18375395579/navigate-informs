Title: Risk-averse Control of Markov Models<br>Author: Andrzej Ruszczynski, Rutgers University, Department of Management Science, 94 Rockafellar Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, rusz@business.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Cavus<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Risk-averse control problems for discrete-time controlled Markov models are considered. The objective functional is a Markov dynamic risk measure of the total cost. Dynamic programming equations are derived. Two solution methods, value and policy iteration, are discussed. In the policy iteration method we propose two algorithms for policy evaluation:  nonsmooth Newton's method and convex programming. The results are illustrated on several examples.
