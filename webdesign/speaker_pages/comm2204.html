Title: Formulating and Solving Call Center Scheduling Models in Excel<br>Author: Thomas Robbins, Assistant Professor, East Carolina University, College of Business, 3212 Bate Building, Greenville, NC, 27858, United States of America, robbinst@ecu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Call Center scheduling models are often formulated as computationally intensive mixed integer programs.  In this talk we examine the drivers of computational complexity and investigate the feasibility of solving these models in what is often the supervisor’s tool of choice?Excel.  We present a number of different deterministic and stochastic formulations and discuss strategies to achieve practical solution time frames using the Excel-based Risk Solver Platform engine.
