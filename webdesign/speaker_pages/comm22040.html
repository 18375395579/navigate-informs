Our contribution is a new SDP formulation that overcomes the difficulty of the high complexity of SDP solvers by using facial reduction to reduce the problem to approximately one quarter the size of the original problem. The reduced SDP can be solved approximately 100 times faster, and it is more resistant to numerical problems from erroneous and noisy distances.
