Title: Robust Temperature Modulated Unit Commitment Problem<br>Author: Bo Zeng, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 E Fowler Ave ENB118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, bzeng@usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anna Danandeh<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The efficiency of gas generators is heavily affected by the temperature of the inlet air, which could be 10% loss. Hence, classical unit commitment models may not yield feasible solutions to meet load demand.  We consider a two-stage  unit commitment problem where temperature in next 24 hour is random, and present solution algorithms for this new type robust optimization problem.
