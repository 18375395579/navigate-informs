Title: FICO - Optimization on the FICO Analytic Cloud<br>Author: Oliver Bastert, FICO, 2665 Long Lake Rd, Roseville, MN, 55113, United States of America, oliverbastert@fico.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This demo will show you how to turn an optimization model into a full optimization application in minutes. As a second step we will demonstrate how to deploy this application on the FICO Analytic Cloud.  Once an optimization model or application is hosted on FICO Analytic Cloud, others can subscribe to them and you can begin generating review with your valuable IP. Based on several examples, we show you how to start with an optimization model, create optimization scenarios, and compare and visually analyze the execution results from your PC or your mobile device.
