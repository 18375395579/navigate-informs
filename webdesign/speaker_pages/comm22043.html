We first provide a MIP formulation for the Regional Bank’s supply planning problem after proving that the First Fit Decreasing strategy can guarantee an optimal solution of the special bin-packing problem faced in this study. We also propose several polynomial-time algorithms for deriving either optimal or near-optimal solutions for the problem under different settings.
