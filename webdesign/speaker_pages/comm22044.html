I will discuss the Thyra effort in Trilinos to develop the software infrastructure for interfacing embedded nonlinear optimization solvers while keeping well integrated with production simulation codes.  I will present the concepts behind “abstract numerical algorithms?that underlie Thyra and describe a case study involving the semi-production code Charon and the optimization solver MOOCHO.</br>
