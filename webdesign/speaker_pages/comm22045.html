Title: Tower Location for CDMA Networks Under Demand Uncertainty<br>Author: Jay Rosenberger, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Arlington, PO Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, jrosenbe@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eli Olinick<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Designing Code division multiple access networks includes determining an optimal location of radio tower. We describe a deterministic model for tower location and a stochastic model to optimize revenue given a set of constructed towers. We integrate these models in a stochastic integer programming problem that optimizes the location of towers under demand uncertainty. We develop algorithms and heuristics using Benders' reformulation, and we provide computational results.
