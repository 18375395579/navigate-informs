We describe a deterministic model for tower location and a stochastic model to optimize revenue given a set of constructed towers. We integrate these models in a stochastic integer programming problem that optimizes the location of towers under demand uncertainty. We develop algorithms and heuristics using Benders' reformulation, and we provide computational results.</br>
