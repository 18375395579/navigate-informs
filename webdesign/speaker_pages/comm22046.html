Title: Asymptotic Analysis of Sample Allocation in Stochastic Optimization<br>Author: Johannes Royset, Assistant Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Rd, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, joroyset@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Roberto Szechtman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Sample average approximations use sampling and deterministic optimization algorithms to generate solutions of stochastic optimization problems. We analyze efficient sample allocation strategies given a limited computing budget. The strategy balances errors due to sampling, inexact solution of approximate problems, and convergence to local instead of global minima.
