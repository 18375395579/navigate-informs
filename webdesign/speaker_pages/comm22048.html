Title: Time-consistent Approximations of Risk-averse Multistage Stochastic Optimization Problems<br>Author: Tsvetan Asamov, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Rd, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, tsvetan.asamov@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Andrzej Ruszczynski<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We use dynamic time-consistent formulations to approximate problems having a single coherent risk measure applied to the aggregated costs over all time periods. The dual representation of coherent risk measures is used to create a time-consistent cutting plane algorithm. Additionally, we also develop methods for the construction of universal time-consistent upper bounds. Our numerical results indicate that the resulting dynamic formulations yield close approximations to the original problem.
