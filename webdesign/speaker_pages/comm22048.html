The dual representation of coherent risk measures is used to create a time-consistent cutting plane algorithm. Additionally, we also develop methods for the construction of universal time-consistent upper bounds. Our numerical results indicate that the resulting dynamic formulations yield close approximations to the original problem.</br>
