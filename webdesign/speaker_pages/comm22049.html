Title: The Work-zone Scheduling Problem in Urban Networks<br>Author: Hong Zheng, Research Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E. Second Street, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States of America, hzheng@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chang Chiu, Eric Nava<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk we present a bi-level multi-year work zone scheduling problem and solution algorithm. The objective of the model is to minimize traffic delay considering network-wide traffic diversion. The traffic diversion is assessed via an approximated traffic assignment algorithm embedding a k-shortest path algorithm in order to speed up computational time. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the property of the proposed algorithm.
