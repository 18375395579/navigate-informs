<br>Title: A Rotation-Tour Network Model for the Robust Aircraft Maintenance Routing Problem</br><br>Author: Zhe Liang, Assistant Professor, Peking University, Chengfu Rd. 298 Founder Building 608, Beijing, 100871, China, liangzhe@coe.pku.edu.cn</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present a rotation-tour based model for the robust aircraft maintenance routing problem. The robustness of solution is improved by making the routes go through a buffer connection when the accumulated risk reaches some criterion. The computational results show that the proposed model can be solved in reasonable time for all real-life test cases. The simulation results show that the robust aircraft maintenance solutions improve the average on-time rate of the test cases by 3%.</br>
