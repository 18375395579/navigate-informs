Title: Optimal Control of an Intersection<br>Author: Erjen Lefeber, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, 5600MB, Netherlands, A.A.J.Lefeber@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Dirk van Zwieten<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper we present a method to determine an optimal periodic orbit for a fluid model describing an intersection of urban traffic. We first determine the set of feasible modes (clique problem), subsequently the possible sets of modes to use during a cycle, then the sequence of modes (traveling salesman problem), and finally the duration of each mode (quadratic program).  We apply this method to a crowded intersection in the city of Eindhoven.
