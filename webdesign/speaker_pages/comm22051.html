Title: Selectively Acquiring Ratings for Product Recommendation<br>Author: Zan Huang, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University, 419 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16870, United States, zanhuang@psu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose proactively acquiring ratings from customers for a newly introduced product to quickly improve the accuracy of the predicted ratings generated by a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm for the entire customer population. We propose an active learning sampling method that is generic to any recommendation algorithm for this rating acquisition problem and report experimental results on movie rating data.
