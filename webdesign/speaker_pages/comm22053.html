Title: Adaptive Parameterized Improving Hit-and-run for Global Optimization<br>Author: Wei Wang, Graduate Student, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering,, Box 352650, Seattle, WA, 98115, United States of America, wangwei@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zelda Zabinsky, Archis Ghate<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We generalize Improving Hit-and-Run (IHR) by parameterizing its step-size distribution. We adaptively tune the parameter based on the success rate of obtaining improving points. Analytical and numerical results on spherical programs and optimization problems with Lipschitz continuous objective functions are presented to illustrate the relationship between the parametrization and algorithm performance.
