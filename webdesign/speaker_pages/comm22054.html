Title: Optimal Clustering Approach via Quadratic Programming with Biological Application<br>Author: Chun-An Chou, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Rd., Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, joechou@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Art Chaovaitwongse, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Bhaskar DasGupta, Mary Ashley, Saad Sheikh, Isabel Caballero<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a new clustering optimization model based on likelihood measures, which is formulated as a quadratic 0-1 program to maximize the likelihood of individuals in each cluster. A linearization technique is used to reformulate this problem as a mixed integer program. The approach is used to reconstruct sibling relationships from genetic markers by grouping individuals with maximum likelihood in the same sibling set. Empirical studies on real life datasets will be presented.
