Title: Valid Inequalities for Bilevel Integer Program<br>Author: Muhong Zhang, Assistant Professor, Arizona State Unviersity, 699 S Mill Ave., Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, Muhong.Zhang@asu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Bilevel integer programs optimize hierarchical objective functions with integer variables. In this talk, we analyze the valid inequalities for the feasible upper level optimal solutions and discuss corresponding branch and bound algorithms. Numerical experiments will be presented to demonstrate the computational efficiency.
