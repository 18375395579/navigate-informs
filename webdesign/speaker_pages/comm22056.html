<br>Title: Packing Steiner Trees</br><br>Author: Eric Thornburg, Department of Mathematical Sciences, United States Military Academy, 646 Swift Road, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, eric.thornburg@usma.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Pulleyblank, Steven Horton</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: VLSI design requires efficient packing of Steiner trees linking components on a chip. We describe an algorithm for optimal generation and packing of Steiner trees in a rectilinear grid.  “Good?Steiner trees are created by a cutting plane approach using Steiner multi-cuts.  We use Benders?decomposition to pack these Steiner trees, while satisfying congestion constraints. We also discuss other applications of this approach.</br>
