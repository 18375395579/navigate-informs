Title: Ambiguity in Risk Preferences in Optimization and Control<br>Author: William Haskell, Visiting Assistant Professor, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Avenue, Los Angeles, United States of America, wbhaskell@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Rahul Jain, Z. Max Shen, J. George Shanthikumar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We discuss the problem of ambiguity in risk preferences and its relation to stochastic dominance.  We review work on stochastic dominance constrained optimization, and then we present new material on multivariate stochastic dominance constrained optimization.  Next, we show how to place stochastic dominance constraints on the distribution of reward in Markov decision processes.  We conclude the presentation by arguing for the worth of a measure of regret based on stochastic dominance.
