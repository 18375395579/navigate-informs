Title: Detecting Structure from Noisy Function Evaluations<br>Author: Susan Hunter, Cornell University, School of ORIE, 282 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, hunter@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shane Henderson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We explore methods for detecting structure in functions that can only be observed as output from a stochastic simulation. Since simulation optimization algorithms often exploit some known structure of the underlying function, such as convexity, our methods may be considered a preprocessor that informs the selection of an appropriate simulation optimization algorithm.
