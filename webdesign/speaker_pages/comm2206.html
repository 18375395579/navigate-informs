Title: A Stochastic FTTH Splitter Location-allocation Problem<br>Author: Jeongyi Moon, Korea University, Sung-buk Gu, Anam-dong 5ga, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, jeongyiimoon@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Youngho Lee, Gigyoung Park, Junsang Yuh<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a stochastic integer programming approach to solving a fiber-to-the-home passive optimal network (FTTH-PON) design problem with stochastic demand.  We propose valid inequalities and heuristic strategies that enhance the basic L-shaped algorithm within the context of branch-and-cut procedure. We also demonstrate various reformulation-techniques that facilitate to devise new solution procedures.
