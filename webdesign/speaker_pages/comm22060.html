Title: Partitioning Customers Using Overlapping Segmentation Methods<br>Author: Rong Zheng, PhD Candidate, NYU Stern School, 44 West 4th, 8-181, New York, 10012, United States of America, rzheng@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Tuzhilin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present an optimal customer segmentation problem that splits the customer base into overlapping segments performing prediction tasks and show this problem is NP-hard. We then present several polynomial-time suboptimal segmentation methods that iteratively improve the segmentation with respect to overall performance of the predictive models built on these segments. We show that the best among the proposed overlapping methods outperforms some of the previously studied non-overlapping methods.
