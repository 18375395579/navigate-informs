Each resource can be claimed by at most one turnaround at a time. In this project we develop a set partitioning model formulation of the aircraft stand allocation problem with associated resource scheduling and an optimization based solution algorithm in which knowledge about the structure of the problem is exploited to generate good feasible solutions.</br>
