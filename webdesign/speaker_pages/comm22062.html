Title: A Second-order Method for Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints<br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Asst.

We present a primal-dual method reliant on both negative curvature and Newton directions. A curvilinear search over a combination of these directions is employed for purposes of globalization. We prove that the iterates converge to a second-order KKT point. We conclude by discussing the performance of the algorithm on a test problem set of quadratic programs with equilibrium constraints.
