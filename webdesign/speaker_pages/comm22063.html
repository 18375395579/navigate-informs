<br>Title: A Dynamic Piecewise Linear SDDP Algorithm Applied to Stochastic Nonlinear Hydrothermal Scheduling</br><br>Author: Andre Luiz Diniz, Researcher, CEPEL - Brazilian Electric Energy Research Center, Av. Horacio Macedo 354, Cidade Universitária, Ilha do Fundão, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22220040, Brazil, diniz@cepel.br</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michel Ennes, Renato Cabral</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose dynamic piecewise linear models to represent nonlinear constraints and objective function in stochastic multi-stage convex optimization problems solved by stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). The proposed approach provides valid cuts and convergence bounds and yields more accurate results as compared to standard piecewise linear models, in lower CPU times. We present results of its application for the generation planning of the real large-scale Brazilian hydrothermal system.</br>
