Title: A Robust Markov Decision Process for Glycemic Control for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes<br>Author: Yuanhui Zhang, PhD Student, North Carolina State University, 375 Daniels Hall, Campus Box 7906, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, yzhang29@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton, Jennifer Mason, Nilay Shah, Steven Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a Robust Markov Decision Process (MDP) for treatment decisions for glycemic control in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. We describe an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method to find near optimal policies given uncertainty in transition probability matrix. Performance of the ADP method relative to the non-robust counterpart is discussed. Computational results based on a large clinical dataset are presented to illustrate the structure and influence factors of the optimal policy.
