Title: P-order Cone Programming in Portfolio Optimization<br>Author: Paul Krokhmal, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, 2403 Seamans Center, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, krokhmal@engineering.uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Policarpio Soberanis<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss a class of risk-reward optimization models that reduce to convex programming problems with p-order cone constraints. As an illustration, a portfolio optimization case study is considered. We propose LP approximation schemes and decomposition algorithms that allow for implementing the formulated p-order cone programming problems with off-the-shelf solvers.
