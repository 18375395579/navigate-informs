The formulated network optimization model has a bi-level structure: the upper-level part is aimed at optimizing the allocation of network capacity and connectivity; the lower-level problem serves as a network flow evaluation framed into a cell transmission model. An integrated Lagrangian relaxation and tabu search method is developed to search for optimal solutions.</br>
