Title: Hooking Optimization Services to Modeling Languages and Solvers<br>Author: Robert Fourer, Professor, Northwestern University, Dept. of Industrial Eng & Mgmnt Sciences, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States of America, 4er@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kipp Martin, Jun Ma<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The OS framework is designed to avoid duplication of effort by means of a new standard for representing optimization problem instances.  Once adopted, this standard will require only one interface to be written for each modeling system and each solver.  At the heart of our proposal are OsiL, an XML-based representation for optimization problem instances, and OSInstance, a corresponding in-memory representation, together with an object-oriented library of methods for working with these forms.
