We first show that pairing and mixing schemes can obtain strong valid inequalities and under certain conditions, these inequalities can describe the convex hull of the polytope. Then, we provide a study on lifting schemes for this polytope. Especially, we explore sequence independent and sequence dominant lifting properties for this polytope. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.</br>
