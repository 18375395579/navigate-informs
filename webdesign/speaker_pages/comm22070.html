Berkeley, ggupta@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Avijit Mukherjee, Dr. Banavar Sridhar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents an optimization model for designing a high capacity en-route tube network. The design problem is formulated as a mixed integer program, and the network is structured as a multi-commodity flow network. Various cost factors crucial in designing the network are identified and incorporated in the formulation. The characteristics of resulting tube networks are compared and the effects of such a network on the traffic are identified</br>
