Title: Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming for Optimal Design and Operation of Simulated Moving Bed Processes<br>Author: Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, kawajiri@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lorenz Biegler<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) chromatography is a widely used separation technique in chemical process industries, which is modeled by Partial Differential Algebra ic Equations (PDAEs). We present several optimization case studies of large-scale nonlinear programming of SMB with over 100,000 variables solved efficiently us ing IPOPT.
