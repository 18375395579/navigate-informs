Title: Fixed Tours vs. Complete Reoptimization Strategies for the Online Inventory Routing Problem<br>Author: Ricardo Giesen, Assistant Professor, Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago, Chile, giesen@ing.puc.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Jaillet, Hani Mahmassani<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study strategies for the online inventory routing problem (OIRP). We propose two decomposition approaches for the OIRP, in which a simplified version of either the control or the routing side is solved first, and then that solution is used as a soft constraint when solving the other. For each approach, different rolling horizon strategies are proposed. The performance of proposed strategies is simulated and the impacts of using real-time information are discussed.
