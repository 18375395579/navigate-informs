We propose two decomposition approaches for the OIRP, in which a simplified version of either the control or the routing side is solved first, and then that solution is used as a soft constraint when solving the other. For each approach, different rolling horizon strategies are proposed. The performance of proposed strategies is simulated and the impacts of using real-time information are discussed.</br>
