This problem arises in telecommunication network design and package routing in logistics. We will show that searching over node-level based exchanges such as shifts and swaps discussed in the literature is equivalent to search over a restricted dynamic program for the HMSTP. This study suggests new (or variations on the) neighborhood structures for the problem.</br>
