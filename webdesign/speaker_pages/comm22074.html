Title: Distributed Control of Multihop Wireless Networks for Full Utilization<br>Author: Atilla Eryilmaz, Post-Doctoral Associate, LIDS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 32-D566, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, eryilmaz@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eytan Modiano, Asuman Ozdaglar<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We develop a generic randomized Routing-Scheduling-Flow Control Algorithm that can be implemented for a large class of interference models. We prove that the algorithm achieves 100% throughput efficiency and fairness across flows. For a two-hop interference model, we develop specific distributed algorithms with polynomial complexity that fits into the proposed generic framework. This is the first distributed algorithm in this context that guarantees full utilization of the resources.
