Many of these models can be formulated as mixed-integer programs and are NP-Complete. We have developed novel schemes to tighten the LP relaxation of these MIPs. Some of our developments may be parallelized and may be applied to more general classes of integer programs. Finally, we will motivate these models with an application involving the thwarting of nuclear smugglers.</br>
