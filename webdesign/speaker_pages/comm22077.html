Title: Balance Concerns in Allocation Problems<br>Author: Ozlem Karsu, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom, O.Karabulut@lse.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Alec Morton<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider allocation problems where inputs are allocated to different entities such as projects or departments. In such problems a common goal is achieving a desired balance in the allocation over different categories of the entities. We propose a two dimensional framework for trading balance off against efficiency. We define and categorize reference line based balance indicators and propose formulations and solution algorithms which provide insight.
