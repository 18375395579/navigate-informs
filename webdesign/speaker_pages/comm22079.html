Title: An Enhanced Decomposition Approach for Large-scale Stochastic Transmission Planning Models<br>Author: Francisco Munoz, PhD Student, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 North Charles Street, Ames Hall 319, Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States of America, francisco.munoz@jhu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Hobbs<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: There is a growing need for transmission-planning models that account for market uncertainties and generators' response. We propose a multi-stage stochastic transmission-planning model and describe an alternative solution approach for large-scale applications using Benders decomposition. We show significant improvements in the convergence rate of the upper and lower bounds when the traditional decomposition algorithm is enhanced with accelerating techniques.
