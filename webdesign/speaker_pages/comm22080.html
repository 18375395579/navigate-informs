We obtain such auctions by focusing on a natural class of value functions that can be compactly represented by associating a value graph with the set of items the auctioneer sells. We start our analysis by establishing that when the underlying value graph is a tree (and satisfies an additional sign-consistency condition), a Walrasian equilibrium always exists, and an efficient allocation can be found by solving a linear programming formulation of the efficient allocation problem. However, when the underlying graph is not a tree, these results no longer hold. On the other hand, we also show that in this case a more general pricing equilibrium always exists, and provide a stronger linear programming formulation that can be used to identify the efficient allocation for general graphical valuations. By considering iterative solutions of the aforementioned LP formulations, and complementing them with appropriate payment rules, we obtain iterative auction formats that implement the efficient outcome at an (ex-post perfect) equilibrium. These auctions terminate when a market clearance condition holds, and rely on a simple bidder-specific graphical pricing rule: the auctioneer offers a bidder-specific price for each item, and bidder-specific discounts/markups for pairs of items. Our results suggest when value functions of bidders exhibit some special structure, it is possible to systematically exploit this structure in order to develop simple efficient iterative auction formats.</br>
