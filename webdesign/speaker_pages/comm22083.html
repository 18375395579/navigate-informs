Title: Online Primal-dual Algorithms for Maximizing Ad-auctions Revenue<br>Author: Niv Buchbinder, Technion, Computer Science dept., Technion, Haifa, --, 32000, Israel, nivb@cs.technion.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Kamal Jain, Seffi Naor<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the online ad-auctions problem introduced by Mehta et. al. We design a (1-1/e)-competitive algorithm for the problem, which is based on a clean primal-dual approach. Our basic algorithm along with its analysis are very simple. Our results are based on a unified approach developed earlier for the design of online algorithms. We show that this approach is useful for analyzing other classical online algorithms such as ski rental and the TCP-acknowledgement problem.
