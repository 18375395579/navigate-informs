Title: Stochastic Co-Optimization for Hydro-Electric Power Generation<br>Author: Shi-Jie Deng, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, deng@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haibin Sun, Youxun Shen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a stochastic programming framework for solving the optimal scheduling problem faced by a profit-maximizing hydro-electric power producer who simultaneously participates in multiple markets. The impact of market uncertainties on the co-optimization problem over a pre-specified time horizon is analyzed through the stochastic programming formulation incorporating both market participation and price uncertainties.
