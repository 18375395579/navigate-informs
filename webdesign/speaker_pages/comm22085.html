Title: Quadratic Approximation of L-natural Convex Value Functions, with Applications in Inventory and Pricing Management Problems<br>Author: Kai Wang, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States of America, kai.wang@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peng Sun, Paul Zipkin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a quadratic approximation of L-natural convex value functions that can be used in an approximate linear programming framework for large scale dynamic programs.  The approached is applied numerically to three types of problems with L-natural convex value functions: inventory control with lost sales, perishable product inventory, and joint inventory and pricing problems, and produce superior results.
