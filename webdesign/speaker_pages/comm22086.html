<br>Title: Robust Monopoly Pricing: The Case of Regret</br><br>Author: Dirk Bergemann, Campbell Professor of Economics, Department of Economics, Yale University, 28 Hillhouse Avenue, New Haven, CT, 06511, United States, dirk.bergemann@yale.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karl Schlag</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a robust version of the classic problem of optimal monopoly pricing with incomplete information. The robust version of the problem is distinct in two aspects: the seller minimizes regret rather than maximizes revenue, and the seller only knows that the true distribution of the valuations is in a neighborhood of a given model distribution. We characterize the robust pricing policy as the solution to a minimax problem for small and large neighborhoods.</br>
