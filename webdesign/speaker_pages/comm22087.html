Title: Generalized Network Inequalities for Fixed-charge Network Polyhedra<br>Author: Simge Kucukyavuz, University of Arizona, 1127 James E Rogers Way, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0020, United States, simge@sie.arizona.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a generalization of the network inequalities valid for capacitated fixed-charge network flow problems. We show the relationship between the generalized network inequalities and submodular inequalities. We give separation algorithms to identify violated generalized network inequalities. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of these inequalities for a multi-echelon supply chain problem.
