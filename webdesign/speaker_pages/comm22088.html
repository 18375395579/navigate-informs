Title: Using Non-I.I.D. Sampling Methods in Stochastic Optimization<br>Author: Tito Homem-de-Mello, Associate Professor, Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, tito@northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We discuss the use of non-i.i.d. sampling methods when solving stochastic optimization problems by sample average approximations. Our focus is on rates of convergence of approximating optimal solutions and optimal values to their true counterparts. We show that, in some cases, these methods methods can be much more efficient than standard Monte Carlo. We also discuss some techniques to implement these methods in practice. We present numerical results illustrating the discussed ideas.
