<br>Title: Optimal Speed Trajectory for Fuel Consumption Reduction at Signalized Intersection</br><br>Author: Xiaozheng He, University of Minnesota, 500 Pillsbury Dr SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55414, United States of America, hexxx069@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Henry Liu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we formulate optimal speed trajectories at signalized intersection as solutions to a multi-phase optimal control problem, which considers the impact from vehicle queues due to traffic lights. By applying the pseudospectral method, this multi-phase optimal control problem is reformulated into a nonlinear programming problem which can be solved effectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by an example.</br>
