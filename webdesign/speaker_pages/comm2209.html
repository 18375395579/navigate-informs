Title: New Rational Generating Function Techniques for Integer Programming<br>Author: Matthias Koeppe, Otto-von-Guericke-Universitaet Magdeburg, FMA-IMO, Universitaetsplatz 2, Magdeburg, 39108, Germany, mkoeppe@merkur.math.uni-magdeburg.de<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A. Barvinok (1994) presented a polynomial-time algorithm to count the  number of integer points in a polytope, when the dimension is fixed,  using his technique of polynomial-size rational generating functions.    We present new efficient primal variants of the algorithm.  We also present new applications in Integer Programming, based on the  construction of discrete relaxations, for which rational generating  techniques are used to compute strong bounds or prove infeasibility.
