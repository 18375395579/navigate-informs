Title: Probabilistic Set Covering Problem: Distributions with Sparse Support<br>Author: Anureet Saxena, Tepper School of Business, CMU, 5624 Fifth Ave, Appt C13, Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, United States of America, anureets@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We give a MIP reformulation of the probabilistic set covering problem where the 0-1 random variable has a sparse support distribution. The number of variables in the model is independent of the support size and we give a simple linear time algorithm to separate the possibly exponential sized constraints. Finally we extend our results to arbitrary poly-time computable distribution functions and discuss computational results.
