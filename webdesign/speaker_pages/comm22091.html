They showed on a 3-dimensional example that the 1-term disjunctive rank of mixed-integer polytopes can be infinite. We generalize this example to a family of high-dimensional polytopes and present a close-form description of the split closures of all ranks for these polytopes. We conjecture that the k-term disjunctive rank of the (m+1)-dimensional polytope in this family is infinite for any k
