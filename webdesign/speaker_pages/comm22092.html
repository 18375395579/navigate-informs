Title: Trolley Assignment Model for a Container Terminal with a Low Viaduct Horizontal Rail System<br>Author: Anne Goodchild, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, 121E More Hall, Box 352700, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, annegood@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karthik Mohan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper looks at improving the efficiency of an automated system, called the Low Viaduct Horizontal Rail Transportation System (LVRTS) existent at a few container terminals in China. The problem of minimizing the operation time of LVRTS is formulated as a non-linear integer programming problem, and solved using Genetic Algorithms.
