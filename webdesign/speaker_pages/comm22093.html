Title: Correcting Heterogeneous & Biased Forecast Error at Intel for Supply Chain Optimization<br>Author: Matthew P. Manary, Intel Corporation, matthew.manary@intel.com<br>Coauthor(s): Alison F. Shihata, Sean P. Willems<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Inventory optimization techniques generally require demand characterization be well behaved in error structure. However, imperfections such as bias, heterogeneity, and non-parametric residuals are common in practice. Add in system and organizational complexities that make traditional corrective procedures infeasible and modeling efforts quickly become sub-optimal. This presentation covers techniques and algorithms Intel has developed over several years to counter these common hurdles while working within the reality of corporate dynamics.
