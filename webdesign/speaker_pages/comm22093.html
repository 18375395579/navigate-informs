Manary, Intel Corporation, matthew.manary@intel.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alison F. Shihata, Sean P. Willems</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Inventory optimization techniques generally require demand characterization be well behaved in error structure. However, imperfections such as bias, heterogeneity, and non-parametric residuals are common in practice. Add in system and organizational complexities that make traditional corrective procedures infeasible and modeling efforts quickly become sub-optimal. This presentation covers techniques and algorithms Intel has developed over several years to counter these common hurdles while working within the reality of corporate dynamics.</br>
