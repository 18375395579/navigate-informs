Title: An Extreme-point Global Optimization Technique for Computing Convex Hull Prices<br>Author: Gui Wang, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 206 Transportation Building, Urbana, IL, United States of America, xjtu.wg@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag, Tongxin Zheng, Eugene Litvinov, Sean Meyn<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present an extreme-point-based algorithm for obtaining convex-hull electricity prices that relies on globally maximizing the Lagrangian dual of an MILP. Two practical limitations common to such methods are the requirement of complete subgradient information and zigzagging behavior close to the solution. The former was handled by avoiding explicit enumeration while the latter was mitigated by introducing an alternative merit function.
