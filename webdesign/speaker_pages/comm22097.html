Title: A Subgradient Approximation to LP-based Rank Optimization for Problems with Binary Output<br>Author: Kaan Ataman, Assistant Professor, Chapman University, One University Drive, Orange, CA, 92866, United States, ataman@chapman.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nick Street<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many real-world problems with binary outputs require predictive models that successfully order cases relative to each other. A general family of rank optimization algorithms that maximizes the area under the ROC curve require quadratic number of constraints with respect to the number of cases, limiting its application to moderate and large problems. We propose a subgradient approximation for formulations in the form of an LP, that significantly reduce the solving times for large datasets.
