<br>Title: Risk-Averse Enhanced Indexation</br><br>Author: Miguel Lejeune, George Washington University, 2201 G Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, mlejeune@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gulay Samatli-Pac</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a partial replication strategy to construct risk-averse enhanced index funds. The variance of the index fund return must be below a low-risk threshold with a large probability, thereby limiting the market risk exposure. We derive a deterministic equivalent for the quadratic risk constraint and develop an exact outer approximation method. The method provides a hierarchical organization of the computations with expanding sets of integer-restricted variables and scales well.</br>
