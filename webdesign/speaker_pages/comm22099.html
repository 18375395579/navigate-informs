Title: The CHOCO Constraint Solver<br>Author: Hadrien Cambazard, Ecole des Mines de Nantes, La Chantrerie - 4, rue Alfred Kastler, BP 20722, Nantes Cedex 3, France, Hadrien.Cambazard@emn.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Narendra Jussien, François Laburthe, Guillaume Rochart<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The CHOCO constraint solver is an emanation of a French academic group. Choco is a java library for constraint satisfaction problems, constraint programming, and explanation-based constraint solving. It is built on an event-based propagation mechanism with backtrackable structures. Choco also provides explanations as both an analysing and solving tool for constraint programming, uncommon search mechanisms including the decision-repair and the logical Benders decomposition schemes, etc.
