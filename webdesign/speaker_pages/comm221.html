Title: The Use of Flexible Manufacturing Capacity in Pharmaceutical Product Introductions<br>Author: Asad Ata, Southern Methodist University, HQMO3D36, 919 Hidden Ridge, Irving, TX, 75038, United States of America, ata.asad@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Eli Snir, Chester Chambers<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This work considers the value of the flexibility offered by production facilities that can easily be configured to produce new products. The focus of this work is on technical uncertainty in the context of risky new product development in the pharmaceutical industry. A stochastic dynamic optimization problem is formulated to analyze the optimal capacity and allocation decisions for a flexible facility. An optimal policy solution to this problem is obtained using Linear Programming.
