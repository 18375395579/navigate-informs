The focus of this work is on technical uncertainty in the context of risky new product development in the pharmaceutical industry. A stochastic dynamic optimization problem is formulated to analyze the optimal capacity and allocation decisions for a flexible facility. An optimal policy solution to this problem is obtained using Linear Programming.</br>
