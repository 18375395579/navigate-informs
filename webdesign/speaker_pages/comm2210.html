<br>Title: A New Open-Source Solver for MINLP</br><br>Author: Pierre Bonami, Post-Doctorate, IBM TJ Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, pbonami@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present our work related to developing an open-source solver for Mixed Integer NonLinear Programming. This solver has been developed in a joint effort by researchers both at IBM and Carnegie Mellon University. It implements three algorithms for solving convex MINLPs: a branch-and-bound, an Outer-Approximation decomposition and an hybrid method. We present computational result comparing this algorithm to classical algorithms (as implemented both in commercial solvers and in our code).</br>
