Title: Design and Dimensioning of Coupled Energy Carrier Networks<br>Author: Andrea Zelmer, Technical University of Darmstadt, Schlossgartenstr. 7, Darmstadt, 64289, Germany, zelmer@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de<br>Coauthor(s): Debora Mahlke, Daniel Waniek, Edmund Handschin, Alexander Martin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a coupled network design problem where a gas, heat, and electricity network are coupled by combined heat and power plants. The aim is to determine the topological design and the dimensions of the pipes and cables cost-efficiently in order to meet consumers?demand. Mathematically, this problem results in a hardly solvable mixed-integer nonlinear program. We approximate the nonlinearities by piecewise linear functions and analyze the underlying structure of the mixed-integer problem.
