Title: An Active Index Algorithm for the Nearest Point Problem in a Polyhedral Cone<br>Author: Zhe Liu, PhD Candidate, NC State University, Graduate Program in OR, Box 7913, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, zliu@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yahya Fathi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the nearest point problem from a given point to a given polyhedral cone in the n-dimensional space. This problem can be formulated as a convex quadratic programming problem (CQP) with special structure. We study the structure of this problem and its relationship with the nearest point problem in a pos cone, propose an efficient algorithm for solving this problem, and carry out computational experiments to evaluate its effectiveness.
