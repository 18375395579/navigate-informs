This problem can be formulated as a convex quadratic programming problem (CQP) with special structure. We study the structure of this problem and its relationship with the nearest point problem in a pos cone, propose an efficient algorithm for solving this problem, and carry out computational experiments to evaluate its effectiveness.</br>
