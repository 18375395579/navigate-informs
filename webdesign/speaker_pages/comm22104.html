Title: Parallelization of a Primal-dual IPM for SDP using OpenMP<br>Author: Brian Borchers, New Mexico Tech, Mathematics Department, 801 Leroy Place, Socorro, NM, 87801, United States of America, borchers@nmt.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: CSDP is software package for semidefinite programming that uses a primal-dual interior point method. We discuss how the software was parallelized using OpenMP, and discuss the parallel performance of the algorithm on problems of varying size.
