Title: Robust Design of a Cost-effective Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program with Design of Experiments<br>Author: Irene Vidyanti, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, irenevidyanti@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Shinyi Wu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper demonstrates the use of Design of Experiments (DoE) coupled with simulation to design a robust and cost-effective public health intervention systematically, using the design of a Diabetic Retinopathy screening program as illustration. Optimum input factor settings are determined to find settings that achieve cost-effectiveness. Then, robust parameter design is used to find settings for a robust program by treating uncertain variables - such as screening compliance - as noise factors.
