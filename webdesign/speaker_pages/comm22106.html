<br>Title: Analysis of New Variable Selection Methods for Logistic Regression Models</br><br>Author: Joaquin Pacheco, University of Burgos, Plaza Infanta Elena s/n, BURGOS, BU, Spain, jpacheco@ubu.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Silvia Casado, Laura Nunez</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: New methods to select variables for Logistic Regression are proposed. The aim is to find a smaller subset that built a good classification. Reducing dimensionality has advantages: less costs, better understanding and efficiency and efficacy. The problem consists in finding a subset of original variables that yields the greatest percentage of hits in Logistic Regression. A series of techniques based on metaheuristic strategies is proposed. They obtain better results than traditional methods.</br>
