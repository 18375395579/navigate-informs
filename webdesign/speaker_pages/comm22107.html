The problem seeks to minimize the total cost of fiber link and switches, while satisfying both the capacity of switches and the prescribed level of quality of service. We linearize the nonlinear QoS constraints by incorporating mixed-integer linear constraints with auxiliary variables. Then we devise inner and outer approximation algorithms for finding an optimal solution.</br>
