Title: Enumeration of Near-optimal Solutions in Parallel Branch and Bound<br>Author: Jonathan Eckstein, Professor, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, RUTCOR Room 155, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, jeckstei@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Phillips, William Hart<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Optimization model limitations or data inaccuracies may make one interested in multiple near-optimal solutions, rather than a single optimum.  We discuss enhancement and generalization of the PEBBL parallel branch-and-bound package's enumeration logic, which includes relative, absolute, and cardinality tolerances.  The interaction of parallelism, the cardinality tolerance, and possible duplicate solutions generated by incumbent heuristics makes for a significant implementation challenge.
