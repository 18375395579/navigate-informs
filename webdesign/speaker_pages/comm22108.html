We discuss enhancement and generalization of the PEBBL parallel branch-and-bound package's enumeration logic, which includes relative, absolute, and cardinality tolerances.  The interaction of parallelism, the cardinality tolerance, and possible duplicate solutions generated by incumbent heuristics makes for a significant implementation challenge.</br>
