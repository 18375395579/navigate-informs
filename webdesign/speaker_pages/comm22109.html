Our analysis begins with a standard welfare economic model of healthcare resource allocation and we show how the problem can be reformulated as one of finding a particular subset of the class of efficient solutions to an implied multiobjective optimisation problem. We demonstrate our approach through a worked example of treatment for clinical depression.</br>
