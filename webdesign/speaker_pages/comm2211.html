Title: A Hybrid Methodology for Freeway Work Zone Optimization with Time Constraints<br>Author: Ning Yang, University of Maryland, Department of CEE, Glenn L.

A heuristic optimization algorithm, named two-stage modified simulated annealing (2SA), is developed to search for an optimized solution. A macroscopic analytic model and a microscopic simulation program are used to evaluate the objective function in the two stages, respectively.
