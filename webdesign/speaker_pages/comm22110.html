Title: 0-1 Reformulations of the Multicommodity Capacitated Network Design Problem<br>Author: Bernard Gendron, Universit?de Montréal, C.P. 6128, Succ. Centre-ville, Montréal, QC, Canada, gendron@iro.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Antonio Frangioni<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study 0-1 reformulations of the multicommodity capacitated network design problem modeled with general integer variables to represent design decisions. We compare two cutting-plane algorithms to compute the same lower bound: one based on the generation of residual capacity inequalities within the model with general integer variables, and another based on the addition of extended linking inequalities to the 0-1 reformulation.
