<br>Title: Preserving Privacy When Sharing Distributed Transactional Data</br><br>Author: Jing Hao, PhD Student, The University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, 2601 N. Floyd Road, SM 33, PO Box 830688, Richardson, TX, 75083, United States, jhao@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Syam Menon, Sumit Sarkar</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: When data to be shared across organizations is stored in a distributed manner by the data owner, the owner must consider hiding sensitive patterns not only in the consolidated database but also within each component of the distributed database. We present an integer programming formulation for minimizing data distortion while hiding sensitive patterns, along with illustrative examples. A heuristic procedure is also presented to address problems that cannot be solved to optimality.</br>
