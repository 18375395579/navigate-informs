There has been recent interest in kinked, or non differentiable utility functions.  We consider the problem of maximizing a kinked linear utility function subject to linear constraints.  This can be formulated as a typically, large LP .  We present a modification of an active set LP algorithm which efficiently solves this LP by doing calculations in the much smaller space of original problem assets.</br>
