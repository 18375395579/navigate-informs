Title: Heuristics and Bounds for the Storage Constrained, Inbound Inventory Routing Problem<br>Author: Charles Sox, Professor and Director, The University of Alabama, Operations Management, Box 870226, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487, United States, csox@cba.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Malini Natarajarathinam, Jennifer Stacey<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present heuristics and a lower bound for route design and inventory management of inbound parts for a facility that has a limited amount of storage space in which to store inventory. We develop a lower bound as a benchmark for the heuristic solutions and show that near optimal solutions can be obtained in a reasonable amount of time by utilizing information about the amount of storage space in the route selection process.
