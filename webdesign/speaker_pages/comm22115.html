Title: Methods for Solving Optimization Problems with Stochastic Dominance Constraints<br>Author: Andrzej Ruszczynski, Professor, Department of Management Science and Information Systems, Rutgers University, 94 Rockefeller Road, Piscataway, NJ, 00854, United States, rusz@business.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nilay Noyan, Gabor Rudolf<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: For stochastic optimization problems involving dominance constraints of the second order, using the theory of existence of measures with given marginals, we derive specialized column generation techniques. Next, for problems with first order constraints, we develop specialized lower and upper bounds, based on conditional second order constraints, and we construct near-optimal feasible solutions. In portfolio optimization the methods yield improvements of order of magntide.
