Title: Scheduling a Single Sensor in a Time-variant Environment<br>Author: Mesut Yavuz, Shenandoah University, 1460 University Drive, Winchester, VA, 22601, United States, myavuz@su.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Jeffcoat<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The allocation and scheduling of sensors is a significant problem in military operations research. Recent work in the area focuses on a class of sensors able to observe multiple sites of interest, one at a time. In this research, we consider multiple sites each with time-variant activity rates. We establish computational complexity of the problem and propose both deterministic and stochastic methods for its solution. We also compare the solution methods via a computational study.
