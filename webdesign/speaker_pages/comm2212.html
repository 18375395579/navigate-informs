<br>Title: An Integrated Patient Transportation and Operating Room Scheduling Model</br><br>Author: Sepehr Nemati Proon, PhD Student, University of Pittburgh, 3700 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, sen12@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oleg Shylo, Andrew Schaefer, Oleg Prokopyev</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a model that integrates the optimal transportation of outpatients from their residences to a hospital and back using a capacitated fleet of vehicles, and surgery scheduling in an operating suite. The objective is to minimize the overall time that patients spend on the road and in the hospital. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer programming and present a Branch and Price algorithm to solve it.</br>
