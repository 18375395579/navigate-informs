Title: Energy and Reserve Dispatch in Electricity Markets: A Robust Optimization Approach<br>Author: Antonio Conejo, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Department of Electrical Engineering, Campus Universitario, Ciudad Real, 13071, Spain, Antonio.Conejo@uclm.es<br>Coauthor(s): Marco Zugno<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the dispatch of electric energy and reserve in a system with stochastic production units, and propose an adaptive robust optimization model. Using duality, we merge the uncertainty and recourse inner problems into a single problem with equilibrium constraints, which is cast as a MIP. We solve the outer dispatching problem with a cutting-plane method using either dual or primal cuts. Results obtained are compared with those derived from the corresponding stochastic programming model.
