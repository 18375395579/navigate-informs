Title: Assortment Optimization under the Multinomial Logit Model with Totally Unimodular Constraints<br>Author: James Davis, Cornell University, Rhodes hall, Ithaca, United States of America, jamesmariodavis@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Guillermo Gallego, Huseyin Topaloglu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider assortment optimization problems under the multinomial logit model with a totally unimodular constraint on the assortment of offered products. We show that this problem can be solved as a linear program. Building on this result, we show how to solve various classes of assortment and pricing models, including assortment problems with display location-specific preference weights and pricing problems with price-laddering constraints.
