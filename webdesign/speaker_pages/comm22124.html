Title: Valuing Multiple Exercise Options using Term Structure Models and Approximate Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Selvaprabu Nadarajah, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, snadarajah@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francois Margot, Nicola Secomandi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop computationally efficient least squares Monte Carlo (LSM) and approximate linear programming (ALP) methods for valuing multiple exercise, such as energy swing and storage, options, using term structure price models. Our theoretical and numerical investigation shows the superiority of an LSM version based on value, rather than continuation value, function approximation. We also structurally relate our LSM and ALP methods. This suggests further research on optimal  ALP relaxations.
