Title: Infinite-Horizon Dynamic Programming with Non-Convex Risk-Sensitive Measures<br>Author: Lin Kun, Research Assistant, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States of America, klin@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steve Marcus<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The dynamic performance measure approach is a generalization of the classical work using expected value. One drawback of this approach is that it has only been developed for coherent performance measures, which exclude a large class of important non-convex performance measures. We remedy this drawback by proving the optimality of the dynamic programming equation for infinite-horizon problems with non-convex performance measures.
