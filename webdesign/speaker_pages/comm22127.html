Title: Submodular Set Function Maximization Revisited<br>Author: Pranava Goundan, Consultant, Analytics Operations Engineering, 111 Devonshire Street, 8th Floor, Boston, MA, 02109, United States of America, pranava@alum.mit.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We revisit the problem of maximizing a nondecreasing submodular set function over matroids. Classical results on a greedy approach for this problem assume the existence of an optimal oracle that identifies at each step an element of maximum incremental value. With only an approximate oracle, we generalize the performance bounds of the greedy algorithm. Thereby we reinterpret, unify, and improve on results for generalized assignment, combinatorial auctions and related problems.
