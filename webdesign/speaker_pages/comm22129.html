<br>Title: Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning and Optimization for VMAT</br><br>Author: Jie Song, Assistant Professor, Peking University, China, songjie@coe.pku.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bofei Sun</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The latest radiation therapy technique VMAT is more complex than the well-studied IMRT, making the treatment planning problem more difficult. We study the treatment planning optimization problem for VMAT. We consider the dose optimization and MLC leaf patterns, and propose mixed-integer programming model and use Nested-Partition method to solve the problem.</br>
