Title: A Study of the Bienstock-Zuckerberg Algorithm: Incorporating Price Uncertainty.<br>Author: Marcos Goycoolea, School of Business, Universidad Adolfo Ibañez, Santiago, Chile, marcos.goycoolea@uai.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Espinoza, Eduardo Moreno, Gonzalo Muñoz, Maurice Queyranne<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A major concern of mine planners is the volatility of ore prices. Ben-tal and Nemirovski propose a robust optimization model for dealing with this uncertainty that reduces to solving a second-order-cone programming problem (SOCP). We describe an extension of the Bienstock-Zuckergerg algorithm for the precedence constrained production scheduling problem (PCPSP) that incorporates uncertainty by using this robust optimization paradigm. Computational results on real data sets are presented.
