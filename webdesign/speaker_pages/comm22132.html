A reformulation-linearization technique and an NLP solver are used to obtain a lower- and an upper bound, respectively.    We describe specific branching rules and bound tightening techniques that help solving several classes of MINLP problems. We then report on our experience on a large set of both MINLP and continuous NLP instances.
