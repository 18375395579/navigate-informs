These  additional considerations introduce multiple objectives into transportation planning problems, making the problems larger and more  complex. This presentation introduces different optimization techniques such as a heuristic network algorithm and Ant Colony optimization that can be used for efficient planning of timber transport routes under multiple goals.</br>
