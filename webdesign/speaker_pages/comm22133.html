Title: Optimization Techniques for Forest Transportation Planning under Multiple Goals<br>Author: Woodam Chung, Department of Forest Management, The University of Montana, 32 Campus Drive, Missoula, MT, 59812, United States of America, woodam.chung@umontana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pablo Aracena, Marco Contreras<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Modern forest transportation planning requires consideration of both environmental impacts and cost efficiency of forest roads. These  additional considerations introduce multiple objectives into transportation planning problems, making the problems larger and more  complex. This presentation introduces different optimization techniques such as a heuristic network algorithm and Ant Colony optimization that can be used for efficient planning of timber transport routes under multiple goals.
