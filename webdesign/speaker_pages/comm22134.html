A  path-based CTM is embedded as the traffic flow model to capture the different O-D flows at all cells and links and there is no holding-back problem in the entire network. A specialized solution technique will be developed for this problem and rigorously studied to solve general networks. We use a heuristic algorithm based on the projection method to solve the lower level (DUE) problem. A mixed integer programming (MIP) and other extensions are proposed to solve the upper level signal optimization. Extensive numerical results will illustrate the benefits of using this model and algorithm.
