<br>Title: A Bi-level Formulation for the Combined Dynamic Equilibrium based Traffic Signal Control</br><br>Author: Kien Doan, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, dtkien@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper formulates a combined dynamic signal control optimization (SCO) with dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) using a bi-level formulation. A  path-based CTM is embedded as the traffic flow model to capture the different O-D flows at all cells and links and there is no holding-back problem in the entire network. A specialized solution technique will be developed for this problem and rigorously studied to solve general networks. We use a heuristic algorithm based on the projection method to solve the lower level (DUE) problem. A mixed integer programming (MIP) and other extensions are proposed to solve the upper level signal optimization. Extensive numerical results will illustrate the benefits of using this model and algorithm.</br>
