A simple control policy called the class selection policy (CSP) is proposed based on solving a knapsack-type linear program (LP). It is shown that the CSP and its variants perform provably near-optimal in the Halfin-Whitt regimes. The analysis is based on new approaches that model the problem as loss network systems with advanced reservations.</br>
