Title: Speeding up Volume Algorithm<br>Author: Xiaodong Luo, Principal, Sabre Holdings, Inc, 8400 Halliford Court, Plano, TX, United States of America, Xdluo@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Dong Liang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Volume algorithm (Barahona and Anbil 2000, 2002) has shown success for large problems such as crew scheduling, uncapacitated facility location problem. We compare this approach with a well- studied non-linear optimization technique - Method of Multipliers, and show: they share the same primal and dual search directions and only differ on the conditions for accepting a dual iterate. We show how to accelerate the algorithm for solving large Crew Scheduling and Airline Revenue Management problems.
