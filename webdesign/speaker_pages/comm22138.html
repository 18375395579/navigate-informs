Title: Primal Dual Online Algorithms for Routing and Scheduling<br>Author: Nikhil Bansal, IBM Research, PO Box 218, Yorktown, NY, United States of America, nikhil@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: While many general techniques have been developed for design and analysis of approximation algorithms, this is not the case for online algorithms. Recently, Buchbinder and Naor developed a very general technique based on the online primal dual framework.In addition to obtaining various new results, the technique also gives substantially simpler proofs of various previous results. I will give an overview of the technique and consider various applications.
