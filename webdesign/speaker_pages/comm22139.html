Title: Information Relaxation Bounds for Infinite Horizon Dynamic Programs<br>Author: David Brown, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, United States of America, dbbrown@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Haugh<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the use of information relaxations to compute upper bounds for a general class of infinite horizon stochastic dynamic programs. A challenge in using this approach for such problems is that probabilities in general depend on actions: even with perfect information, the subproblems may not be easy to solve. We discuss some approaches for dealing with this challenge and illustrate these approaches in some applications.
