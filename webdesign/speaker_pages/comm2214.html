Title: Convergence of SAA Approaches for Stochastic MPCC with Expectation Constraints<br>Author: John Birge, Chicago GSB, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL, United States of America, jbirge@chicagogsb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mihai Anitescu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a framework to ensure convergence of sample average approximation approaches for stochastic optimization problems whose constraints include expectation operators. We discuss the applicability of our results to problems with complementarity constraints. We present an example from auction energy markets to which our framework is applicable.
