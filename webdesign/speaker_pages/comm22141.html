Title: A Benders Decomposition Method for Discretely-constrained MPECs in Energy Planning<br>Author: Sebastian de la Torre, Assistant Professor, Universidad de Málaga, Departamento de Tecnología Electrónica, Universidad de Málaga, Málaga, 29071, Spain, storre@uma.es<br>Coauthor(s): Raquel Garcia-Bertrand, Steve Gabriel, Antonio J. Conejo, Yohan Shim<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a new method to solve discretely-constrained mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (DC-MPECs) where the upper-level problems have integer variables.  These sorts of problems are important in energy and other critical infrastructure planning and we highlight some applications as well as demonstrate the new methodology.
