Title: Optimal Conversion of an Evacuation Network to Signalized and Uninterrupted Flow Intersections<br>Author: Yue Liu, Department of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, United States of America, liu28@uwm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhenke Luo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This article presents a mathematical model with a parametric variational inequality (VI) formulation of equilibrium constraints to optimize the selection and distribution of signalized and uninterrupted flow intersections for strategic planning of an emergency or special event. An efficient heuristic approach embedded with a diagonalization algorithm is developed to yield the meta-optimal solutions.
