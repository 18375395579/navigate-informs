Title: Size Matters: Optimal Calibration of Shrinkage Estimators for Portfolio Selection<br>Author: Alberto Martin-Utrera, Mr, University Carlos III of Madrid, C/ Madrid, 126 - 28903, Getafe, Madrid, 28903, Spain, amutrera@est-econ.uc3m.es<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive investigation of shrinkage estimators in the context of portfolio optimization and we make several contributions to this field. First, we propose new shrinkage estimators for both the moments of asset returns and portfolio weights. Second, we propose novel calibration criteria to compute the optimal shrinkage intensity. Finally, we propose a parametric and a nonparametric approach to estimate the shrinkage intensity.
