Todd, Professor, Cornell University, 229 Rhodes Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, mjt7@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kim-Chuan Toh, Reha Tutuncu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We will describe recent enhancements incorporated into  SDPT3-4.0-beta, a code for solving semidefinite-quadratic-  linear programming problems. This version can handle  complex data and log barrier terms in the objective  function. It deals with unrestricted variables better  than earlier versions, and can exploit low-rank constraint   matrices. In addition, a homogeneous self-dual variant is provided.</br>
