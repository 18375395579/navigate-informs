We show that these relations explains all known non-aggregation based facet-defining inequalities of high-dimensional group problems. We show in an example that these new inequalities generate cuts that are not in the rank-1 split closure of an IP. This procedure also shows how facets of two-dimensional group problems generate a subfamily of the two-step MIR inequalities.</br>
