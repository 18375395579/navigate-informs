Title: Sequential-merge Inequalities for Infinite Group Problems<br>Author: Santanu Dey, Purdue University, 105 East Oak Street, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, sdey@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present relations between facet-defining inequalities of infinite group problems with different dimensions. We show that these relations explains all known non-aggregation based facet-defining inequalities of high-dimensional group problems. We show in an example that these new inequalities generate cuts that are not in the rank-1 split closure of an IP. This procedure also shows how facets of two-dimensional group problems generate a subfamily of the two-step MIR inequalities.
