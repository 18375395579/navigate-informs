Title: 2-Club Clustering<br>Author: Sergiy Butenko, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, butenko@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Oleksii Ursulenko<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of partitioning an unweighted network into clusters of diameter at most 2, so called 2-clubs.  This method of clustering is preferable in applications where the length of the shortest path between the nodes is the most relevant measure of similarity. We provide several heuristic approaches for this computationally intractable problem, and present numerical results.
