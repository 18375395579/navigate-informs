We explore the use of tolls for managing traffic on networks and encouraging players to select socially-efficient paths. The solution concept we use is a robust Wardrop equilibrium in which players take into account the uncertainty by solving robust shortest path problems. We study conditions under which socially optimal solutions can be enforced.</br>
