Title: Agent based Model for Dynamic Ridesharing<br>Author: Matthew Roorda, Associate Professor, University of Toronto, Department of Civil Engineering,, University of Toronto, Toronto, On, M5S 1A4, Canada, roordam@ecf.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mehdi Nourinejad<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Dynamic ridesharing brings together individuals with similar itineraries to travel together and share the costs. Centralized (binary integer programming) and decentralized (dynamic auction-based multi-agent) optimization algorithms are formulated to match passengers and drivers. An application of these methods on a large scale case study shows that the decentralized approach provides near optimal solutions for single-driver, single-passenger case, with much less computational burden.
