Centralized (binary integer programming) and decentralized (dynamic auction-based multi-agent) optimization algorithms are formulated to match passengers and drivers. An application of these methods on a large scale case study shows that the decentralized approach provides near optimal solutions for single-driver, single-passenger case, with much less computational burden.</br>
