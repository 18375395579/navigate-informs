Title: Network Simplex-like Algorithms for Stochastic Appointment Scheduling<br>Author: Robert Storer, Professor, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Av, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, rhs2@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Camilo Mancilla<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Scheduling appointment times when appointment durations are random is a common problem.  Given the sequence of appointments, and scenarios generated from duration distributions, optimizing appointment starting times is an LP.  We develop a network simplex-like algorithm to solve it, and contrast with previous algorithms based on the L-shaped method.
