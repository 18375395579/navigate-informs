<br>Title: Dynamic Voltage Scaling for Power-Limited Systems with Hard and Soft Real-Time Tasks</br><br>Author: Christos Cassandras, Professor, Boston University, 15 St. Mary's Street, Brookline, MA, 02446, United States, cgc@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shixin Zhuang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Many applications require scheduling of hard and soft real-time tasks on systems with a finite energy budget. We study voltage scaling as a dynamic optimization problem whose objective is to minimize energy consumption by dynamically allocating resources subject to real-time constraints. An efficient algorithm is developed through sample path analysis requiring no nonlinear programming problem solver. Simulation illustrates the performance improvements under different policies.</br>
