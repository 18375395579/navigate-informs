<br>Title: Duality Between Coherent Risk Measures and Stochastic Dominance Constraints in Optimization</br><br>Author: Darinka Dentcheva, Professor, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States of America, darinka.dentcheva@stevens.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrzej Ruszczynski</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider optimization problems with nonlinear second order stochastic dominance constraints formulated as relations of Lorenz curves. We demonstrate that mean-risk models with law invariant coherent risk measures appear as dual optimization problems to the  problems with stochastic dominance constraints.</br>
