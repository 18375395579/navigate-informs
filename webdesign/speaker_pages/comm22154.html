<br>Title: ZIMPL 3.3: An Open Source Modelling Language</br><br>Author: Gerald Gamrath, Research Assistant, Zuse-Institut Berlin, Takustr 7, Berlin, 14199, Germany, gamrath@zib.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thorsten Koch</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: ZIMPL is a freely available open source algebraic modelling language for describing linear and non-linear mixed integer programs. It is very portable and can be used either standalone, embedded into an application, or linked to a solver. One feature of ZIMPL is the use of rational arithmetic for all computations. We will give an overview of the latest release and in particular to the SCIP integration, which interfaces with the exact solver version of SCIP and also with the MINLP solver.</br>
