Title: Multilevel Distributed Optimization in Dynamic Supply Chain Management<br>Author: Laura Di Giacomo, Doctoral Student, Universita' degli Studi di Roma, Piazza Aldo Moro 5, Rome, 00185, Italy, l.digiacomo@caspur.it<br>Coauthor(s): Giacomo Patrizi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A distributed multilevel dynamic optimization problem is solved in the space of the control variables and in the parameter estimation space, through a general variational inequalities formulation, so that uncertainties can be handled and 'certainty equivalents' of the optimal policies can be derived.   Convergence and experimental results will be presented from Supply Chain implementations.
