Title: On the Path Marginal Cost of System Optimal Dynamic Traffic Assignment Problem<br>Author: Hong Zheng, Research Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E. Second Street, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States of America, hzheng@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xianbiao Hu, Yi-Chang Chiu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk we investigate and show a method to compute path marginal cost, on a general network with diversion points, for the system optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) problem. The method offers an effective way to solving the SO-DTA problem. Some preliminary numerical results are presented.
