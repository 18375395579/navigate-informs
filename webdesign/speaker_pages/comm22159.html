Title: A Bayesian Subset Selection Method and Application to Transportation Simulation-based Optimization<br>Author: Franco Chingcuanco, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 1-245, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, fchingcu@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Carolina Osorio<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We extend the Bayesian value of information procedure to problems of selecting the best m out of k alternatives, where the performance of an alternative is evaluated via a stochastic simulator. The method uses an economic opportunity cost loss function and considers all m-sized subsets as the underlying alternatives. The method is compared to that of other subset selection methods. It is then embedded within a simulation-based optimization algorithm to address an urban transportation problem.
