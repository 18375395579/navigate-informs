Title: Simulation-based Optimization over Discrete Sets with Noisy Constraints<br>Author: Eunji Lim, Assistant Professor, University of Miami, 1251 Memorial Drive, Coral Gables, FL, 33124, United States of America, lim@miami.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yao Luo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a constrained optimization problem over a discrete set, where only noise-corrupted observations of the objective and constraints are available. We propose a new method that converts constrained optimization into unconstrained optimization of finding a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The method then applies stochastic approximation to the Lagrangian in search of the saddle point. The proposed method is provably convergent under suitable conditions. We also present numerical examples.
