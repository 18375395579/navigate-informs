The master problem is a set-partition based formulation which proved to be useful for a variety of routing problems. For the subproblem we solve the elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints. The resulting algorithm is tested on various LRP benchmarks. The proposed column generation algorithm gave tight gaps for most of the benchmark problems.</br>
