We show that the ALP can be reduced to an equivalent, albeit much smaller, linear program. Our proof exploits the relationship between the ALP and an appropriate Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation. We develop a novel dynamic disaggregation algorithm to solve the reduced program. We generalize our results to choice-based network revenue management.</br>
