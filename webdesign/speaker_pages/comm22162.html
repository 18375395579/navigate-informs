<br>Title: Tabu Search Heuristic for the Network Design Model with Lead Time and Safety Stock Considerations</br><br>Author: Kyoungsun Lee, Ph.D. student, Purdue University, 425 W.

We introduce the concept of indirect-potential cost savings to the move evaluation step. The proposed tabu search heuristic provides near optimum solutions with much less computational efforts than the other published heuristics.</br>
