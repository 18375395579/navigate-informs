<br>Title: On Solving Convex Optimization Problems with Linear Ascending Constraints</br><br>Author: Zizhuo Wang, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, zwang@umn.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose two algorithms for solving convex optimization problems with linear ascending constraints. When the objective function is separable, we propose a dual method which terminates in finite iterations. The worst case complexity of our dual method improves over the best-known result for this problem. We then propose a gradient projection method to solve a more general class of problems. Numerical experiments show that both our algorithms work very well in test problems.</br>
