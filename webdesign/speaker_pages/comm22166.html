Title: Defender/interdictor Location Model for Protecting Critical Infrastructures<br>Author: Michael Lim, PhD Student, Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, m-lim2@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Daskin, Sunil Chopra, Achal Bassamboo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a defender/interdictor location problem for preparing against terrorist attacks. The problem results in a bi-level optimization problem which is very difficult to solve for the large problem instances. We outline a genetic algorithm for solving this problem by capturing the actions of the two opposing parties in two separate populations. Computational results and some other key issues will be addressed.
