Title: Global Optimization for Scheduling Refinery Crude Oil Operations<br>Author: Ramkumar Karuppiah, Graduate Student, Department of Chemical Engineering, Doherty Hall, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, rkaruppi@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Furman, Ignacio Grossmann<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present an Outer-Approximation algorithm to obtain the global optimum of a nonconvex Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming model for the scheduling of crude oil movement at the front-end of a petroleum refinery. A spatial decomposition of the network is performed to enhance the computational efficiency of the algorithm.
