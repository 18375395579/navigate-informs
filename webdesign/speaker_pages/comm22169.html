In practice, it is common for employees to be organized into physical or logical groups to match the layout of a facility.  A new model is proposed that integrates WSG restrictions with the shift scheduling and task assignment constraints.  The model takes the form of a large-scale integer program and is solved with one of two decomposition heuristics.</br>
