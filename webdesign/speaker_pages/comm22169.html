Title: Weekly Staff Scheduling at USPS Facilities with Workstation Group Restrictions<br>Author: Jonathan Bard, Professor, The University of Texas, 1 University Station C2200, Mechanical Engineering, Austin, TX, 78712-0292, United States, jbard@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lin Wan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk discusses the weekly adjustment problem for staff scheduling when movement restrictions exist between workstation groups (WSGs).  In practice, it is common for employees to be organized into physical or logical groups to match the layout of a facility.  A new model is proposed that integrates WSG restrictions with the shift scheduling and task assignment constraints.  The model takes the form of a large-scale integer program and is solved with one of two decomposition heuristics.
