Title: A Tutorial on Evolutionary Multi-criterion Optimization (EMO)<br>Author: Kalyanmoy Deb, Professor, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kanpur, UP, 208016, India, deb@iitk.ac.in<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: For the past two decades, multi-criterion optimization problems have been increasingly being solved using evolutionary optimization methods, simply due to their parallel search and ability to find multiple trade-off solutions in a single simulation. In this tutorial, we shall present principles of EMO, results on a number of challenging problems and highlight some recent research challenges.
