Title: Functional Annealing for Unconstrained Quadratic Binary Optimization<br>Author: Dushyant Sharma, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, dushyant75@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Dushyant Sharma<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe stochastic search algorithms for unconstrained quadratic binary optimization that are based on Functional Annealing. The underlying local improvement algorithms are based on the standard one exchange neighborhood and a neighborhood obtained by exploiting easily solvable restrictions of the problem. Computational tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Functional Annealing for the problem.
