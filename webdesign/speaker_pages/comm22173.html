Title: Wind Driven Optimization for Scheduling<br>Author: Kaan Kuzu, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, Lubar Hall S485, P.O.Box 742, Milwaukee, WI, 53201-0742, United States of America, kuzu@uwm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zikri Bayraktar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce a new type of nature-inspired global optimization methodology, Wind Driven Optimization (WDO), based on atmospheric motion. The proposed technique is a population based iterative global optimization algorithm for multi-dimensional and multi-modal problems with the ability to implement constraints on the search domain. We apply the methodology to real world problems and compare its performance with the performance of other nature-inspired methodologies.
