Title: On the Benefit of Global Tail Assignment Optimization<br>Author: Thomas Schickinger, Product Manager, Lufthansa Systems, Salzufer 8, Berlin, 10587, Germany, thomas.schickinger@lhsystems.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the tail assignment problem the flight schedule is assigned to  specific aircraft near the day-of-operations. We present results of a  global tail assignment optimizer based on a generic column generation  system for crew and aircraft planning, and overview some solution  techniques. We report on case studies that investigate the  significance of the tail assignment step in an airline's overall  planning process and evaluate the room for improvement by  integration with maintenance planning.
