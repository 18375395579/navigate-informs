Title: Multidimensional Assignment Problems: Graph Theoretic and Integer Programming Heuristics<br>Author: Chrysafis Vogiatzis, Ph.D. Student, University of Florida, Weil 303, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, chvogiat@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Pardalos<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The Multidimensional Assignment Problem (MAP) is a well-known NP-hard problem, which is often used to model multi-sensor multi-target, and data association problems. In this presentation, we propose two novel decomposition schemes, employing the Augmented Lagrangian, and a graph-theoretic description of the problem to solve it heuristically. Computational results will be presented to contrast our results to the state-of-the-art.
