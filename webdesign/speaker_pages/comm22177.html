Title: Optimization Model and Solution Approach for an Integrated Relief Network Design<br>Author: Jyotirmoy Dalal, Ph D candidate, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Eng. Dept., 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77840, United States of America, jyotirmoy.dalal@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Halit Uster<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider an integrated strategic relief network design problem focusing on both fast evacuation and cost-effective distribution. We present a new solution approach combining exact optimization and heuristic techniques to solve our deterministic, multi-objective, mixed integer linear model. We present computational results and analysis providing managerial insights.
