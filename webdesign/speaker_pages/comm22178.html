Title: New Approximation Guarantee for Chromatic Number<br>Author: Eden Chlamtac, Research Assistant, Princeton University, Computer Science Building, 35 Olden Street, Princeton, NJ, United States, chlamtac@CS.Princeton.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Moses Charikar, Sanjeev Arora<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe an algorithm which colors any 3-colorable graph using O(n^0.2074) colors, thus improving the algorithms of Karger, Motwani and Sudan, and Blum and Karger, which used O(n^3/14) colors. Using ideas inspired by the work of Arora, Rao and Vazirani, we demonstrate a better relation between vector chromatic number and true chromatic number. While this gives some improvement, we obtain our best result by adding odd-cycle constraints to the semidefinite program.
