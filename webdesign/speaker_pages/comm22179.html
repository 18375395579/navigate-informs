Title: Scalable Schemes for Stochastic Nonlinear unit Commitment Problems<br>Author: Aswin Kannan, Ph.D. Student, Pennsylania State University, 3001 Plaza Drive, State College, PA, United States of America, aswinkannan1987@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the stochastic version of the unit commitment problem. Branching schemes tend to scale poorly when applied to such mixed integer optimization problems. We use an interior-point method that solves smoothed variants of the original problem. We also introduce cuts and Lagrangian relaxations to aid computing global solutions and coping with uncertainty and nonlinearity. Numerical tests suggest that the scheme scales well and computes global solutions for a majority of problems.
