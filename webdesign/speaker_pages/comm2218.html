Title: Two-stage Robust Network Design with Uncertain Capacities<br>Author: Alper Atamturk, University of California, 4175 Etcheverry Hall MC 1777, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, atamturk@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Muhong Zhang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk we consider a two-stage robust network design problem with  uncertain capacities. We give a characterization of the feasible region for the first stage and discuss the separation problem under a budget uncertainty set. Numerical experiments will be presented.
