Illustrative examples involving small-dimensional sets are presented. A generalization of perspective cuts is derived by lifting the Fenchel-Young inequalities. The theory is applied to bilinear knapsack sets, where the lifting function is found to be supermodular. This property is then used to develop valid inequalities for bilinear knapsacks and covering sets.
