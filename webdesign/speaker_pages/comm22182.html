Title: A Shadow Simplex method for infinite linear programs<br>Author: Archis Ghate, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering,, Box 352650, Seattle, WA, 98115, United States of America, archis@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Smith, Dushyant Sharma<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a Simplex-type algorithm, i. e., an algorithm that moves from one extreme  point of the infinite-dimensional feasible region to another not necessarily adjacent extreme point, for solving a class of linear programs with countably  infinite variables and constraints. Application to non-stationary infinite horizon Markov decision processes will be discussed.
