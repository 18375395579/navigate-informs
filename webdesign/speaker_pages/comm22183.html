Title: Accelerating Level Methods for Large-scale Convex Optimization<br>Author: Guanghui Lan, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, congdd@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cong Dang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce accelerated level methods optimal for large-scale convex programming problems and smoothing level methods optimal for a class of structured saddle point problems. Promising numerical results for solving certain Semidefinite programming and imaging problems will be presented.
