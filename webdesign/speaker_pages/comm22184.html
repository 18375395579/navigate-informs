Title: Global Optimization and Landscape Analysis for Clustering<br>Author: Jeffrey Heath, Visiting Assistant Professor, Centre College, 600 West Walnut Street, Danville, KY, 40422, United States, jheath@math.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Fu, Wolfgang Jank<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate the fitness landscape of clustering problems and provide evidence for why clustering via Gaussian mixtures is a difficult global optimization problem. One of the classical approaches, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, produces clusters that are only locally optimal. We introduce a new algorithm based on Model Reference Adaptive Search. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in finding global optima, thereby improving the clustering task.
