<br>Title: MILANO: Mixed-Integer Linear and Nonlinear Optimizer</br><br>Author: Hande Benson, Associate Professor, Drexel University, Department of Decision Sciences, 3141 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, hvb22@drexel.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We will present the primal-dual penalty interior-point method that is implemented in MILANO for providing warmstart capabilities and robustness in a linear and mixed-integer linear programming framework.  Extensions to cone programs and nonlinear programming problems will be explored.</br>
