Title: Branch-and-price for Dynamic Drayage Vehicle Routing Problem<br>Author: Guangming Zhang, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd C231, Evanston, IL, 60201, United States, g-zhang@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Erera, Karen Smilowitz<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This research explores the dynamic nature of drayage operations. A linear approximation function is embedded in the stochastic formulation to quickly calculate the recourse cost, and a branch-and-price solution method along time horizon is applied to provide timely schedules as well as strategies for practical implementation.
