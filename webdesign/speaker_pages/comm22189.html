Title: Hidden Structure in Constraint Reasoning Problems<br>Author: Bistra Dilkina, Cornell University, Dept. of Computer Sciences, 4148 Upson Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, bistra.cs.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ashish Sabharwal, Carla P. Gomes, Bart Selman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Modern constraint solvers can handle problems with up to a million variables and several million constraints. A recent explanation for the good scaling properties of state-of-the-art constraint solvers is that in many real-world combinatorial problems the true combinatorics is captured by a relatively small set of critical variables, called backdoor variables. We will discuss a series of new insights into backdoor variables sets.
