Title: Interdiction of Electric Power Grids with Spare Transformers<br>Author: Javier Salmeron, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Department, Monterey, 93943, United States of America, jsalmero@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Wood<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study an attacker-defender (A-D) model for interdiction of electric transmission grids, where the D can utilize limited spare parts to repair high-voltage transformers damaged by A. We solve the A-D model by Global Benders decomposition, where A’s master problem and D’s subproblem are adjusted for spares. This can be solved via integer programming or an enumeration technique. We show how tradeoffs between spare transformers and load shedding can guide inventory strategies for spare equipment.
