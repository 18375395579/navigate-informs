Title: A BFGS Gradient Sampling Algorithm for Nonsmooth Optimization<br>Author: Xiaocun Que, Lehigh University, 14 DUH DR APT 323, Bethlehem, United States of America, xiq209@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Frank Curtis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving nonsmooth and/or nonconvex optimization problems.  Problems of this type arise in a variety of applications including robust optimization, eigenvalue optimization, compressed sensing, and decomposition methods for large-scale or complex optimization problems. This algorithm, which we call BFGS-GS, is based on the BFGS method and the gradient sampling algorithm. Preliminary results show that this BFGS-GS algorithm yields benefits over the BFGS method.
