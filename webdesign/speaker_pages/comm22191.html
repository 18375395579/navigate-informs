Problems of this type arise in a variety of applications including robust optimization, eigenvalue optimization, compressed sensing, and decomposition methods for large-scale or complex optimization problems. This algorithm, which we call BFGS-GS, is based on the BFGS method and the gradient sampling algorithm. Preliminary results show that this BFGS-GS algorithm yields benefits over the BFGS method.</br>
