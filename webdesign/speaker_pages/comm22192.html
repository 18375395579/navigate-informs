Title: Dynamic Congestion Pricing Using Dual Approximation Techniques: An Initial Study<br>Author: Dung-Ying Lin, Graduate Research Assistant, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1761, ECJ Hall Suite 6.208, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, dylin@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: New dual approximation techniques based on cell transmission model (CTM) are developed to investigate the dynamic congestion pricing problem in urban highway system. We examine the implication of duals in the CTM mathematical formulation as an efficient way to price the congestion. Numerical examples and insights are presented and discussed.
