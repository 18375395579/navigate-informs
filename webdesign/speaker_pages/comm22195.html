Title: Quantum Control of Multi-Particle Simulated Annealing<br>Author: Orcun Molvalioglu, Graduate Student, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, orcun@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zelda Zabinsky, Wolf Kohn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We represent the state evolution of Multi-Particle Simulated Annealing  as a quantum system using the Schrödinger equation.  We investigate feedback control strategies for generating efficient particle trajectories. As a part of the multi-particle algorithm we design a meta-controller compatible with the quantum representation of the algorithm.
