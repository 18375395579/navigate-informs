Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, 30332, United States of America, gtg531t@mail.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Nemhauser, Shabbir Ahmed</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We review several Mixed Integer Programming formulations for separable continuous piecewise linear cost functions and their extensions to the non-separable and/or discontinuous cases. We compare both existing and new formulations by their theoretical properties and by their performance in computational experiments. We present results for different classes of transportation problems with separable/non-separable, continuous/lower-semicontinuous non-convex piecewise linear cost functions.</br>
