Title: Cardinality Cuts: Optimization and Aggregation<br>Author: Osman Oguz, Associate Professor, Bilkent University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, ooguz@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We use cardinality cuts as a means of cutting away the explored regions of the underlying polyhedron associated with a 0-1 integer programming problem. Exploration is done by solving smaller size restricted subproblems by customary branch-and-cut. Our computational experiments show that significant savings (up to more than ten times) in computing time and memory space are possible for large problems using this method.
