Title: Robust Traffic Signal Setting Design<br>Author: Ampol Karoonsoontawong, PhD Candidate, Department of Civil Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, ECJ 6.202, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, ampolk@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We formulate the robust traffic signal setting design based on dynamic user equilibrium when accounting for long-term O-D demand uncertainty. This approach enhances the traditional pre-timed signal setting design in the operational planning by providing an optimal solution that is the least sensitive to the demand variation. We develop diverse metaheuristic algorithms for this problem, and also compare the deterministic, stochastic and robust solutions using limited test networks.
