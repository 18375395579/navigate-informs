Since they are usually incomplete, ambiguous and diverse, most clustering methods cannot guarantee good performance. We propose an efficient and accurate approach to cluster diverse queries based on their ranked top-k URLs returned by the search engine. The experimental results show that our method can generate more precise clusters, with remarkably improved efficiency/scalability and robust parameter tuning.</br>
