The metrics of interest arise naturally as solutions of mathematical programming relaxations for graph partitioning problems. No analog of this embedding theory exists for directed (asymmetric) metrics, the natural distance functions that arise in considering directed problems. We discuss some successes and some obstacles in extending the embedding machinery to directed metrics.</br>
