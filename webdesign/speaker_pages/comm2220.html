Title: Directed Metrics in Graph Optimization Problems<br>Author: Yury Makarychev, Princeton University, 35 Olden Street, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States, ymakaryc@cs.princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Moses Charikar, Konstantin Makarychev, Amit Agarwal<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The theory of metric embeddings has provided a powerful toolkit for undirected graph partitioning problems. The metrics of interest arise naturally as solutions of mathematical programming relaxations for graph partitioning problems. No analog of this embedding theory exists for directed (asymmetric) metrics, the natural distance functions that arise in considering directed problems. We discuss some successes and some obstacles in extending the embedding machinery to directed metrics.
