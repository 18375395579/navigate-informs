Title: Pathfinding Problems with Uncertainty<br>Author: Hiroyuki Sato, PhD Candidate, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Department, Monterey, CA, 93940, United States, hsato@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Johannes Royset<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study pathfinding problems where objective and constraint  functions are subject to uncertainty. The vehicle traveling along  the path may also be subject to attrition. Our solution approach is  based on Lagrangian relaxation and a specialized branch-and-bound technique. We illustrate our approach with several examples from military route planning.
