Title: A Change Point Approach for Phase I Analysis in Multistage Processes<br>Author: Fugee Tsung, Professor, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, clear water bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong kong, HK, China, season@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Changliang Zou<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the Phase I analysis of a multistage process where the  input of the current process stage may be highly related to the  output(s) of the earlier stage(s). We propose a change-point approach which integrates the classical binary segmentation test with the  directional information based on the state-space model for testing  the stability of a batch of historical data. We show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms existing methods for multistage processes.
