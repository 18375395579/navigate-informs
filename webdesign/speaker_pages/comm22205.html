Title: On Chance-constrained Minimum Spanning K-core Problem under Probabilistic Edge Failure<br>Author: Juan Ma, Research Assistant, Oklahoma State University, 92S university place Apt 6, stillwater, OK, 74075, United States of America, JUAN.MA@OKSTATE.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Baski Balasundaram<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Spanning k-cores can be used to design survivable networks that preserve low diameter conditions upon vertex deletion. This talk will focus on a chance-constrained model of the minimum spanning k-core problem under probabilistic edge failures. We explored a branch-and-cut decomposition framework recently introduced in the literature, and this talk discusses problem specific enhancements via cutting-planes, scenario reduction approaches, and present preliminary numerical results.
