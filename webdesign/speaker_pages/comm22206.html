<br>Title: Combean/Grooml- A Simple Modelling Language for the Java Platform</br><br>Author: Thomas Schickinger, Combean project, Nehringstr. 3a, Berlin, 14059, Germany, thomasschickinger@web.de</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Then Open Source project Combean is aimed at integrating OR with the Java platform and at combining mathematical programming with the wealth of tools and technologies in the Java world. In this talk we report on the modelling language Grooml for (integer) linear programming. Grooml is part of Combean and has been created based on Groovy, a dynamic scripting language for the JVM. Through Combean, Grooml has access to all COIN-OSI-compatible solvers and a couple of others.</br>
