Title: Computational Comparison of Stand-centered versus Cover-constraint Formulations<br>Author: Joseph Wilck, Ph.D Candidate, Pennsylvania State University, Leonhard Building, Department of Industrial Engineering, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, jhw157@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marc McDill, Steven Mills, Sandor Toth<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The computational performance of applying the stand-centered versus the cover-constraint formulations for the area restriction model is examined on seven forests, each with two maximum harvest opening sizes.  The stand-centered formulation applied as both constraints and cutting planes is examined.  The cover constraints as cutting planes for the stand-centered formulation is also investigated.  Formulation and solution times are reported, along with spatial feasibility of those solutions.
