Title: A Branch-and-Price Approach for Solving the Critical Clique Detection Problem<br>Author: Jose L. Walteros, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-659, United States of America, jwalteros@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Pardalos<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The problem of detecting critical elements in a graph involves identifying a subset of elements whose deletion minimizes a connectivity measure of the induced subgraph. In this work we examine the problem of detecting critical cliques. We introduce two (0, 1)-linear formulations that are solved via branch-and-price. We present computational experiments comparing our results to competing formulations, as well as directions to modify our approach to tackle other critical element detection problems
