Title: A Branch-and-cut Procedure for Solving a Large-scale Next Generation Access Network Design Problem<br>Author: Youngwook Kim, Korea University / Division of Information Management Engineering, Sung-buk ku Anam dong 5-1,Seoul, S.Korea, Seoul, St, Korea, Republic of, actsmile@korea.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Kyunam Jang, Youngho Lee, Gigyoung Park<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a branch-and-cut procedure for finding the optimal solution of large-scale broadband convergence access network. We formulate the problem as a three-level capacitated facility location-allocation model that minimizes the total cost, while satisfying nonlinear QoS constraints. The proposed branch and cut procedure implements a class of disjunctive cuts.
