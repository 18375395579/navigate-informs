Title: Integrated Production and Distribution Scheduling with Committed Delivery Dates<br>Author: Zhi-Long Chen, University of Maryland, Robert H.

The shipping cost of an order decreases linearly with the delivery time used. The problem is to minimize the total shipping cost subject to the committed delivery dates constraints. The problem is strongly NP-hard. We propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm and show that its worst-case performance ratio is bound by 2 and this bound is tight.
