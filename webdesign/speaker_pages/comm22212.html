Title: Classifying Hyperspectral Imagery via a Novel Method for Augmentation by Contextual Information<br>Author: Robert Brigantic, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, 902 Battelle Blvd., P.O. Box 999, Richland, WA, 99352, United States of America, robert.brigantic@pnl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Chilton<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This presentation summarizes a method for improved performance of Bayesian classifiers for hyperspectral imagery via a novel method for augmentation by considering contextual information.  In particular, we present the use of a modified form of the Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) method.  We show this method can significantly outperform standard Bayesian classification techniques.  We then generalize this modified approach for performing hyperspectral imagery classification.
