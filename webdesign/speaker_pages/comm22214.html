<br>Title: Exact and Heuristic Procedures for Capacity Expansion Problems with Congestion</br><br>Author: Sukron Kim, PhD Student, Purdue University, School of Industrial Engineerin, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, sukgon@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Reha Uzsoy</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider optimal capacity expansion and contraction schedule decisions over time for production resources subject to congestion. We use concave clearing functions that capture the relationship between throughput and WIP. We propose a column generation procedure that uses a previously developed algorithm for the single workcenter problem. Computational experiments on randomly generated test problems show that the procedure consistently produces near-optimal solutions in modest CPU times.</br>
