Title: VLSN Search Approach for Load Planning Problem at Intermodal Rail Terminal<br>Author: Ashish Nemani, Research Assistant, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States, aknemani@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Krishna Jha, Ravindra Ahuja<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The load planning problem at a rail terminal is to assign containers and trailers to the scheduled trains to maximize the train utilization. We formulate the problem as a multicommodity flow problem on an underlying network. We solve the problem using two variants of very large scale neighborhood search heuristics. We present the computational results comparing heuristics and exact approaches.
