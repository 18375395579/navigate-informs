<br>Title: Efficient Sample Sizes in Stochastic Nonlinear Programming</br><br>Author: Johannes Royset, Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Department, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, joroyset@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elijah Polak</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A solution approach to stochastic nonlinear programs is to solve a sequence of sample average approximations (SAA). Computational issues in this approach are determination of the sample size used in each SAA and the number of iterations to be carried out on each SAA. We show that efficient sample sizes and number of iterations can be determined by solving an auxiliary minimization problem whose objective function is the computing work required to obtain a specified cost-error reduction.</br>
