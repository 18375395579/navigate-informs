Title: Disjunctive Cuts for Convex Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programs (MINLP)s and Extended Formulations<br>Author: Mustafa Kilinc, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Pittsburgh, 3700 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, United States of America, mrk46@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sina Modaresi, Jeff Linderoth, James Luedtke, Juan Pablo Vielma<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this work, we study positive effects of extended formulations on generating cutting planes for convex MINLPs. First, stronger cuts can be generated in an extended formulation. Second, the performance of a pure LP-based cut generation method can be improved via extended formulations.
