Title: An O(n log n)-time Approximation Scheme for Steiner Tree in Planar Graphs<br>Author: Glencora Borradaile, Brown University, glencora@cs.brown.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We give an O(n log n)-time approximation scheme for the  Steiner tree problem in planar graphs.   First we find a low-weight  grid-like subgraph called a brick decomposition. We show that there is a near-optimal solution, T, that crosses each face of the brick decomposition a small number of times and use this to design a dynamic program to find T.
