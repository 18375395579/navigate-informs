Quite often, many of these constraints are active at the optimum. In this talk, a discussion of constraint handling methods is presented. An overview of available tools and techniques, and associated methodology is also presented. Significant emphasis is placed on problems for which it is not possible to evaluate objectives if the constraints are violated. Also discussed is the issue of handling pass/fail constraints.</br>
