<br>Title: Incorporating Decision Makers' Inputs in a Dynamic Multistage Multiobjective Model</br><br>Author: Prashant Tarun, Ph.D Candidate, Graduate Research Assistant, The University of Texas at Arlington, PO Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, prashy@uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victoria Chen, Bill Corley</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Methods of geometric mean (GM) and successive geometric mean (SGM) of non-ones provide a practical way to compute pairwise comparison matrices at each stage of a multistage multiobjective (MSMO) model. However, the efficacy of these methods in producing consistent matrices depends solely on the quality of decision makers' inputs. We present an approach for obtaining meaningful decision makers?inputs, which enables GM and SGM to produce consistent pairwise comparison matrices.</br>
