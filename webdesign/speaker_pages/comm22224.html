Title: Strong Branching Disjunctive Cuts for MIP<br>Author: Mustafa Kilinc, PhD Student, University of Wisconsin-Madison, kilinc@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Linderoth, Andrew Miller<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Strong Branching is an effective branching technique that can  significantly reduce the size of branch-and-bound tree and the  solution time for MIP algorithms.   In this talk, we demonstrate how to   effectively use discarded information from strong branching to create   disjunctive cutting planes.  Computational results reveal that the tree   size can be effectively reduced using these inequalities.
