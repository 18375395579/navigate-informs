In this paper, we propose an integer programming model to improve the navigation effectiveness of a Web site while minimizing unnecessary changes to its structure, as it bears business or organizational logics. Thus, our approach can be applied for Web site maintenance on a regular basis. The test results show that we can provide significant improvements over the site structure by introducing very few changes.</br>
