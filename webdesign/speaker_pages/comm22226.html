Title: HMM Based Scenario Generation for an Investment Optimization Problem<br>Author: Christina Erlwein, Doctoral Candidate, CARISMA, Brunel University, John Crank Building, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, United Kingdom, Christina.Erlwein@brunel.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Gautam Mitra, Diana Roman<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We formulate an investment decision problem within a CVaR framework. Based on a hidden Markov model filtering approach we develop a scenario generator for modeling asset price dynamics. Historical data sets for gold spots and the FTSE 100 are filtered to calculate optimal parameter estimates within the hidden Markov model, scenarios for the time series are generated based on these optimal parameter estimates. The HMM parameter filtering method generates scenarios which lead to stable in-sample solutions for various investment optimization problems.
