In contrast, a combinatorial optimization problem with a knapsack constraint takes as input a budget and binary activity costs. Such models provide a prioritization only in that an activity is selected or not. If the budget or activity costs are uncertain when selecting the activities then it is sensible to create a partially-ordered priority list. We describe a stochastic integer program to do so in the context of motivating applications.</br>
