Title: Ill-Structured Problem Solving in an Optimization Course<br>Author: Sigurdur Olafsson, Assistant Professor, Iowa State University, Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States, olafsson@iastate.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Engineering problems are frequently ill-structured and many decision making problems are poorly defined with competing solutions. In optimization this occurs when assumptions and simplifications are needed for tractability. We describe an effort to bring ill-structured problem solving into a standard undergraduate optimization course. Using a web-based system, students identify the problem, make appropriate assumptions, and solve the simplified problem using standard optimization techniques.
