Title: Locating Replenishment Stations for Electric Vehicles: Application to Danish Traffic Data<br>Author: Oli Madsen, Professor, Technical University of Denmark, DTU Transport Bygningstorvet 115, Kgs.

The objective is to optimize the network performance, e.g. to maximize the flow covered by a prefixed number of stations, or to minimize the number of stations needed to cover traffic flows. Two mixed integer linear programming formulations are proposed to model the problem. These models are tested on real-life traffic data collected in Denmark.
