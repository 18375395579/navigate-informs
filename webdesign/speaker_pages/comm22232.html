Title: Extensions to AMPL for Optimisation under Uncertainty<br>Author: Gautam Mitra, President, Optirisk System, London, United Kingdom, gautam@optirisk-systems.com<br>Coauthor(s): Christian Valente, Victor Zverovich<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We describe a set of extensions to AMPL for representing robust optimisation problems and various classes of stochastic programming problems. We describe syntax and semantics of the extensions and discuss solver requirements, reformulation techniques and connection between the modelling system and external solvers. In particular, we show that direct representation of some of the modelling constructs makes the models easier to understand and facilitates the use of specialised solution algorithms.
