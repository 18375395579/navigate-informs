Title: Nested Decomposition Strategies for Stochastic Security-constrained N-K Unit Commitment<br>Author: Jean-Paul Watson, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 5800, MS 1326, Albuquerque, NM, 87113, United States of America, jwatson@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Neng Fan, Richard Chen, Ali Pinar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of stochastic security-constrained N-K unit commitment, in which the uncertainty associated with renewables generation output and load are modeled via discrete sampling. In contrast, uncertainty in generator and transmission line availability is addressed directly via N-K security constraints. We introduce a nested decomposition strategy for solving this problem, and present computational results on a number of standard benchmark problems.
