This interaction is modeled as a simultaneous game and solved by a new algorithm. Viewing minimizing the expected disruption- solution of the proposed game- as one of the objectives, facility location problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem and an evolutionary algorithm is employed to solve it.</br>
