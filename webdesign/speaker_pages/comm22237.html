Title: Combining Heuristics and Column Generation for Large Bus Driver Scheduling Problems<br>Author: Leena Suhl, University of Paderborn, Warburger Strasse 100, Paderborn, 33098, Germany, suhl@upb.de<br>Coauthor(s): Ingmar Steinzen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The bus driver scheduling problem aims to cover a given set of tasks with crew duties at minimum cost. We formulate the problem as a set partitioning (or covering) model which can be solved using column generation. We have implemented a black-box rule checker to cover work regulations arising in  practice. We discuss special hybrid IP heuristics that combine local search and column generation techniques. Computational results for real-world instances for European cities will be reported.
