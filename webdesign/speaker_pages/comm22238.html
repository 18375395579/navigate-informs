Title: On Solving Specially Structured Large SDP's<br>Author: Bharath Rangarajan, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, bharathr@me.umn.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The stability conditions for spatially-distributed systems give rise to large semi-definite programs with very special structure. In this presentation, gradient and interior-point algorithms along the lines of a Dantzig-Wolfe method are explored. The gradient techniques, while slower than interior-point methods, have the additional capability of being distributed in computation. The interior-point techniques promise a faster asymptotic convergence and an improvement in overall complexity.
