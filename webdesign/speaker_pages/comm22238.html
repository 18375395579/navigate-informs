In this presentation, gradient and interior-point algorithms along the lines of a Dantzig-Wolfe method are explored. The gradient techniques, while slower than interior-point methods, have the additional capability of being distributed in computation. The interior-point techniques promise a faster asymptotic convergence and an improvement in overall complexity.</br>
