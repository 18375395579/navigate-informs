We apply a technique building on value-at-risk methods from financial economics, IT Services Profit-at-Risk, to design IT service components. We consider the benefits of reuse vs. the quality and market differentiation of the IT services offerings. We present analytical results and simulations to derive optimal design strategies for providers.</br>
