Title: Network Design for Disaster Relief Supply Chain<br>Author: Keli Feng, Assistant Professor, South Carolina State University, 2190 Hoffman Dr, Orangeburg, SC, 29118, United States of America, kfeng1@scsu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This research aims to develop a network design model to optimally locate emergency response facilities and minimize the total system-wide costs. The emergency response facilities include State Staging Area, Point of Distribution, and neighborhood locations.  A mixed integer linear programming model is developed to solve this problem. A case study in the state of South Carolina is conducted to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of the model.
