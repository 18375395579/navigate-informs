(1993), who obtained the facial structure of the convex hull of this set. A simple separation algorithm for this set was later given by Atamturk and Rajan. The set is defined by a single capacity constraint, one nonnegative integer variable and any number of bounded continuous variables. We generalize this set by considering two integer variables and give its convex hull.</br>
