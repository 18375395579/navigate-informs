Title: A Bilevel Model and Solution Approaches for a Strategic Bidding Problem in Electricity Markets<br>Author: Marcia Fampa, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, PESC/COPPE, CP 68511, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 21941-972, Brazil, fampa@cos.ufrj.br<br>Coauthor(s): Wagner Pimentel<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A bilevel formulation for a strategic bidding problem in electricity markets is presented and solution approaches for the problem are then discussed. Numerical results are shown for case studies with configurations derived from the Brazilian electricity system.
