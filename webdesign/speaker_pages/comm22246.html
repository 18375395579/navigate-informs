<br>Title: Using Combinatorial Optimization to Predict Domain-domain Interactions</br><br>Author: Teresa Przytycka, Principal Investigator, NIH | NLM | NCBI, przytyck@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Comprehending the cell functionality requires knowledge about the functionality of individual proteins as well as the interactions among them. Proteins typically contain two or more domains, and a protein interaction usually involves binding between specific pairs of domains. Identifying such interacting domain pairs is an important step towards determining the protein-protein interaction network. We demonstrate that evolutionary parsimony principle combined with combinatorial optimization techniques leads to an approach to detecting domain-domain interactions that outperforms other methods to attack the problems.</br>
