Title: Temporal Logic Testing for Cyber-physical Systems<br>Author: Georgios Fainekos, Arizona State University, 699 S. Mill Ave, Tempe, Az, 85281, United States of America, Georgios.Fainekos@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sriram Sankaranarayanan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: One of the major challenges in Model Based Development (MBD) of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is the verification of real-time functional system properties. In general, the problem is undecidable due to the interplay between continuous and discrete system dynamics. In this talk, we present how the problem of verification can be posed as an optimization problem which can be solved using stochastic optimization techniques including Monte-Carlo methods and the Cross Entropy method.
