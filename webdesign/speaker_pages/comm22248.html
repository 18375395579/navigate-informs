Title: Robust Customized Pricing<br>Author: Elcin Cetinkaya, Doctoral Student, Lehigh University, 200 W.

The company bidding for these contracts only knows the previous bids it submitted to those businesses and whether they were accepted or not. We show how to derive tractable mathematical models for this problem and provide insights into the optimal solution. We also document the performance of the approach in numerical experiments.
