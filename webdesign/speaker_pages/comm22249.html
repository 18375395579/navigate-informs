Title: Applications of Autarkies and Persistencies in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization<br>Author: Endre Boros, Professor, RUTCOR, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, boros@rutcor.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gabriel Tavares, Ramin Zabih, Ashish Raj<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present some new results on autarkies and persistencies for QUBO problems, and their application in a polynomial tike preprocessing algorithm. We demonstrate that  in numerous applications, and in particular in image processing problems,  these techniques lead to substantial reduction in problems sizes, and frequently provide a complete optimal solution.
