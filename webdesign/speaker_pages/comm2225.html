We address an important bottleneck of parallel execution by identifying a formulation of the non-anticipativity constraints that permits the parallel solution of the master program by using structure-exploiting interior-point solvers. Our empirical results demonstrate the potential for parallel speedup and the importance of regularization in the dual optimization.
