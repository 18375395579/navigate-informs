The key innovation to our optimal control approach is to map the vector of n binary decision variables into a scalar function defined over a discrete time interval [0, n].  We define a linear quadratic tracking problem and use the necessary conditions for optimality to develop a bang-bang type solution in our algorithmic approach.</br>
