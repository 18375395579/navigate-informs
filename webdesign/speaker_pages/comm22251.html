<br>Title: A Tri-level Transmission and Generation Expansion Planning Model for a Deregulated Market</br><br>Author: Sarah Ryan, Iowa State University, Industrial & Mfg Sys Eng., Ames, IA, United States of America, smryan@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shan Jin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a tri-level integrated transmission and generation expansion planning problem in a deregulated power market environment. Transmission expansion is considered in the top level as a centralized decision due to long planning/construction lead times and concerns for network reliability. In an EPEC subproblem, multiple gencos make their own generation expansion decisions subject to wholesale market equilibrium constraints. A hybrid iterative algorithm is proposed and applied in case studies.</br>
