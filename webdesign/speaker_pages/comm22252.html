Title: Exploiting Convexity in Global Optimization<br>Author: Aida Khajavirad, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, aida@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nick Sahinidis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many nonconvex optimization problems become convex once the domain of a  small subset of their variables has been restricted. This situation arises frequently in the context of partitioning-based global optimization algorithms. We equip BARON with an advanced convexity detection tool that checks for convexity in every node of the search tree and utilizes local solvers and specialized algorithms when convexity conditions are met. Extensive computational results will be presented.
