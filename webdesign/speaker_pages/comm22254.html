Title: Solution Approaches for Integer Bilevel Programs<br>Author: Scott Denegre, Lehigh University, 200 W.

Extensions to polyhedral techniques developed for IPs are derived and new classes of valid inequalities are introduced, leading to a branch-and-cut algorithm. Particular emphasis is placed on integer interdiction problems, a subclass of IBPs and a natural extension of the network interdiction problem. Multiobjective programming techniques are used to analyze the tradeoff between resources and interdiction effort success.
