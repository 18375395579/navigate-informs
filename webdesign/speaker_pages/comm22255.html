Title: Supply Chain Scheduling with Renewable and Non-renewable Resources<br>Author: Michael Pinedo, Professor and Chair, New York University, Stern School of Business, 44 West 4th Street, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, mpinedo@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lei Lei, Shengbin Wang, Kangbok Lee<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: When supply chain operations scheduling is subject to both renewable and nonrenewable resource constraints, solving the resulting problems to optimality, especially those involving additional constraints, becomes very difficult. We present three polynomial-time solvable cases, and also a heuristic algorithm for the general case.
