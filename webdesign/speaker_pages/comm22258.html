Title: Budget Allocation Policies for School Districts: A Robust MDP Approach<br>Author: Stanko Dimitrov, Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, sdimitro@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Nedialko Dimitrov, Stefanka Chukova<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a robust Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach for allocating funding to schools in a school district over a finite planning horizon. We propose a new analytic method, derived from control theory, for solving robust MDPs with coupling budget constraints. The new approach takes into account past school performance and a limited school district budget. We conclude by providing an application of the new method to a school funding allocation problem.
