<br>Title: Systemic Risk Insurance-reinsurance Networks</br><br>Author: Jose Blanchet, Professor, Columbia University, 500W 120th Street, New York, NY, United States of America, jose.blanchet@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yixi Shi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We discuss systemic insurance and reinsurance risk networks. We obtain equilibrium settlements via the solution of a linear program, and impose a probabilistic structure that allows to compute the most likely path to a systemic breakdown via the solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. We study questions such as: Which group of companies are the most relevant from a systemic risk standpoint?, and how to quantify the role of reinsurance companies in systemic risk?</br>
