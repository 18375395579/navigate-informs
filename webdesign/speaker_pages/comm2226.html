Title: Mixed Integer Interdiction<br>Author: Scott DeNegre, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, sdenegre@Lehigh.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of interdicting a general mixed integer linear program. An MILP representing the system is given and an adversary attempts to disrupt the system by preventing certain variables from appearing in a solution. We formulate this problem as a special case of the mixed integer bilevel linear programming problem, discuss a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve it, and present computational results.
