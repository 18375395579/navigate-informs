An MILP representing the system is given and an adversary attempts to disrupt the system by preventing certain variables from appearing in a solution. We formulate this problem as a special case of the mixed integer bilevel linear programming problem, discuss a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve it, and present computational results.</br>
