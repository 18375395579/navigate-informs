Title: Using Integer Programming for Solving Problems in Information Theory<br>Author: Ahmet Keha, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, PO Box 875906, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, Ahmet.Keha@asu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk we introduce integer programming formulations for several problems in Information Theory. We study the polyhedral structure of the modular sum problem which is related with the single constraint relaxations of these problems. We finally present some computational experiments that shows the effectiveness of our models and cuts.
