<br>Title: The Zoom Strategy for Accelerating and Warm-Starting Interior Methods</br><br>Author: Michael Saunders, Professor, Department of Management Science & Engineering, Stanford University, 380 Panama Way, Stanford, CA, 94303-4026, United States, saunders@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leo Tenenblat</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Interior methods using iterative solvers for each search direction can require drastically increasing work per iteration as higher accuracy is sought.  The Zoom strategy solves first to low accuracy, and then solves for a correction to both primal and dual variables, again to low accuracy.  We zoom in on the correction by scaling it up, thus permitting a cold start. The same strategy applies to warm-starting in general.</br>
