<br>Title: Multi-item Closed-loop Inventory Control with Forecast Updates: A Model for DVD-by-Mail Services</br><br>Author: Li Chen, Assistant Professor, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, li.chen@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Safak Yucel, Kaijie Zhu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we present a multi-item forecasting-inventory model for a DVD-by-mail service provider (such as Netflix).  Our inventory model features a two-sided fixed cost for each item and a multi-item service constraint. We propose an innovative forecasting algorithm and an effective heuristic for this problem.  Simulation studies show that a significant performance improvement is achieved by the new forecasting algorithm and the multi-item optimization heuristic.</br>
