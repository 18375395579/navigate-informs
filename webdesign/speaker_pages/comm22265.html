Title: Lifted Valid Inequalities for Stochastic Dynamic Knapsack (SDKP) Sets<br>Author: Bo Zeng, Postdoctoral Research Associate, Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, bzeng@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yongpei Guan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We first derive conditions under which lifting is (complete) sequence independent, build strong superadditive approximating lifting functions and describe special cases where lifted inequalities are facet-defining. We then propose a partial sequence independent lifting approach, i.e. sequential lifting from path to path and sequence independent lifting inside paths. We finally compare these two approaches and derive cutting planes from SDKP for stochastic lot-sizing problems.
