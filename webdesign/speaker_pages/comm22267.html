Title: Improving Performance of Penalty Function with Memory by Approximate Simulation Budget Allocation<br>Author: Chuljin Park, Ph.D. candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, cpark41@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seong-Hee Kim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Penalty function with memory (PFM) has been proposed to handle stochastic constraints in discrete optimization via simulation (DOvS). In this talk, we revise an approximate simulation budget allocation method due to Lee et al. (2012) and improve the performance of PFM by combining it with the revised budget allocation method. Convergence properties of the combined DOvS algorithms are discussed and empirical results are provided on three test problems.
