Title: Nested Maximin Latin Hypercube Designs<br>Author: Gijs Rennen, Tilburg University, Room K 531, PO Box 90153, Tilburg, 5000 LE, Netherlands, g.rennen@gmail.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Latin hypercube designs (LHDs) play an important role in building metamodels for computer simulation models. To obtain data with good space-filling properties, the maximin criterion is commonly used i.e. the objective is to obtain an LHD of n points in k dimensions for which the minimal distance between any pair of points is maximized. In some situations, we however want two space-filling LHDs where one is a subset of the other. These nested LHDs will be the main topic of this presentation.
