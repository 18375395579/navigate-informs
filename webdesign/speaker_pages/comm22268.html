To obtain data with good space-filling properties, the maximin criterion is commonly used i.e. the objective is to obtain an LHD of n points in k dimensions for which the minimal distance between any pair of points is maximized. In some situations, we however want two space-filling LHDs where one is a subset of the other. These nested LHDs will be the main topic of this presentation.</br>
