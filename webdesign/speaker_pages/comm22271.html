Title: MIR Inequalities, Mixed Integer Knapsack Problems and the Closure of Single-row Systems : Part I<br>Author: Ricardo Fukasawa, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, rfukasaw@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marcos Goycoolea, William Cook<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The purpose of this work is to develop a fast algorithm for optimizing over single row systems and use it as a subroutine to perform exact separation over such systems, extending the work of Andrew Boyd to this more general case. With such a tool in hand we will be able to analyze the practical potential of valid inequalities derived from single-row Mixed Integer Programs (in particular Mixed Integer Rounding inequalities) and potentially use it to generate cuts for general MIP's.
