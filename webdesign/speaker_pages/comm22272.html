Title: Exact Algorithms for Stack Slab Shuffling Problem in Steel Industry<br>Author: Xu Cheng, PhD, Northeastern University, The Logistics Institute, Shenyang, 110819, China, chengxv@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Lixin Tang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Steel slabs are stored vertically in slab yard, as a result,shuffle operation is needed when retrieving interlayer slab. Given a sequence of slab requirement, deciding which slabs should be chosen as the target slabs, aiming at minimum shuffle number is Slab Stack Shuffling problem. This paper formulate this problem as an ILP model. Column generation and DP algorithms are developed to solve it. Computation results show that exact algorithms can get optimal solutions in a shorter time than CPLEX.
