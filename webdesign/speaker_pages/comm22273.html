<br>Title: Snow Control and Winter Maintenance Scheduling</br><br>Author: Leila Hajibabai, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N Mathews Avenue, Room 3142, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, leila.hajibabai@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seyed Mohammad Nourbakhsh, Yanfeng Ouyang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Snow control is a key component of winter maintenance for many urban/regional agencies, especially in case of heavy snowfall. In this paper, a mixed integer linear program (MILP) was proposed to simultaneously minimize total travel time of snowplow trucks and their longest individual cycle time. To solve this problem, a set of meta-heuristic methods were developed and applied to an empirical case study with realistic data.</br>
