It is hard because each training set contains multi-dimensional and multi-level class labels. Previous methods use binary classifiers and cannot handle it well. We propose a new method by exploiting the correlation among class dimensions. We cluster class labels based on the correlation and use SVM to obtain the classifier. The experiment on a biodynamic database shows our method is effective.</br>
