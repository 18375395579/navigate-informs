We consider EMS system design models where the network coverage is quantified using risk measures on random unmet demands. In particular, we describe stochastic optimization models involving integrated chance constraints introduced by Klein Haneveld (1986), and dominance constraints introduced by Dentcheva and Ruszczynski (2003).</br>
