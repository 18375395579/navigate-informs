Title: Emergency Medical Service System Design with Risk Measures<br>Author: Nilay Noyan, Assistant Professor, SABANCI University, Faculty of Engineering and Natural, Sciences, Orhanli Tuzla., Istanbul, 34956, Turkey, nnoyan@sabanciuniv.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The stochastic nature of emergency service requests is a critical issue in constructing models representing real life emergency medical service (EMS) systems. We consider EMS system design models where the network coverage is quantified using risk measures on random unmet demands. In particular, we describe stochastic optimization models involving integrated chance constraints introduced by Klein Haneveld (1986), and dominance constraints introduced by Dentcheva and Ruszczynski (2003).
