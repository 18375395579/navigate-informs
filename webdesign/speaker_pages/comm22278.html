Its ease of implementation leads to high efficiency and evidently acceptable reliability.  We review its relation to Reid's version of the Bartels-Golub update as implemented in LA05, LA15, and LUSOL.  In particular, we examine the extent to which FT implementations must live dangerously in order to achieve the desired efficiency.</br>
