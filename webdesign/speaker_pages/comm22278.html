Title: A Review of Sparsity vs Stability in LU Updates<br>Author: Michael Saunders, Stanford University, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA, United States of America, saunders@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Forrest-Tomlin update has stood the test of time within many generations of commercial mathematical programming systems.  Its ease of implementation leads to high efficiency and evidently acceptable reliability.  We review its relation to Reid's version of the Bartels-Golub update as implemented in LA05, LA15, and LUSOL.  In particular, we examine the extent to which FT implementations must live dangerously in order to achieve the desired efficiency.
