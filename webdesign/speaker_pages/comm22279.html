<br>Title: MILP Based Hyper-box Enclosure Approach for Multi-group Data Classification</br><br>Author: Fadime Uney Yuksektepe, PhD Candidate, Koc University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Rumelifeneri Yolu Sariyer, Ýstanbul, 34450, Turkey, funey@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Metin Turkay</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, a novel mixed-integer programming based hyper-box enclosure method is presented for multi-group data classification problems. In order to overcome computational difficulties, a 3-stage mathematical programming based approach is developed for training part analysis of hyper-box enclosure method. The performance of this method is tested on different benchmark datasets.</br>
