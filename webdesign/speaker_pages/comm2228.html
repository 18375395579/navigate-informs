We prove that the problem is NP-hard in general and present polynomially solvable cases. For a special case, we show that adding a constraint on the number of unsatisfied markets to the convex hull of solutions to TPMC gives an integral polyhedron. We present strong valid inequalities for TPMC and show their effectiveness in a branch-and-cut algorithm.</br>
