Title: Solving Difficult Mixed-Integer Programming Problems Using GAMS and Condor<br>Author: Michael Ferris, Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1210 W. Dayton Street, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, ferris@cs.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Bussieck<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: GAMS is a commercial modeling system for mathematical programming problems.  Condor is a resource manager that delivers huge amounts of computing cycles from large collections of distributively owned computing resources.  We describe new modeling features of GAMS and recent solver enhancements that allow us to harness the computational resources of Condor for solving difficult mixed-integer programs. We report on the solution of the MIPLIB problems timtab2, roll3000, a1c1s1 and swath.
