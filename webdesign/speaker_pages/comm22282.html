Title: Accelerated Proximal-Gradient Homotopy Method for the Sparse Least-Squares Problem<br>Author: Qihang Lin, PhD Student, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, qihangl@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Javier Peña<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We solve L1-regularized least-squares (L1LS) problem by approximately solving a sequence of L1LS with decreasing regularization parameters. Each L1LS is solved by accelerated gradient method and the returned solution is used to warm start the next L1LS. Under suitable assumptions, this method ensures that all iterates are sparse so that it obtains a global geometric convergence rate due to the strongly convexity of the objective function restricted on the sparse subspace.
