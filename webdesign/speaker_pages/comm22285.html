A robust (min-max regret) model is proposed. To solve this NP-hard problem, we first prove that the maximal regret for any schedule can be obtained by solving an assignment problem. We then develop two MILP formulations and a 2-approximation algorithm. Finally, computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods.
