No single method outperforms all methods all the time. The performance of a classification method in terms of its false-positive and false-negative rates may be unpredictable. The root to the problem is the overfitting and overgeneralization behaviors. However, it has not been studied from a comprehensive view. This study proposes the Homogeneity-Based Algorithm for optimally controlling the rates with the promising results.</br>
