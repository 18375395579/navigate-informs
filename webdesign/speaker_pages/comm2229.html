The searching algorithm was designed by using mixed set programming. Calculation result indicates that for medium and large scale examples, the delay obtained by the proposed method reduces by 24.69% compared with the sequential recovery method. By using sequential method, 22.2% examples cannot obtain feasible solution, which shows the feasibility and superority of integrated recovery method.
