<br>Title: Mixed Set Programming for Integrated Recovery of Aircraft and Crew</br><br>Author: Jinfu Zhu, Professor, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, No.29 Yudao Road, Nanjing, JS, 211100, China, zhujf@nuaa.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zhu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Constraint programming model for integrated schedule recovery of aircraft and crew was built. The searching algorithm was designed by using mixed set programming. Calculation result indicates that for medium and large scale examples, the delay obtained by the proposed method reduces by 24.69% compared with the sequential recovery method. By using sequential method, 22.2% examples cannot obtain feasible solution, which shows the feasibility and superority of integrated recovery method.</br>
