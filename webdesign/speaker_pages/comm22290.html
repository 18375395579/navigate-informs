Title: Selective Generalized Eigenvalue Classification<br>Author: Onur Seref, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, seref@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mario R. Guarracino, Erhun Kundakcioglu, Panos Pardalos<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this study, we introduce the selective generalized eigenvalue classifier (SelGEC), which is a multiple instance extension of the generalized eigenvalue classifier. We provide alternative variations including kernelized formulations for nonlinear classification. We compare the performance and accuracy of SelGEC with selective support vector machine classifiers on simulated data and on a real life neuroscience problem, and also with other methods on multiple instance classification problems.
