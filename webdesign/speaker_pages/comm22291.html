The preconditioner has the attractive property of improved eigenvalue clustering with increased ill-conditioning of the (1,1) block of the matrix. We analyze spectral characteristics and demonstrate performance on problems from the NETLIB and CUTEr test suites. The numerical experiments include results based on inexact inner iterations.</br>
