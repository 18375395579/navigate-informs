Travis Waller<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This research focuses on the problem of scheduling maintenance in mixed public-private transportation networks.  The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and trends in social welfare and toll road revenue are studied.  The research approach utilizes Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) to obtain Pareto optimality.
