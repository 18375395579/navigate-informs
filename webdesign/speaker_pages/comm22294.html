Box 5800, MS 1318, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1318, United States, jwatson@sandia.gov</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Several very effective general-purpose MIP heuristics have been introduced over the last 5 years for both incumbent generation and improvement. These include the feasibility pump, local branching, and relaxation-induced neighborhood search. We   investigate extensions and applications of these heuristics to parallel computing environments, specifically Sandia's PICO parallel MIP solver. We focus on performance assessment and general management of multiple MIP heuristics in parallel contexts.</br>
