Title: A Product-focused Approach to Pricing Optimization on a Network<br>Author: Darius Walczak, PROS Revenue Managment, 3100 Main Street, Suite 900, Houston, TX, 77382, United States of America, dwalczak@prosrm.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We briefly review existing approximations to solve the dynamic pricing optimization problem on a network where different products consume different bundles of resources.  These methods often rely on a decomposition of the network into a collection of single-resource subproblems. We contrast that with another approach built upon a product-based decomposition.  We present new insights and some numerical examples.
