Pfetsch, Tobias Achterberg</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we introduce constraint integer programming (CIP),   which is a novel way to combine constraint programming (CP) and  mixed integer programming (MIP) methodologies. We demonstrate  the advantage of CIP on the task to solve chip design verification problems. We present computational results of our solver, which is based on the CIP framework SCIP (http://scip.zib.de).</br>
