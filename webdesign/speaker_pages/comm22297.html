Instead, it may be learnt by minimizing a suitable expected-value metric. We present a coupled stochastic approximation scheme for computing the solution and learning the unknown parameter. Almost-sure convergence statements and rate estimates are provided in strongly convex as well as a merely convex regimes.</br>
