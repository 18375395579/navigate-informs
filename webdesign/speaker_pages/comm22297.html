Title: On the Solution of Stochastic Optimization Problems in Imperfect Information Regimes<br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Pennsylvania State University, 353 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, udaybag@engr.psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hao Jiang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the solution of a parametrized stochastic convex optimization problem in regimes where the prescribed parameter is unavailable. Instead, it may be learnt by minimizing a suitable expected-value metric. We present a coupled stochastic approximation scheme for computing the solution and learning the unknown parameter. Almost-sure convergence statements and rate estimates are provided in strongly convex as well as a merely convex regimes.
