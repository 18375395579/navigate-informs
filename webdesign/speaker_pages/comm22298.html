Title: OPT++: An Object-Oriented Toolkit for Nonlinear Optimization<br>Author: Patricia Hough, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 969, MS 9159, Livermore, CA, 94551, United States, pdhough@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Pamela Williams, Ricardo Oliva, Juan Meza<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe OPT++, a C++ library for nonlinear optimization.  The design is predicated on distinguishing between an algorithm-independent class hierarchy for nonlinear optimization problems and a class hierarchy for nonlinear optimization methods.  The interface is designed for ease of use and extensibility to new algorithms.  Several nonlinear optimization algorithms have been implemented, and example problems demonstrate the advantages of a common interface in comparing multiple algorithms.
