Title: Game-theoretic Network Interdiction: Heterogeneous Searchers<br>Author: R. Kevin Wood, Distinguished Professor, Operations Research Dept., Naval Postgraduate School, 1 University Circle, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, kwood@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Washburn, Lee Ewing<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A two-person zero-sum game models an interdictor who must allocate   heterogeneous searchers to maximize the probability of detecting an  evader moving through a network. We first solve an LP for an optimal marginal strategy for the interdictor, and then efficiently derive a valid mixed strategy from that: a polynomial-time,   overall solution results.   When assumptions must be relaxed,  dynamic row and column generation solve the problem.
