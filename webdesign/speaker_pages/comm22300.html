Title: A Multi-Processor Approach for Outer Approximation<br>Author: Marcel Hunting, Paragon Decision Technology, Julianastraat 30, Haarlem, 2012 ES, Netherlands, Marcel.Hunting@aimms.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We have extended the Outer Approximation algorithm in AIMMS such that for any intermediate solution found during the solution process of the master MIP problem the corresponding NLP subproblem will be solved at the same time on another processor. Moreover, multiple NLP solvers can be used to solve the same NLP subproblem to increase the possibility of finding good solutions.
