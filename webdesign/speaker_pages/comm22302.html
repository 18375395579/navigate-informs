<br>Title: The Khachiyan and Karmarkar Challenges</br><br>Author: Margaret Wright, Computer Science Department, Courant Institute of Math Sciences, New York University, NYC, NY, 10012, United States of America, mhw@cs.nyu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The field of linear programming was rocked twice within five years---in 1979 by the dramatic news of Khachiyan's polynomial-time ellipsoid algorithm, and in 1984 by Karmarkar's announcement of a polynomial-time algorithm that was 50 times faster than the simplex method.  This talk will describe what George Dantzig and researchers in his Systems Optimization Laboratory thought and did  about these events.</br>
