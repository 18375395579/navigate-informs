<br>Title: Duality Approach to Economic Lot Sizing Game</br><br>Author: Jiawei Zhang, Assistant Professor, New York University, Stern School of Business, New York, NY, 10012, United States, jzhang@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xin Chen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We use duality to analyze economic lot sizing game with concave ordering cost. The standard formulation of the corresponding optimization problem is a concave minimization problem and hence linear programming duality does not directly apply. However, we present a new formulation for the problem and construct a dual of it without duality gap.</br>
