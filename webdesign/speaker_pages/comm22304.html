<br>Title: Solution Approaches for Facility Location of Medical Supplies for Large-Scale Emergencies</br><br>Author: Hongzhong Jia, Research Assistant, University of Southern California, 2113 Oak Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90007, United States, hjia@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fernando Ordonez, Maged Dessouky</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose models and solution approaches for locating the medical supply facilities in response to large-scale emergencies. We address the problem's uncertainty by ensuring each demand point is serviced by multiple facilities at different distances. Three heuristics are developed to solve this problem: genetic algorithm, locate-allocate, and Lagrangean relaxation heuristics. We evaluate the performance of the model and the heuristics on illustrative large-scale emergency examples.</br>
