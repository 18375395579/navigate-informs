Title: Vulnerability Assessment in Physical Security Systems<br>Author: Greg Graves, Assistant Professor, U.S. Military Academy, Dept. of Mathematical Sciences, 646 Swift Road, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, greg.graves@usma.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Arrangements of forces and countermeasures to protect military bases or installations are in effect specialized physical security systems. This presentation builds on previously presented research to discuss the identification of vulnerabilities in physical security systems.  Capitalizing on a linear programming formulation to determine bounds on the expected utility of an alternative, the interpretation of the dual program provides insight into vulnerabilities present in the system design.
