<br>Title: Facet-defining Valid Inequalities for Constant-batch and Multi-module Capacitated Lot-sizing Problem</br><br>Author: Manish Bansal, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, TAMU 3131, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, bansal@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kiavash Kianfar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the valid inequalities derived using the mixing procedure of Günlük and Pochet (2001) and (k,l,S,I) inequalities of Pochet and Wolsey (1993) are facet-defining for the constant-batch lot-sizing problem. We also derive sufficient conditions for mixed n-step MIR inequalities of Sanjeevi and Kianfar (2012) to be facet-defining for multi-module lot-sizing problem (MML) and present an extended formulation for MML with Wagner-Whitin costs.</br>
