The effect is demonstrated by solving a 91-harvest unit for a twenty period problem of approximately 2690 acre problem from a logging plan prepared for the southern portion of the Oregon State University McDonald-Dunn Research Forests.  Results for this case study indicate a 14-40% saving in computational time if spatial feasibility is evaluated before calculating the objective function. Quality of the solution was similar in each case.</br>
