Our particular focus will be on Steiner triple systems and covering design problems. We generate collections of non-isomorphic feasible partial solutions with specific properties. By considering the symmetry of the constraints, we can use these partial solutions to break the original problem into several smaller subproblems. These subproblems are much easier to solve and can be done in parallel.</br>
