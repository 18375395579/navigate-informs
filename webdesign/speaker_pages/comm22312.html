Title: A Stochastic Programming Approach to Multiple Resource Constrained Job  Scheduling under Uncertainty<br>Author: Brian Keller, University of Arizona, 1127 E James E.

Potential applications of this model include team scheduling problems that arise in industries such as engineering consulting.  We develop a solution procedure based on decomposition and add several algorithmic enhancements to improve efficiency.
