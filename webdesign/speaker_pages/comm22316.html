Title: Assortment Optimization Algorithms for Non Parametric Choice Models<br>Author: Ali Aouad, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America<br>Coauthor(s): Vivek Farias, Retsef Levi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The assortment optimization problem consists in determining the selection of products a seller offers that generates an optimal revenue. Whereas this problem is known to be NP-Hard in the general non parametric setting, we manage to provide efficient polynomial algorithms to solve it for large subfamilies of the non parametric customer choice model.
