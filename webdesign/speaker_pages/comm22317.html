Title: Multiclass Dynamic User Equilibrium with a Path Based Cell Transmission Model for General Traffic Networks<br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sukkusur@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xianyuan Zhan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper presents a formulation for dynamic user equilibrium model with departure time choice and route choice for heterogeneous users and general traffic network. Cell transmission model (CTM) is embedded as the network loading procedure. The existence of equilibrium solution and OD level FIFO are proved. A new solution algorithm is proposed to solve the complementarity formulations. Numerical results show that the new algorithm outperforms the existing projection algorithm and capable of obtaining good equilibrium solution for general traffic networks.
