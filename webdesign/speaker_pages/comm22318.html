Title: Dynamic Pricing Through Adjustable Robust Optimization<br>Author: Georgia Perakis, Associate Professor, Sloan School, MIT, 50 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, georgiap@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ruben Lobel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a robust optimization approach to dynamic pricing for perishable products. The main issues in this talk are how to model demand uncertainty and how to optimize the pricing strategy. While the traditional robust optimization models are tractable, the pricing policies are static. This paper explores adaptable robust optimization  approaches to the pricing problem. We analyze a variety of models and compare them through simulations.
