Title: Portfolio Optimization for Aviation Technology Development<br>Author: Senay Solak, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Industrial and Systems Eng., Atlanta, GA, United States, ssolak@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John-Paul Clarke, Earl Barnes, Paul Collopy, Ellis Johnson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the problem of determining an optimal investment policy for a portfolio of aviation technologies. The problem is a large scale stochastic optimization model, which is not amenable to any specific method. In this study, we develop a multistage stochastic programming model which, however, differs from classical stochastic programming models since the times of realizations of uncertainty are dependent on the investment decisions. Efficient formulation and solution procedures are described.
