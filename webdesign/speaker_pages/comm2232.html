Title: Application of Three-phase Methodology on the Multistage Multiobjective Wastewater Treatment System<br>Author: Prashant Tarun, Assistant Professor, Steven L. Craig School of Business, Missouri Western State University, 4525 Downs Drive, PH 309P, Saint Joseph, MO, 64507, United States of America, ptarun@missouriwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bill Corley, Victoria Chen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The three-phase methodology presented in (Tarun et al. 2007, Tarun et al. 2008, Tarun 2008) provides a way to involve decision makers in the solution development of multiple stage, multiple objective (MSMO) optimization models. We apply our three-phase methodology in conjunction with an augmented high-dimensional, continuous-state stochastic dynamic programming to solve an MSMO Wastewater Treatment System (WTS). We will present the results and conclusions for the WTS application.
