Title: A Rough Set-decision Tree Based Approach for Design of Optimal Process Tolerances<br>Author: Sandipan Karmakar, Research Scholar, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Industrial Engineering and Management, Kharagpur, India, sandipank@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): J Maiti<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Tolerance design provides a leeway to counteract the inherent manufacturing uncertainties with desired product performance. It is important to design tolerances on process elements based on product dimensions. In this study, the authors propose a novel approach using rough set theory-decision tree to find out the best tolerance values on process elements. A example of an assembly of sheet metals for automotive body assembly is discussed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
