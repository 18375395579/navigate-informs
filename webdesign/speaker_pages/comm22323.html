Title: Computational Study of Stochastic Programs with Mean-Risk Objectives<br>Author: Tanisha Cotton, Doctoral Candidate, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, tanbgreen05@neo.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We report on a computational study of stochastic linear programs with quantile deviation and absolute semideviation risk measures. To solve standard test instances from this class of problems, we implemented subgradient decomposition algorithms, which use either aggregated or separate optimality cuts to approximate the expectation and deviation terms of the mean-risk objective function. We discuss the performance of the algorithms in terms of several performance measures and draw some insights.
