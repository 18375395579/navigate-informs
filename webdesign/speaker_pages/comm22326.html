Title: A General Framework for Intersection Cuts<br>Author: Anureet Saxena, PhD Student, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, anureets@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gabor Pataki<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Given an extreme point x of the LP-relaxation of a mixed integer program (MIP), the basis cone centered at x has been at the focus of integer programming in the past two decades. Several classes of well-known cutting planes such as intersection cuts, MIG cuts, split cuts etc can be obtained by careful examination of the conic relaxation. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the class of cutting planes which can be obtained from the conic relaxation using arbitrary disjunctions.
