Title: Fast Approximation Schemes for Scheduling Problems Related to Positive Convex Half-Product<br>Author: Hans Kellerer, Professor, Universitat Graz, Statistik and Operations Research, Universitatstrabe 15, A-8010, Graz, Austria, hans.kellerer@uni-graz.at<br>Coauthor(s): Vitaly Strusevich<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We address a version of the Half-Product Problem and its restricted version with a linear knapsack constraint. We focus on the development of fully polynomial-time approximation schemes with running times that depend quadratically on the number of variables. Applications to various scheduling problems are reported.
