The problem is stacking containers on different bays of a containership that visits several ports during a voyage.  Due to its NP-Complete nature, exact algorithms for this problem are impractical.  A heuristic approach based on Genetic Algorithm is proposed to deal with real world cases. Computational experiments and analysis of results as well as suggestions for future research are presented.
