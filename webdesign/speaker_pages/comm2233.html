Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm split the model into subproblems for each player and a master problem that coordinates the communication between the subproblems. We analyze column dropping procedures for improving the performance of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm with further testing on large and realistic models.</br>
