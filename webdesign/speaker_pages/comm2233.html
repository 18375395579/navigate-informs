Title: A Nash-Cournot Model to Assess Market Power in a Time of Use Electricity Market<br>Author: Emre Celebi, University of Waterloo, Dept of Management Sciences, Waterloo, ON, N2L3G1, Canada, ecelebi@engmail.uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): David Fuller<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine variational inequality formulation of a Nash-Cournot model with linearized DC network constraints in electricity markets with time-of-use pricing. Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm split the model into subproblems for each player and a master problem that coordinates the communication between the subproblems. We analyze column dropping procedures for improving the performance of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm with further testing on large and realistic models.
