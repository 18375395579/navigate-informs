Title: Dual-ascent for the Connected Facility Location Problem<br>Author: Gisela Bardossy, University of Maryland, Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742-1815, United States of America, mgbardossy@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): S. Raghavan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider four well known problems in the network design literature. The Steiner-Star Tree problem, the Generalized Steiner-Star Tree Problem, the Connected Facility Location Problem, and the Rent or Buy Problem. We show how the latter three problems can be modeled as Steiner-Star Tree problems. Based on this observation and a transformation of the Steiner-Star Tree problem to a degree constrained Steiner Tree problem we discuss experiments with a dual-ascent procedure for the four problems.
