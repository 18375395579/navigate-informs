Title: Interactive Evolutionary Algorithm for Solving Many Criteria Optimization Problems<br>Author: Ankur Sinha, PhD, Aalto University School of Economics, Runeberginkatu 22-24, Helsinki, 00100, Finland, ankur.sinha@aalto.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Kalyanmoy Deb, Pekka Korhonen, Jyrki Wallenius<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: It is difficult to aim for the entire Pareto-optimal frontier in optimization problems with many criteria. Some of the recent studies target the most preferred solution by seamlessly integrating the decision maker with the execution of an evolutionary algorithm. In this study, we propose one such technique where preferences are elicited from the decision maker at the intermediate steps of an evolutionary algorithm to perform a focussed search in the region of interest.
