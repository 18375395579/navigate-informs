Some of the recent studies target the most preferred solution by seamlessly integrating the decision maker with the execution of an evolutionary algorithm. In this study, we propose one such technique where preferences are elicited from the decision maker at the intermediate steps of an evolutionary algorithm to perform a focussed search in the region of interest.</br>
