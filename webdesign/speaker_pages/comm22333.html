<br>Title: An Integer Programming Approach for Synthetic Population Generation</br><br>Author: Jessica Guo, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin, 1206 Engineering Hall, 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, jyguo@wisc.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study proposes an integer programming (IP) model for synthetic population generation (SPG). The SPG is a problem of creating a microdata set to represent the individual households and their members in a population for the purpose of microsimulation. The proposed IP formulation will be presented and illustrated using US census data.  The empirical results will be compared with those obtained by the conventional solution approach based on the iterative proportional fitting procedure.</br>
