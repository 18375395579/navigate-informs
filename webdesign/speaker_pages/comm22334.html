Title: An Approximate Auction-based Coordination Mechanism for Dynamic Patient Scheduling under Uncertainty<br>Author: Hadi Hosseini, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave West, Waterloo, ON, N2L3G1, Canada, h5hosseini@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Jesse Hoey, Robin Cohen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Computing an optimal solution for the problem of stochastic healthcare scheduling is computationally intractable. We propose an approximate multiagent resource allocation technique to find possible alternatives that maximize a social welfare function. Each patient formulates its internal preferences, success model, and temporal dependencies between resources as a single MDP. An auction-based coordination mechanism is then applied to find a close-to-optimal allocation of the aggregated MDPs.
