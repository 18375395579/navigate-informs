We propose an approximate multiagent resource allocation technique to find possible alternatives that maximize a social welfare function. Each patient formulates its internal preferences, success model, and temporal dependencies between resources as a single MDP. An auction-based coordination mechanism is then applied to find a close-to-optimal allocation of the aggregated MDPs.</br>
