Title: Optimal Routes for Battery Electric Vehicles Facing Uncertainty: Extensions and Fast Algorithms<br>Author: Matthew Fontana, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, mfontana@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Magnanti, Dimitris Bertsimas, Oleg Gusikhin, Erica Klampfl, Daniel Reich, Perry MacNeille, Ryan McGee<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: To address range anxiety for drivers of battery electric vehicles, we propose a robust optimization model to find optimal routes under uncertainty and congestion while considering constraints on total energy. We expand upon previous work by developing and implementing faster algorithms to solve the problem under polyhedral and ellipsoidal uncertainty. In addition, we incorporate effects of acceleration, driver behavior, and traffic conditions into the model.
