Title: Can a Linear Value Function Explain Choices? An Experimental Study<br>Author: Jyrki Wallenius, Professor, Aalto University School of Economics, Runeberginkatu 22-24, Helsinki, 00100, Finland, jyrki.wallenius@aalto.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Pekka Korhonen, Kari Silvennoinen, Anssi Öörni<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate in a simple bi-criteria experimental study, whether subjects are consistent with a linear value function while making binary choices. Many inconsistencies appeared in our experiment. However, the impact of inconsistencies on the linearity vs. non-linearity of the value function was minor. Moreover, a linear value function seems to predict choices for bi-criteria problems quite well. This ability to predict is independent of whether the value function is diagnosed linear or not.
