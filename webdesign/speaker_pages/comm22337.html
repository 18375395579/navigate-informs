Title: Convexification Methods for Quadratic 0-1 Assignment-type Problems<br>Author: Monique Guignard-Spielberg, Professor of Operations and Information Management, The Wharton School, Department of OPIM, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, guignard@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Rong Zhu, Alex Meeraus, Marie-Christine Plateau, Aykut Ahlatcioglu, Mustafa Esen, Artur Pessoa, Peter Hahn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: One can convexify nonconvex 0-1 quadratic optimization problems in at least two different ways.  RLT linearizations are especially effective for bounding quadratic assignment-type problems.  Semi-Definite Programming was proposed recently for convexifying nonconvex quadratic 0-1 problems. We implemented this in GAMS for the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem, making it possible to compute continuous and Convex Hull Relaxation bounds exactly.
