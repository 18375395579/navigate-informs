RLT linearizations are especially effective for bounding quadratic assignment-type problems.  Semi-Definite Programming was proposed recently for convexifying nonconvex quadratic 0-1 problems. We implemented this in GAMS for the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem, making it possible to compute continuous and Convex Hull Relaxation bounds exactly.</br>
