<br>Title: Extended Mathematical Programming and Competitive Equilibrium</br><br>Author: Michael Ferris, Professor, University of Wisconsin, Computer Sciences Department, Madison, WI, United States of America, ferris@cs.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jesse Holzer</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a mechanism for describing and solving collections of optimization problems that are linked by equilibrium conditions.  The general framework captures many example applications that involve independent decisions coupled by shared resources.  We describe this mechanism in the context of energy planning and environmental and land-use problems   We outline several algorithms and investigate their computational efficiency.</br>
