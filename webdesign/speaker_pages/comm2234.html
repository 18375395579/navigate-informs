Title: A Robust Genetic Algorithm for Aircraft Sequencing Over Multiple Runways<br>Author: Mohamed Kharbeche, Qatar University, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Doha, 2713, Qatar, mkharbec@qu.edu.qa<br>Coauthor(s): Ameer Al-Salem, Ahmed Ghoniem, Hanif D. Sherali<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose an effective genetic algorithm for arrival-departure aircraft sequencing problems over multiple runways using linear and non-linear objectives. The proposed algorithm solves large benchmark instances to optimality and near-optimality within reasonable CPU times.
