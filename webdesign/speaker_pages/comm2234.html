<br>Title: A Robust Genetic Algorithm for Aircraft Sequencing Over Multiple Runways</br><br>Author: Mohamed Kharbeche, Qatar University, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Doha, 2713, Qatar, mkharbec@qu.edu.qa</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ameer Al-Salem, Ahmed Ghoniem, Hanif D. Sherali</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose an effective genetic algorithm for arrival-departure aircraft sequencing problems over multiple runways using linear and non-linear objectives. The proposed algorithm solves large benchmark instances to optimality and near-optimality within reasonable CPU times.</br>
