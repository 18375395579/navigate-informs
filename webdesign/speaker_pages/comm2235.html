Title: Approximate LP for Network Control: Column Generation and Upper Bounds<br>Author: Michael Veatch, Gordon College, 255 Grapevine Rd, Wenham, MA, 01984, United States of America, mike.veatch@gordon.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Approximate linear programming (ALP) bounds average cost for queueing network control problems. Column generation more efficiently solves the dual LP. For certain quadratic approximation architectures, the algorithm is very efficient; examples with 40 queues are approximated. Upper bound methods based on expected Bellman error are discussed.
