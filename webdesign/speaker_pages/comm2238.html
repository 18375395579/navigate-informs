Title: Dip and DipPy: A Decomposition-based Modeling System and Solver<br>Author: Ted Ralphs, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, ted@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Galati, Michael O'Sullivan, Jiadong Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: DIP is a framework for implementing decomposition-based algorithms for solving mixed-integer linear programs. The latest release includes a Python-based modeling language and a fully generic decomposition-based solver that the user can customize with callbacks for cut and column generation written in Python. We review the framework and give computational results on a variety of instances solved in parallel on a multi-core architecture.
