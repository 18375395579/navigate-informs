Title: Large-Scale Less-than-Truckload Service Network Design<br>Author: Ahmad Jarrah, Assistant Professor of Decision Science, University of Wyoming, College of Business Building 216, Laramie, WY, 82071, United States, Jarrah@uwyo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ellis Johnson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a novel formulation for designing large less-than-truckload (LTL) freight networks. The model captures the network design constraints, the load plan’s tree structure and other LTL-specific requirements. We fragment the massive model with up to 2 million 0-1 variables and 2 million rows, into a separate and efficient IP for each destination/ due day-of-week combination along with a master problem. Our results yield major annual savings (~ $20 million).
