Title: A Parallel Branch-and-cut Algorithm for Solving Dense Market-share Instances<br>Author: Eva Lee, Associate Professor and Director, Georgia Institute of Technology, Ctr for Operations Research in Medicine, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sid Maheshwary<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk, we will describe a parallel branch-and-cut algorithm involving cutting planes derived from the conflict hypergraphs of a 0/1 integer program. Aggregated branching and separation heuristics are developed. Applications to dense MIP instances arising from market-share will be presented.
