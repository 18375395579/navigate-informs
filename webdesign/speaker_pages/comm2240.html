Lagrangian multipliers and quadratic penalty terms will be introduced to relax the boundary power flow variables of tie-lines between two adjacent areas. Then the dual problem of the original problem will be decomposed into several sub-problems associated with each area. The program can stop once the gap between the upper and lower bounds satisfies a small predefined value.</br>
