Gay, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 0370, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-0370, United States, dmgay@sandia.gov</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Algorithms for large-scale optimization problems can exploit parallelism in various ways. Expensive function evaluations can sometimes be done in parallel, as can linear algebra. Branch-and-bound (and cut) algorithms may seek incumbents independently of branching and could terminate some branches when a parallel branch finds a sufficiently improved incumbent. What is worthwhile depends on the parallel constructs available and their relative costs. Many constructs have been proposed.</br>
