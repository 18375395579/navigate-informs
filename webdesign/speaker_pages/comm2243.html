The sequence of optimal solutions of the approximations converges to the true optimum. An improvement is presented when the uncertainty is given by a linear transform of a product of univariate distributions. Experiments show that the sparse grid method is very efficient for smooth integrands, and that it is potentially scalable to thousands of random variables.</br>
