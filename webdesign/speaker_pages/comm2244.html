Title: Optimal Islanding Operations under the Contingency States in Power Grids<br>Author: Mehdi Golari, PhD Candidate, The University of Arizona, 1250 E 10TH ST APT202B, Tucson, AZ, 85719, United States of America, golari@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Neng Fan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Under certain contingency states with some failed components or in the process of restoration of a failed power grid, islanding is an efficient method to isolate the failed part to prevent cascading blackout and supply the electricity to the other parts of the power system. We present a MIP model as well as efficient algorithms to solve the islanding problem.
