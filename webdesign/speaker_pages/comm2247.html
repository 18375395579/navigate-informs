Title: UAV Routing with Limited Fuel Burn Variance<br>Author: Siriwat Visoldilokpun, PhD Student, University of Texas at Arlington, PO Box 19017, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, siriwatvi@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for a UAV routing problem in which we limit variance of fuel consumption. The problem is modeled as a set-partitioning problem with a quadratic constraint. The pricing sub-problem generates new routes by solving a constrained shortest path problem. We show that the quadratic constraint can be reduced to a single knapsack constraint. We propose a new class of valid inequalities to encourage integrality. Finally, computational results are discussed.
