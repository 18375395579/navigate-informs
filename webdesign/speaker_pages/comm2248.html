Title: VaR vs. CVaR in Risk Management and Optimization<br>Author: Stan Uryasev, University of Florida, ISE dept., Gainesville, FL, United States of America, uryasev@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gaia Serraino, Sergey Sarykalin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: From a mathematical perspective risk management is a procedure for shaping a risk distribution.Value-at-Risk (VaR)and Conditional Value-at-Risk(CVaR)are key percentile risk measures.Differences in mathematical properties, stability of estimation, ease of optimization, acceptance by regulators affect the choice between VaR and CVaR.We present our experience with these functions and explain their strong and weak features.We show optimization case studies conducted with Portfolio Safeguard package
