Title: Models of Clustering of High-dimensional Microarray<br>Author: Neng Fan, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O.

In this paper, we are trying to give several models to describe the mathematical backgrounds of high-dimensional clustering, which will be the foundations of designing efficient algorithms.
