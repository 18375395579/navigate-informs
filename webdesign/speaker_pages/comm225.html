<br>Title: Models of Clustering of High-dimensional Microarray</br><br>Author: Neng Fan, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, andynfan@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Clustering, biclustering models have been studied a lot, but for high-dimensional clustering, only several algorithms have been given. In this paper, we are trying to give several models to describe the mathematical backgrounds of high-dimensional clustering, which will be the foundations of designing efficient algorithms.</br>
