Both dimensions lead to vexing unsolved problems. On the optimization side, we have stochastic dynamic network management problems for which there is little consensus on one best solution method. On the consumer behavior side, open problems include how to measure market response to prices, and what to do when there is little or no market information. Further concerns include model validation and how to include many important factors affecting consumer behavior.</br>
