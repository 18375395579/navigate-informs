Title: Heuristics for the Minimum-cost Ring-cover Problem<br>Author: Eli Olinick, Associate Professor, SMU, EMIS Department, PO Box 750123, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States of America, olinick@engr.smu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The minimum-cost ring-cover problem is an important and difficult optimization problem arising in the design of reliable, high-speed telecommunications networks. We present an integer-programming formulation for this problem and an empirical analysis of a  heuristic for solving it based on column generation.
