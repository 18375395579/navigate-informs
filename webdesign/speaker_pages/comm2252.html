Title: Global Optimization of MINLP Problems Containing Signomial Functions<br>Author: Tapio Westerlund, Professor, Abo Akademi University, Biskopsgatan 8, Turku, FIN-20500, Finland, tapio.westerlund@abo.fi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The techniques discussed are based on exact power transformations and the use of approximate inverse transformations, modeled by piecewise linear functions. By the transformations the non-convex MINLP problem can be transformed to convex form with a feasible region overestimating that of the original one. The optimal solution of the original problem is obtained by solving a sequence of convex sub-problems, in which new grid points in the PL functions are added in the subsequent problems.
