Title: High-performance Implementation of Positive Matrix Completion for SDPs<br>Author: Makoto Yamashita, Associate Professor, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1-W8-29, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan, Makoto.Yamashita@is.titech.ac.jp<br>Coauthor(s): Kazuhide Nakata<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: When SDPs (SemiDefinite Programs) have structural sparsity, the  positive matrix completion method can exploit the sparsity and reduce  the computation time.  Nakata et al. implemented SDPA-C by embedding  the completion method into the interior-point method.  We replace the  SDPA-C bottleneck with a more efficient formula due to  the property of the inverse of variable matrix.  Furthermore, with the  enhancement of multiple-threading, the new SDPA-C successfully solves  SDPs in a shorter time.
