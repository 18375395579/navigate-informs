We provide conditions for which our method closely approximates an equilibrium for large markets. We develop bounds that can assess accuracy for any given applied problem. Experiments show how our method greatly expands the set of economic problems that can be analyzed. As an example we consider a model of price competition with investments in quality.</br>
