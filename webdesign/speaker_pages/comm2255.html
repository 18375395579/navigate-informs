Title: Exact Algorithms for Multi-vehicle Production and Inventory Routing Problems<br>Author: Yossiri Adulyasak, HEC Montréal, 3000 Chemin de la Côte Ste-Catherine, Montreal, QC, Canada, yossiri.adulyasak@hec.ca<br>Coauthor(s): R Jans, Jean-François Cordeau<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The production routing problem and the inventory routing problem combine production/inventory decisions with vehicle routing decisions over many periods. Our research focuses on the multi-vehicle aspect which is often ignored in the literature. Two formulation schemes and a branch-and-cut algorithm are introduced and extensive computational results are provided.
