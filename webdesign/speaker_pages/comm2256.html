Title: Stochastic Network Retrofit with Recourse<br>Author: Changzheng Liu, Yueyue Fan, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Davis, czliu@ucdavis.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Our research explores retrofitting strategies for highway bridge networks considering uncertainties in natural and human-induced hazards, and their impacts. We formulate a 2-stage stochastic integer program with recourse that minimizes total system operation and recourse cost caused by nonanticipativity of random events. An L-shaped solution method and examples are presented.
