Title: In Which OPOs Should an End-stage Liver Disease Patient List?<br>Author: Gorkem Saka, PhD Candidate, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, gos2@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, Mark Roberts, Oguzhan Alagoz, Lisa Maillart<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Multiple listing refers to the practice where patients may join waiting lists in multiple OPOs. The important research question is where should a patient multiple list? By multiple listing, the patient in essence chooses a liver arrival matrix. We model this problem as a continuous-time MDP. We propose a modified branch-and-bound algorithm to optimally solve this decision problem where the problem to be solved at every iteration of the algorithm is an MDP.
