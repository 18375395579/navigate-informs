Title: A Bilevel Model for Media Pricing and Broadcasting<br>Author: Patrice Marcotte, Professor, University of Montreal, C.P. 6128, succursale centre-ville, Montreal, QC, Canada, marcotte@iro.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Nicolas Chan, Gilles Savard<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of jointly determining the price and schedule of  advertising spots faced by a media broadcaster, where customers are  heterogeneous with respect to their performance (audience) requests.  We propose a bilevel programming formulation of the problem, whose  difficulty comes from the presence of upper level constraints and discrete lower level variables. We analyze its structure, describe solution algorithms, and present numerical results.
