<br>Title: Parallel Optimization and the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization</br><br>Author: Todd Munson, Dr., Argonne National Laboratory, Mathematics and Computer Science Divisio, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States, tmunson@mcs.anl.gov</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We begin by presenting information on the design and implementation of the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO), and how the reuse of common optimization components is facilitated within the framework.  We then discuss the some of the algorithms bundled with TAO for solving complementarity and optimization problems.  Results for these methods are given along with an indication of their parallel performance.</br>
