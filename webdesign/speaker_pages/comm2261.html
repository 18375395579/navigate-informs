<br>Title: Community Detection in Networks: Global vs. Local Optimization</br><br>Author: Santo Fortunato, Associate Professor, Aalto University, Rakentajanaukio 2 C, Espoo, 02150, Finland, santo.fortunato@aalto.fi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Finding communities in networks is crucial to understand their structure and function, to identify the role of the nodes and uncover their hidden relationships. I will introduce global optimization methods, focusing on modularity optimization. I will highlight conceptual and technical problems of such techniques, like the presence of hidden scales, mostly due to underlying global null models. Local optimization methods do not suffer from these limitations and are potentially more suitable.</br>
