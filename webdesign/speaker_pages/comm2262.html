<br>Title: A Linear Programming Based Reinforcement Learning Algorithm</br><br>Author: Vivek Borkar, Professor, School of Technology and Computer Science,, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,, Homi Bhabha Road, Mumbai, Ma, 400005, India, borkar@tifr.res.in</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jervis Pinto, Tarun Prabhu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A new reinforcement learning algorithm for Markov decision processes is proposed, based on the dual linear program associated with it. A linear function architecture is used to approximate this linear program and the saddle point of the associated Lagrangian is learnt using a stochastic approximation version of a primal-dual scheme operating on two time scales. Convergence with probability one is established.</br>
