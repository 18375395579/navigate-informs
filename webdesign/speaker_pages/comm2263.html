<br>Title: Efficient Management of Demand Loads in Cloud Computing Environments</br><br>Author: Samyukta Sethuraman, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, samyukta@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Natarajan Gautam, Lewis Ntaimo</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Energy efficiency can be achieved in cloud computing environments by cleverly assigning applications to servers, routing requests to appropriate servers, and speed-scaling of servers. We formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes expected energy consumption subject to satisfying QoS constraints. We develop a hybrid model that combines a deterministic optimization model and a stochastic fluid flow analysis in a unified manner.</br>
