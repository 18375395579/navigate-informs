Title: A Constraint Store Based on Multivalued Decision Diagrams<br>Author: John Hooker, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, john@hooker.tepper.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Henrik Reif Andersen, Tarik Hadzic, Peter Tiedemann<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A typical domain store propagates a limited amount of information.  We propose a richer constraint store in the form of a limited-width multivalued decision diagram (MDD).  It reduces to a traditional domain store for width 1 but allows greater pruning of the search tree for larger widths.  We define MDD consistency as an extension of generalized arc consistency.  We propose specialized propagation algorithms for alldiff and inequality constraints and report computational experiments.
