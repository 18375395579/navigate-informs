We first show how these inequalities can be applied to the simplex tableaux of the LP relaxations of 0-1 MIPs. We then show how these inequalities can  be applied to the formulation of 0-1 MIPs and propose different separation algorithms. Finally we present the results of a computational study comparing the performance of these cuts on a family of randomly generated problems.
