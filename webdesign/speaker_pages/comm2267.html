Morrison, Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering, Central Michigan University, Department of Engineering and Technology, ET 147, Mount Pleasant, MI, 48859, United States, morri1j@cmich.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop linear programming throughput bounds for Markov chain models of closed queueing networks operating under affine index control policies. The approach employs surrogates for the differential cost function in an inequality relaxation of the average cost equation. The surrogates considered include piecewise quadratics on polyhedral regions of the state space. Our throughput bounds are tighter than those of some previous approaches and require less computation than exact solution.</br>
