Title: Procedure Room Allocation Decisions with Demand Uncertainty<br>Author: Bjorn Berg, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, MS 4A6, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, bberg2@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Urgent add-on procedures make planning and scheduling decisions difficult in outpatient procedure center settings. The decisions of dynamically allocating procedures to procedure rooms are modeled as a stochastic online bin-packing problem.  A special case is formulated as multi-stage stochastic integer program.  Results for optimal capacity management decisions are presented as well as results for easy-to-implement heuristics.
