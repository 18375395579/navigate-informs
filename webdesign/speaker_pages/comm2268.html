The decisions of dynamically allocating procedures to procedure rooms are modeled as a stochastic online bin-packing problem.  A special case is formulated as multi-stage stochastic integer program.  Results for optimal capacity management decisions are presented as well as results for easy-to-implement heuristics.</br>
