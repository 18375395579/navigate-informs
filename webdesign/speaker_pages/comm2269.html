<br>Title: Revenue Management with Limited Information: Managing Cancellations</br><br>Author: Yingjie Lan, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States, ylan@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball, Itir Karaesmen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We formulate the multi-fare, single-leg seat inventory control problem using limited information on demand and cancellation rates. We analyze the problem using competitive analysis of online algorithms. We determine the optimal overbooking pad as well as the optimal booking limits (i) to maximize the competitive ratio, and (ii) to minimize the maximum absolute regret. We present computationally efficient solution methods and discuss results of numerical experiments.</br>
