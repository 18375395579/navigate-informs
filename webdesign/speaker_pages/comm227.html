Title: SR0: A Simulation-based Algorithm for the CVRP<br>Author: Alejandro G. del Valle, University of La Coruña, Escuela Politécnica Superior, Avda. Mendizábal, s/n, Ferrol, C, 15403, Spain, agvalle@udc.es<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Capacitated VRP (CVRP) has been deeply studied during the last decades, and different metaheuristics (genetic algorithms or taboo search) have been developed. Most of these metaheuristics assume that the CVRP conditions are static. We present an algorithm, SR0, is a simulation-based approach to provide alternative solutions to the ones obtained using typical metaheuristics. These alternative solutions can be useful because they can consider multiple criteria to obtain the final decision.
