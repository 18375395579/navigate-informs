Title: Multiple Solutions for Two-phases MIP Decompositions<br>Author: Diego Olivier Fernandez Pons, Optimization consultant, ILOG, 1195 West Fremont Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA, United States of America, dofpons@ilog.com<br>Coauthor(s): Emilie Danna<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We use the solution pool feature of CPLEX 11 to solve two industrial  problems by decomposition. For a quadratic packing application, we use  a column generation approach to remove the quadratic constraints. For  a large-scale timetabling problem, we solve an approximation of  smaller size then the detailed allocation. By generating alternate  solutions in the first phase, we can focus on promising solutions and  still recover from an infeasibility if the first phase was too  optimistic.
