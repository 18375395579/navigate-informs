Title: A New Approach to Lifting General Integer Variables<br>Author: Todd Easton, Assistant Professor, Kansas State University, 237 Durland, Manhattan, KS, 66503, United States, teaston@ksu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Talia Gutierrez<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Lifting integer variables is a widely used technique to create strong cutting planes for integer programs.  In 1976 Wolsey introduced a technique to lift general integer variables.  The technique solves $u-l$ integer programs where $u$ and $l$ are the lower and upper bounds of the lifted variable. This talk presents a method to lift integer variables by solving a single integer program.  Some computational results will also be presented.
