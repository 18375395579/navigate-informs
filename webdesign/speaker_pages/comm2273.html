Title: Life-cycle Asset Allocation Using Stochastic Linear Programming<br>Author: Alexander Weissensteiner, University of Innsbruck, Dept. of Banking and Finance, Universitaetsstr. 15, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria, alex.weissensteiner@uibk.ac.at<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Hanke, Alois Geyer<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider optimal consumption and (strategic) asset allocation of an investor with uncertain lifetime in the context of time-varying investment  opportunities. The objective is to maximize the expected utility of consumption  over the lifetime and of bequest at the time of death of the investor. To solve  this problem we use a multi-stage stochastic linear programming (SLP) model. In  our numerical examples we first show that available closed-form solutions can  be accurately replicated with the SLP-based approach. Second, we add elements  to the problem specification which are usually beyond the scope of closed-form  solutions.
