Title: Performance Bounds and State-Relevance Weights for Approximate Linear Programming<br>Author: Daniela Pucci de Farias, pucci@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Theophane Weber, David Jeria<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The linear programming approach to approximate dynamic programming returns a solution that depends on the objective function coefficients, a result which contrasts with the case of LP for exact dynamic programming. In the general case of linear combination of features approximating the cost-to-go function, we prove the existence of objective coefficients ensuring an a priori bound on the quality of the resulting policy, in terms of the power of the approximation architecture.
