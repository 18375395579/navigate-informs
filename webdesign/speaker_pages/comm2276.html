<br>Title: On a Multiclass Spatial Equilibrium Problem</br><br>Author: Patrice Marcotte, Professor, University of Montreal, CP 6128, Succ. Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC, H3C3J7, Canada, marcotte@iro.umontreal.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michel Gendreau</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a multiclass extension of the spatial price equilibrium model, where each user class is characterized by  its value-of-time. We formulate the equilibrium conditions as an asymmetric and non-monotone variational inequality, for which we propose a decomposition framework that efficiently exploits the problem's structure, as is demonstrated on large-scale instances. Finally, we discuss the MPEC that consists in setting the prices of a leader firm in this context.</br>
