<br>Title: Solving Single-round, Fully Enumerated Combinatorial Truckload Procurement Auctions to Optimality</br><br>Author: Richard Chen, Ph.D. Student, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, richchen@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Damian Beil, Amitabh Sinha, Amy Cohn, Shervin AhmadBeygi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We apply an implicit bidding mechanism to optimally solve in a single round, a fully enumerated combinatorial truckload procurement auction. We present tractable network models for solving winner determination, with extensions for operational considerations. We demonstrate tractability via computational results for random instances of varying sizes, networks, and operational considerations.</br>
