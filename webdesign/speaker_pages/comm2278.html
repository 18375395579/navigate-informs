Title: Projective Preconditioners for Improving the Practical Performance of IPMs for Conic Programming<br>Author: Alexandre Belloni, MIT, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, belloni@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Freund<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The traditional strategy for speeding up the performance of IPMs for conic optimization problems has been to focus on pre-conditioners to try to improve the numerical performance of the equation system solved at each iteration. In contrast, we present a methodology for mapping the entire problem to one that is better behaved in order to actually reduce the number of IPM iterations that are required to solve the problem. We report our latest computational results.
