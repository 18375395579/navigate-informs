<br>Title: Optimal and Approximate Supplier Selection Mechanisms</br><br>Author: Mahesh Nagarajan, Asst. Professor, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, v6t 1z2, Canada, mahesh.nagarajan@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a class of supplier selection problems with non contractible attributes. We pose these problems as infinite dimensional L.P.s. Direct applications of duality fail in giving insights and solutions to these problems. We use techniques that are variants of inner approximations to solve for the optimal trading mechanism as well as to analyze the performance of heuristic methods. We prove convergence properties of such problems as well as insights that may be of practical relevance.</br>
