Title: A parametric integer programming algorithm for bilevel mixed integer programs<br>Author: Chris Ryan, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America, chris.ryan@chicagobooth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthias Koeppe, Maurice Queyranne<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider discrete bilevel optimization problems where the follower solves an integer program with a fixed number of variables. Using recent results in parametric integer programming, we present fixed-dimension polynomial time algorithms for pure and mixed integer bilevel problems.
