It can be formulated as countably infinite linear program (CILP), and recently, a simplex algorithm for the CILP was suggested. Given a desired accuracy epsilon, we show that the number of pivots of the simplex algorithm with a particular pivoting rule to achieve this accuracy is O(N^3S^2A log(N+log S)(log S)^4) where N=log(epsilon) and S and A are the number of states and actions, resp.</br>
