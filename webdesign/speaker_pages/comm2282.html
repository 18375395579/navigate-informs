Title: Grid Expansion Planning with Operations Modeling<br>Author: Russell Bent, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Mail Stop C933, P.O. Box 1663, Los Alamos, NM, United States of America, rbent@lanl.gov<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Grid expansion planning has become increasingly complex and challenging due to the integration of renewable generation, smart grid devices, and novel markets. These integrations make it important to include details of grid operations when planning (AC power flows, market models, controls, etc.) to avoid loop flows, negative prices, and other undesirable operations. We present a flexible algorithm for solving grid expansion planning problems that can accommodate more detailed operations models.
