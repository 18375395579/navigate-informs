Title: Production/Distribution Network Design with Inventory Decisions<br>Author: Burcu Keskin, Assistant Professor, University of Alabama, Culverhouse Business School, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States, bkeskin@cba.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Halit Uster<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a three-stage production/distribution network in which facility location and inventory decisions are integrated. We model the problem as a nonlinear mixed integer program, and develop efficient approaches for its solution. We also present computational results that illustrate the benefits of the integrated decision making.
