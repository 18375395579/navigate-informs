<br>Title: Lower Bounds on Line Location Problems via Demand Regions</br><br>Author: Robert Schieweck, University of Goettingen, Lotzestr. 16-18, Goettingen, 37083, Germany, r.schieweck@math.uni-goettingen.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anita Schoebel, Jack Brimberg</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We generalize the classical model of locating p lines in the plane in order to minimize the sum of norm distances to some demand points to be able to deal with demand regions of a certain kind. Algorithms to solve this problem to optimality are given. This yields lower bounds on the classical problem which can then be used in a branch-and-bound framework. For the special case of p parallel lines we present incidence criteria and an efficient algorithm.</br>
