Title: The Inverse Optimal Value Problem of Quadratic Programming<br>Author: Siming Huang, Professor, Inst. of Policy and Management, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, 100190, China, simhua@casipm.ac.cn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the inverse optimal value problem of convex quadratic programming problem. We show that in general it is a hard problem. For some special cases, it can be reduce to a semidefinite programming problem, therefore can solved efficiently. We will discuss its applications in machine learning and nonlinear classfication of data mining.
