Title: Optimizing Over the Split Closure<br>Author: Anureet Saxena, PhD Student, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, anureets@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Egon Balas<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The polyhedron defined by all the split cuts obtainable directly from the LP-relaxation P of a mixed integer program (MIP) is called the split closure of P. In this talk we address the problem of optimizing over the split closure and discuss computational results on a wide range of benchmark instances. It turns out that optimizing over this closure bridges on the average about 4/5 of the integrality gap of pure and mixed integer test instances.
