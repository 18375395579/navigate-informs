However, the problem of optimizing intensities of scanning spots has rarely been explored. We compare two classes of optimization models (linear programming and quadratic programming) by examining their resulting plan quality and delivery efficiency using clinical patient cases with different cancer sites, including head and neck, prostate, and lung.</br>
