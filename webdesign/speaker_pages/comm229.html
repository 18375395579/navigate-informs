<br>Title: The SCIP Optimization Suite 3.0 - It's all in the bag!</br><br>Author: Gerald Gamrath, Research Assistant, Zuse-Institut Berlin, Takustr 7, Berlin, 14199, Germany, gamrath@zib.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Timo Berthold, Ambros Gleixner, Stefan Heinz, Marc Pfetsch, Matthias Miltenberger, Thorsten Koch, Stefan Vigerske, Kati Wolter, Dieter Weninger, Yuji Shinano, Michael Winkler</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present the SCIP Optimization Suite, a tool for modeling and solving optimization problems.  It comes with the modeling language ZIMPL and the LP solver SoPlex and is one of the fastest MIP solvers available in source code.  Additionally, it can solve more optimization problems including non-convex MINLP and supports branch-and-price.  We report on current developments and new features in the 3.0 release,  including enhanced MINLP support, exact integer programming, and parallelization.</br>
