Title: An Integer Programming Model for Sensor Location Optimization on Freeway Corridors<br>Author: Henry Liu, University of Minnesota, 500 Pillsbury Dr., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, henryliu@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Adam Danczyk<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present an integer programming formulation and its solution algorithm for optimally locating aggregated-point sensors on freeway corridors for performance monitoring purposes, given budgetary constraints. The solution to the integer programming model is mathematically equivalent to solve a cost-constrained shortest path problem. This model can serve as a planning tool for sensor installments on corridors with or without existing sensor configurations.
