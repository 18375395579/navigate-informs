Title: Static Arbitrage Bounds for Basket Options via Linear Programming<br>Author: Juan Vera, Postdoctoral Fellow, Georgia State University, United States, jvera@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Luis Zuluaga, Javier Pena<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We show that the problem of finding the best possible bounds on a basket option given the prices of other basket options can be cast as a linear program. We subsequently show that for special cases, e.g., when only calls on individual assets are given, the linear programming formulation can be simplified substantially and has a closed-form solution.
