Title: Constrained Simulation Optimization on Integer-ordered Spaces<br>Author: Raghu Pasupathy, Associate Professor, Virginia Tech, 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, pasupath@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kalyani Nagarajan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We will present a simple extension to the algorithm R-SPLINE for constrained simulation optimization on integer-ordered spaces. The algorithm involves generating and solving a  sequence of sample-path problems that include both objective and constraint function estimators. Asymptotic results on consistency, feasibility, and convergence rates will be discussed. If time permits, we will present some numerical results.
