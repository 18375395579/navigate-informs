Title: Modelling the Hop-constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem Over a Layered Graph<br>Author: Luis Gouveia, CIO and DEIO-FCUL, Edifício C6, Campo Grande, Lisbon, Lx, Portugal, legouveia@fc.ul.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Eduardo Uchoa, Luidi Simonetti<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk we show that the Hop-constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem (HMSTP)   that can be viewed as Steiner Tree Problem (STP) in a layered graph. We present formulations that  correspond to well known formulations for the STP and here adapted for the layered graph and  compare the linear programming  relaxation of the new models with the linear programming relaxation of best models presented so far.  The so called Diameter Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree will also be mentioned.
