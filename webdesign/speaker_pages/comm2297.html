Title: On the Choice-Based Linear Programming Model for Network Revenue Management<br>Author: Qian Liu, Assistant Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Tech, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, qianliu@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Based on a customer-choice-based deterministic LP model (CDLP) for network RM proposed recently by Gallego et al., we explore applications of their model. We develop a decomposition heuristic to generate dynamic control policies, which is practically viable and significantly improves on the performance of the static CDLP. We also characterize optimal offer sets using a notion of “efficiency?and show only efficient sets are asymptotically optimal.
