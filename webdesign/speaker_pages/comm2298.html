Title: A Solution Methodology for the Stochastic Single-sector Traffic Flow Management Problem<br>Author: Yu-Heng Chang, yhchang@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John-Paul Clarke, Ellis Johnson, Senay Solak<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the stochastic single-sector traffic flow management problem, which determines the number of aircraft to send towards a sector and the recourse actions under the uncertainty of weather. The resulting stochastic programming problem is computationally intractable, and we propose a rolling horizon method that decomposes the problem by consecutively solving sub-problems with fewer flights and time periods.
