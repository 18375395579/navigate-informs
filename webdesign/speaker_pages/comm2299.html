Title: Multi-objective Optimization Via Parametric Programming: Models, Algorithms and Challenges<br>Author: Oleksandr Romanko, McMaster University, ITB-116, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, Canada, romanko@mcmaster.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Tamas Terlaky, Alireza Ghaffari-Hadigheh<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We highlight relationships between multi-objective optimization, where several conflicting objectives are simultaneously optimized subject to constraints, and parametric programming that is used to solve such problems. We present our Interior Point Method and optimal partition based algorithmic and implementation results for solving linear, convex quadratic and second-order cone parametric problems. We illustrate how to solve multi-objective problems and outline their applications in finance.
