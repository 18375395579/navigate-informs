<br>Title: Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming with CVaR Risk Constraints Applied to Hydrothermal Scheduling</br><br>Author: Luiz Carlos Costa Jr, PSR, Praia de Botafogo 228 / 1701-A, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22250-145, Brazil, luizcarlos@psr-inc.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mario Veiga Pereira, Sérgio Granville, Nora Campodonico, Marcia Fampa</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we present an extension of the SDDP algorithm to incorporate CVaR constraints on supply reliability. We show that these constraints can be represented as piecewise linear penalties on the energy not supplied, and develop an efficient algorithm to calculate the segment coefficients. The methodology will be illustrated with a realistic stochastic hydrothermal scheduling problem.</br>
