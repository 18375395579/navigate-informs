Title: Recent Progress in Gomory and Johnson's Infinite Group Relaxation<br>Author: Amitabh Basu, University of California-Davis, Davis, CA, United States of America, abasu@math.ucdavis.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The infinite group problem was introduced by Gomory and Johnson in the 70s as an elegant infinite dimensional abstraction of general integer programs. Since then it has played a very important role in the theory of deriving valid cutting planes for integer programming problems.  We review our recent results regarding extreme valid inequalities for the infinite group problem. A second goal of the talk will be to discuss some of the challenging open problems from this area.
