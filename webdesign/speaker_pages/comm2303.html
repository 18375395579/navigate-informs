Our implementation has interfaces for three open-source solvers: CBC, SYMPHONY, and GLPK.  We give examples to demonstrate the potential usefulness of these methods in understanding the progress of the algorithm, understanding differences between instances, and learning about branch-and-bound algorithms.</br>
