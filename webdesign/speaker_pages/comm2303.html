Title: Visualization Tools for Branch-and-bound Algorithms<br>Author: Brady Hunsaker, University of Pittsburgh, 1036 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, hunsaker@engr.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Osman Ozaltin, Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present methods to visualize the behavior of branch-and-bound algorithms.  Our implementation has interfaces for three open-source solvers: CBC, SYMPHONY, and GLPK.  We give examples to demonstrate the potential usefulness of these methods in understanding the progress of the algorithm, understanding differences between instances, and learning about branch-and-bound algorithms.
