Title: Stochastic Block Mirror Descent Methods for Nonsmooth and Stochastic Optimization<br>Author: Cong Dang, Ph.D. student, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, congdd@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guanghui Lan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose Stochastic Coordinate Descent algorithms (SCDA) for general convex and non-convex stochastic optimization. We also present the convergence analysis of SCDA for variant types of problems.
