Title: Probabilistic Constarints with Cumulative Random Right-hand Sides<br>Author: Miguel Lejeune, Assistant Professor, mlejeune@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study stochastic problems containing joint probabilistic constraints with cumulative random right-hand sides. We propose several reformulation approaches for this type of problems, analyze their properties and test their computational tractability.
