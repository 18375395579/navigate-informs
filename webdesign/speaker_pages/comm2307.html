This talk presents a robust and efficient online segmentation algorithm that can be easily applied to various time series using a data-driven decomposition strategy and a closed-form online updating formula. A set of skeleton-point-based features are proposed to characterize time series temporal patterns. Two real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</br>
