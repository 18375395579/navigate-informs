Title: Online Piecewise Linear Segmentation and Temporal Pattern Extraction of Time Series Data<br>Author: Art Chaovalitwongse, University of Washington, 3900 Stevens Way, Seattle, WA, United States of America, artchao@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shouyi Wang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Piecewise linear segmentation (PLS) is popular to monitor and summarize time series patterns online. This talk presents a robust and efficient online segmentation algorithm that can be easily applied to various time series using a data-driven decomposition strategy and a closed-form online updating formula. A set of skeleton-point-based features are proposed to characterize time series temporal patterns. Two real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
