Title: Nonlinear Mixed Integer Programming in Power Network Optimization<br>Author: Pavlo Krokhmal, University of Iowa, 3131 Seamans Center, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, krokhmal@engineering.uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bo Sun<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing power load distribution in networks, which reduces to non-linear mixed integer second order cone programming model. An algorithm based on cutting plane method for solving polyhedral approximations of the relaxed problem is proposed. Numerical case studies are presented.
