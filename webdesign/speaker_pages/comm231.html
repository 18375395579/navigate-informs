Title: Gap-driven Algorithms for the Dynamic User Equilibrium Problem on Large Networks<br>Author: Hani Mahmassani, Professor, The University of Maryland at College Park, Department of Civil & Environmental Engi, College Park, MD, 20742-3021, United States, masmah@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chung-Cheng Lu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Computational results on large networks are presented for alternative approaches to the MSA for simulation-based DTA models.  The approach is driven by minimizing a gap function,  and embeds (i) a simulation-based dynamic network loading model to capture traffic dynamics and determine experienced path travel costs for a given path flow pattern; and (ii) a path swapping-based descent direction method to solve the restricted NMP defined by a subset of feasible paths.
