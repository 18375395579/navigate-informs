Title: Leveraging a Flexible Framework for Agent-based Optimization<br>Author: John Siirola, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800  MS 0370, Albuquerque, NM, 87109-0370, United States of America, jdsiiro@sandia.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe ABO, an Agent-Based Optimization metaheuristic for asynchronous, parallel, hybrid optimization.  ABO leverages the open source Common Optimization Library INterface (COLIN) to integrate multiple, independent optimization algorithms into a single cohesive system for non-convex multi-objective optimization.  We will present some of the unique capabilities within COLIN that enable the rapid development of hybrid algorithms and the impact that flexible interfaces have on ABO development.
