Patients are characterized based on their probability of missing an appointment. To compensate this, scheduler overbooks the slots, thereby maximizing profit. Here we propose a numerical technique using a myopic policy for optimal performance. It involves computing multidimensional numerical integrations. As a special case, we propose a simplified approach when the service time distribution is gamma.
