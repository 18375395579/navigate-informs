Title: Improving Deterministic Bounds for Approximate Solutions to Stochastic Programs<br>Author: Alex Gose, Graduate Research Assistant, North Carolina State University, Operations Research Program, 2152 Burlington Labs, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, ahgose@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Methods based on aggregation of rows and columns can be used to find deterministic upper and lower bounds for stochastic programs with continuously distributed random problem parameters.  We discuss approaches for computing bounds in the context of a sequential algorithm with refinement on a partition of the support of the random problem parameters.  Computational results comparing these methods are provided to evaluate the efficiency and quality of the bounds.
