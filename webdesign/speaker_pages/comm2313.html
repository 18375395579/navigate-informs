Title: Enhanced Column Generation for Multiple-runway Aircraft Sequencing Problem<br>Author: Farbod Farhadi, Doctoral Student, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, 121 Presidents Drive, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, ffarhadi@som.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ahmed Ghoniem<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We address mixed mode multiple-runway aircraft sequencing problem. An MIP formulation is enhanced with valid inequalities and symmetry-defeating constraints. An alternative set partitioning problem is solved by column generation using multiple algorithmic features that accelerate the convergence and tighten the duality gap.
