Title: Robust Revenue Management<br>Author: Guillaume Roels, Assistant Professor, UCLA Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, 90077, United States, groels@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate the problem of allocating fixed capacity in a network to different classes of customers, with limited information about the demand distributions. We consider two criteria for decision-making under uncertainty: maximin and minimax regret. Our approach combines an efficient solution procedure, based on linear programming, with very modest requirements for data about the demand distributions, and is therefore scalable to solve real network revenue management problems.
