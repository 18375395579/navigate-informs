<br>Title: Dynamic Fleet Routing via Tabu Search</br><br>Author: Doug Popken, Systems View, 2127 Mountain Maple Avenue, Highlands Ranch, CO, United States of America, dpopken@systemsview.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Systems View is upgrading the intranet based route management system of an auto shipper client to include a dynamic route optimization capability.  Routes have complex capacity and timing constraints, with pickup and dropoff locations throughout the United States.  A prototype, using a series of insertion based heuristics, generated enthusiasm for more advanced algorithms.  This talk describes the development and deployment of a classic tabu search meta algorithm that guides the heuristics to producing sets of high-quality routes.</br>
