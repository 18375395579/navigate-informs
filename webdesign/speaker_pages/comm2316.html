<br>Title: Fixed-Dimensional Stochastic Dynamic Programs: An Approximation Scheme and an Inventory Application</br><br>Author: Wei Chen, University of Texas-Dallas, Richardson, TX, United States of America, wxc103020@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Milind Dawande, Ganesh Janakiraman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study fixed-dimensional stochastic dynamic programs in a discrete setting. Under the assumption that the cost-to-go functions are discrete L#-convex, we propose a pseudo-polynomial approximation scheme that  solves this problem to within an arbitrary pre-specified additive error.  The main technique we develop for obtaining our scheme is approximation of a fixed-dimensional L#-convex function on a bounded rectangular set, using only a selected number of points in its domain.</br>
