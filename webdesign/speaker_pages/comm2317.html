We formulate the problem as a 0-1 integer linear programming model and transform it to a 0-1 second-order cone program. A semidefinite relaxation is proposed, from which we get a lower bound. We also develop a heuristic approach to gain near optimal solutions for the problem. Some valid inequalities are added to reduce the gap between lower bound and objective value.</br>
