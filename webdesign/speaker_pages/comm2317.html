Title: SDP and SOCP based Method for the Robust Material Allocation Planning Problem<br>Author: Yuan Yuan, Phd, The Logistics Institute,Northeastern University, Shenyang, LN, 110819, China, yyuan.tli@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Lixin Tang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate a new type of material allocation problem, in which there is some uncertainty or variation in the parameters. We formulate the problem as a 0-1 integer linear programming model and transform it to a 0-1 second-order cone program. A semidefinite relaxation is proposed, from which we get a lower bound. We also develop a heuristic approach to gain near optimal solutions for the problem. Some valid inequalities are added to reduce the gap between lower bound and objective value.
