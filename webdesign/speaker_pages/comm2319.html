Engineering improvements are selected to limit the consequences of a range of potential hazard scenarios. A novel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used to search for nondominated and nearly-nondominated solutions with decision space diversity. The algorithm's effectiveness is shown on realistic data from a coastal community.</br>
