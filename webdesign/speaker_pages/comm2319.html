Title: A Multi-objective Approach to Improve Civil Infrastructure System Resilience Against Natural Hazards<br>Author: Brian Piper, North Carolina State University, 2500 Stinson Drive, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, piper.brian@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ranji Ranjithan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a framework to quantify multiple aspects of the resilience of a civil infrastructure system subjected to natural hazards. Engineering improvements are selected to limit the consequences of a range of potential hazard scenarios. A novel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used to search for nondominated and nearly-nondominated solutions with decision space diversity. The algorithm's effectiveness is shown on realistic data from a coastal community.
