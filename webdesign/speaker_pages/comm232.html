Title: Applying High Performance Computing to Multi Area Stochastic Unit Commitment for Wind Penetration<br>Author: Anthony Papavasiliou, University of California at Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, IEOR Department, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1777, United States of America, anthony.papavasiliou@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Our work is focused on the stochastic unit commitment problem applied to the case of large-scale renewable energy integration. We present a parallel implementation of a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm for solving the problem over a high performance computing cluster of 1000 servers. We investigate the sensitivity of our results on the number of scenarios that are used, compare the resulting policies with N-1 reliable unit commitment and present computational results on speedup and efficiency.
