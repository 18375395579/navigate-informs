Title: Bounds from Multiple Binary Decision Diagrams<br>Author: David Bergman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, dbergman@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Willem-Jan van Hoeve, J.N. Hooker, Andre Cire<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk we discuss the use of multiple Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) for the purpose of generating bounds to discrete optimization problems. Individual BDDs are used to generate relaxations for different portions of the problem. From each BDD we derive a flow polytope and then link the BDDs via variables associated with the layers of the individual BDDs. We apply the technique to the Maximum Independent Set and Vertex Coloring problems.
