Title: Uncertain Linear Programs: Extended Affinely Adjustable Robust Counterparts<br>Author: Xin Chen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S.

We demonstrate both  theoretically and computationally that our approach may  significantly outperform the affinely adjustable robust counterpart.  Similar to the affinely adjustable robust counterpart, our approach  ends up with deterministic optimization formulations that are  tractable and scalable to multi-stage problems.
