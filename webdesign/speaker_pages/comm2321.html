<br>Title: Uncertain Linear Programs: Extended Affinely Adjustable Robust Counterparts</br><br>Author: Xin Chen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Ave., Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, xinchen@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuhan Zhang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Wintroduce the extended affinely adjustable robust  counterpart to modeling and solving multi-stage uncertain linear  programs with fixed recourse. We demonstrate both  theoretically and computationally that our approach may  significantly outperform the affinely adjustable robust counterpart.  Similar to the affinely adjustable robust counterpart, our approach  ends up with deterministic optimization formulations that are  tractable and scalable to multi-stage problems.</br>
