<br>Title: Online Optimization of Radiotherapy Patient Scheduling</br><br>Author: Antoine Legrain, PhD Candidate, École Polytechnique Montréal, Pavillon Andr?Aisenstadt, Bureau 3520, 2920, Chemin de la Tour, Montréal, QC, H3T 1J4, Canada, antoine.legrain@polymtl.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nadia Lahrichi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: An efficient radiotherapy patient scheduling on the linear accelerators  is crucial to ensure the delivery of the treatment respecting all delays. Different contradictory objectives and constraints have to be taken into account.  We propose a hybrid algorithm using online and stochastic optimization. Online methods allow scheduling a patient whenever according to the preference of the user and stochastic tools authorize to infer the future in order to take into account prospective patients.</br>
