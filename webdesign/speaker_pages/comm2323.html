Title: Bidding Strategies for Generators in Electricity Markets Using an Endogenous Treatment of Prices<br>Author: Sebastian de la Torre, Assistant Professor, Universidad de Málaga, Departamento de Tecnología Electrónica, Universidad de Málaga, Málaga, 29071, Spain, storre@uma.es<br>Coauthor(s): Antonio J. Conejo, Steve Gabriel, Yohan Shim, Raquel Garcia-Bertrand<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: To maximize their profits, generators need to derive bidding strategies to participate in electricity markets. This presentation describes a procedure to derive such strategies for the day-ahead market, treating the clearing price as an endogenous variable. The proposed modeling results in a three-level mathematical programming problem; it is attacked using a novel Benders-based algorithm that considers the non-convexity of the problem. Market clearing is represented using KKT conditions.
