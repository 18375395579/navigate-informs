Boyd, Room 124, Norman, OK, 73071, United States of America, Emre.Tokgoz-1@ou.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A well known method to solve mixed variable optimization problems is by using interior point method. In this talk I will be introducing a new method to obtain mixed (i.e. discrete and continuous) convexity and optimization results for mixed variable functions with the corresponding algorithms.</br>
