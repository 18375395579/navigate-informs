Nick Street<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose methods of ensemble classification based on a new measure of distance between points. We map data points into a new space defined by the class probability estimates from a pool of two-class classifiers. Then, we use the Euclidean distance to measure the distance between data points in this space. We integrate this method with k-nearest neighbor procedures and KNORA in our experiments. Our findings show that our proposed method improves accuracy.
