J. Prabuchandran, Shalabh Bhatnagar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We address the problem of finding the best features in reinforcement learning with linear function approximation. Specifically, we consider TD(0) with linear function approximation for the infinite horizon discounted cost Markov decision process, wherein the number of `basis' features is fixed. The feature vectors are adapted on a slower time scale by using a gradient descent on the Grassmanian manifold. This involves explicit gradient computation based on the Edelman{Arias{Smith formula and a secondary  learning algorithm based on the same. Convergence properties of the combined scheme are established using two time scale stochastic approximation theory and the standard `limiting o.d.e.' approach to stochastic approximation. Simulation experiments show very good results.
