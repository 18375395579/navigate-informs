<br>Title: Supporting Special-needs Populations in Evacuation</br><br>Author: Lei Feng, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn L. Martin Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, lfeng@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elise Miller-Hooks</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this work, the use of paratransit fleets in the movement of persons with special needs to select shelter locations in a full-scale evacuation of a large urban area is considered. A mathematical model that seeks the optimal location of shelters along with the assignment of passengers to ridesharing vehicles and vehicles to tours is presented. A heuristic is presented for its solution. The solution method is illustrated on a real-world case study.</br>
