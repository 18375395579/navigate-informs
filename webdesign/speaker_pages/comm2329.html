Title: Lifting for Conic Mixed-integer Programming<br>Author: Alper Atamturk, University of California, 4175 Etcheverry Hall MC 1777, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, atamturk@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vishnu Narayanan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The lifting procedure has been shown to be very effective in developing  strong valid inequalities for linear integer programming and it has been  successfully used to solve such problems with branch-and-cut algorithms. Here we generalize the theory of lifting to conic integer programming, i.e., integer programs with conic constraints. We show how to derive conic valid inequalities for a conic integer program from conic inequalities valid for its lower-dimensional restrictions.
