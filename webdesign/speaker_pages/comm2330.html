Title: On the Complexity of Large-scale Convex Programming under a Linear Optimization Oracle<br>Author: Guanghui Lan, Assistant Professor, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, glan@ise.ufl.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a generic class of iterative optimization algorithms which can only perform linear optimization over the feasible region. We present the low complexity bounds for these algorithms, and establish the (near) optimality of the classic conditional gradient (CG) method under different cases. We also introduce some new variants of the CG method and demonstrate their advantages for solving certain convex optimization problems, e.g., those with box-type constraints.
