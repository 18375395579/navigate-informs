Title: Solving Max-k-Cut Problems Using Semidefinite Programming<br>Author: Bissan Ghaddar, PhD Candidate, University of Waterloo, Management Science Department University, of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, bghaddar@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Miguel Anjos, Frauke Liers, Angelika Wiegele<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk we present an algorithm for finding exact solutions for the Max-k-Cut problem known to be an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Our main contribution is the design of a branch-and-cut framework based on semidefinite programming combined with polyhedral results. We compare our method with other solution approaches and provide the most recent results for the Max-k-Cut problem.
