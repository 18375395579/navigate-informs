Title: A Stochastic Programming Model for the Feature Selection Problem<br>Author: Clara Novoa, Assistant Professor, Texas State University - San Marcos, 601 University Dr, San Marcos, TX, 78666, United States of America, cn17@txstate.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a stochastic programming model to address the feature selection problem.  A column generation approach is proposed to choose solutions that minimize the expected distortion and have subsets of features whose size is significantly lower than the original feature set.  Since the classification or clustering phase is a time consuming one, we study the feature selection problem sampling over subsets of the original data set.
