Title: Multi-stage Stochastic Capacity Expansion using Bender’s Decomposition with Sobol Sampling<br>Author: Mort Webster, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, mort@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Berk Ustun<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a multi-stage stochastic capacity expansion model for electricity generation, with uncertainty in future carbon limits, fuel prices, and technology capital costs.  Sobol sampling of the joint distribution of the uncertainty allows us to efficiently generate thousands of scenarios.  Using this approach, we demonstrate that the first-stage optimal mix depends critically on interactions between the uncertainties in policy, fuel prices, technology costs, and the time horizon.
