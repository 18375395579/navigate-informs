Title: Decision Diagrams for Discrete Optimization<br>Author: David Bergman, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, dbergman@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Hooker, Andre Cire, Willem-Jan van Hoeve<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we describe a decision diagram based branch-and-bound algorithm for discrete optimization problems. We discuss the application of the technique to several problems, including those that are often modeled with nonlinear terms.  Experimental results suggest that the algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art general purpose solvers.
