Curriculum<br>Author: Kim Needy, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, kneedy@engr.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bryan A. Norman, Mary Besterfield-Sacre, Jayant Rajgopal<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present two main ideas to synthesize and integrate O.R. concepts across the undergraduate I.E. curriculum: (1) The explicit use of techniques learned in a traditional O.R. course in other I.E. classes in the curriculum, and (2) An unstructured problem solving course where students work in teams and are required to integrate their O.R. skills with other techniques to address the problem.  We report on our observations based on two offerings of this class.
