Title: MPEC Approaches to Estimation of Pricing Games<br>Author: Che-Lin Su, Post-Doc Research Fellow, CMS-EMS, Kellogg School, Northwestern Univ, CMS-EMS, Kellogg School of Management, 580 Leverone Hall, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-2014, United States, c-su@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kenneth Judd<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimation of structural models is regarded as computationally difficult. This impression is due to a focus on the Nested Fixed-Point method. The NFXP approach is inappropriate for estimating games since it requires finding all Nash equilibria of a game for each parameter vector considered. We present an MPEC approach to the structural estimation problem. We illustrate with an example that the MPEC approach is immediately applicable to games with multiple equilibria.
