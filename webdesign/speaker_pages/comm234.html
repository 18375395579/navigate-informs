This impression is due to a focus on the Nested Fixed-Point method. The NFXP approach is inappropriate for estimating games since it requires finding all Nash equilibria of a game for each parameter vector considered. We present an MPEC approach to the structural estimation problem. We illustrate with an example that the MPEC approach is immediately applicable to games with multiple equilibria.</br>
