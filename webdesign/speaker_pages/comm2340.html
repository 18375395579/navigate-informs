Title: Quantitative Comparison of Approximate Solution Sets for Multicriteria Optimization Problems<br>Author: Esma Gel, Arizona State University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, esma.gel@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Murat Köksalan, John Fowler, Jyrki Wallenius<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider evaluating the quality of solution sets generated by heuristics for multiple-objective combinatorial optimization problems. We present and demonstrate the use of the integrated preference functional (IPF), which assigns a scalar value to a given discrete set of nondominated points. We present an exact calculation method for the IPF measure for an arbitrary number of criteria and demonstrate the use of IPF with two- and three-criteria numerical examples.
