Mgmt., 1 University Station, B6000, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, vivek.vasudeva@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anant Balakrishnan, Leon Lasdon<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This talk discusses a method that combines mixed-integer programming and local search to solve non-linear optimization problems.  The approach entails first solving a piecewise linear approximation to the original problem in order to obtain a solution that lies in the basin of attraction of the global solution, and then using this solution as a starting point for a local solver.  We discuss variants and enhancements of this approach and report results for selected non-convex non-linear problems.
