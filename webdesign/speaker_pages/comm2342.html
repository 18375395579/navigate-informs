<br>Title: On the Mixing Set with a Knapsack Constraint</br><br>Author: Ricardo Fukasawa, Associate Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, N2L3G1, Canada, rfukasaw@math.uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ahmad Abdi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the mixing set with a knapsack constraint, a substructure that appears when using integer programming reformulations for chance-constrained linear programs with random right-hand-sides.   We show that any polyhedral knowledge of the knapsack set can be translated into polyhedral knowledge of the given set. We  also comment on issues that arise when using our results to separate valid inequalities via linear programming  and propose solutions for them.</br>
