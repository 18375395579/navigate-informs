Addressing the matroid cogirth problem for linear matroids can lead to significantly enhancing the design process of sensor networks by providing a means to evaluate the quality of the network.  I briefly discuss existing methods developed to solve the matroid cogirth problem and the SCP.  Computational results are provided to validate a branch-and-cut algorithm that addresses the SCP formulation.</br>
