Title: Simplified Bidding and Solution Mechanisms for VCG Combinatorial Auctions<br>Author: Damian Beil, Assistant Professor, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, dbeil@bus.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amitabh Sinha, Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Combinatorial auctions?applicability in practice has been limited by the need for bidders to bid on an exponential number of bundles and for the auctioneer to solve an exponentially large winner-determination problem. We present a new bidding approach to address these challenges for a broad class of VCG combinatorial auctions. In our approach, the bidders' true-cost types are explicitly incorporated within a mathematical program that is used to solve the winner-determination problem.
