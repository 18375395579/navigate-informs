Title: A Nonlinear Integer Program for Vehicle-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment<br>Author: Chung-Cheng Lu, National Taipei University of Technology, 1 Section 3, Chung-Hsiao East Road, Taipei, Taiwan - ROC, jasoncclu@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Kuilin Zhang, Xuesong Zhou<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose an innovative nonlinear integer program for vehicle-based dynamic traffic assignment problems. The objective function is a vehicle-based gap function that measures the deviation from dynamic user equilibrium. This model describes dynamic traffic propagations and handles first-in-first-out requirements with a set of linear constraints. In addition, a set of time connectivity constraints provides facets of the convex hull, so the solutions of the LP relaxation of the integer program are almost always integral, and rounding heuristics or branch-and-bound are not required. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the integral property of the model.
