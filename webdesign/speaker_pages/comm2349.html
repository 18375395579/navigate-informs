Title: A Model for Heart Rate Regulation during Postural Change<br>Author: April Alston, PhD Student, North Carolina State University, Campus Box 8205, Raleigh, NC, 27695-8205, United States of America, avalston@unity.ncsu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Orthostatic stress tests, such as postural change from sit-to-stand, are common noninvasive procedures used to study short-term regulation of the cardio-respiratory system. In this talk, we present a mathematical model with 17 parameters that can predict the dynamics of heart rate regulation in response to orthostatic stress. To estimate the 17 unknown parameters, an inverse least squares problem was formulated and solved using the Nelder-Mead nonlinear optimization technique.
