Title: Conic Mixed-integer Programming with Bounded Integer Variables<br>Author: Vishnu Narayanan, University of California, Berkeley, IEOR Department, UC Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall (Mail Code 1777), Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, vishnu@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alper Atamturk<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present valid inequalities for conic mixed-integer programs with bounded integer variables via sequence independent lifting. We also analyze the special case of binary variables and present computational results on solving these problems.
