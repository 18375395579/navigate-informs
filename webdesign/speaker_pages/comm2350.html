Title: Robust Dynamic Hedging<br>Author: Zhenming Liu, Princeton University, 35 Olden street, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, zhenming@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Henry Lam<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a robust approach to the dynamic hedging of options by modeling the market as a repeated game between the nature and the investor. Based on a simple LP, we show the equivalence of the game to the binomial tree model when the option payoff is convex. For non-convex payoffs, the problem is in general #P-hard, and we design provably efficient approximation algorithm. We also consider the extension of our framework to markets with rare-event jump behavior.
