Title: Scalable Strategies for Stochastic Network Problems<br>Author: Nai-Yuan Chiang, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S. Cass Avenue, Lemont, IL, 60439, United States of America, nychiang@mcs.anl.gov<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The aim of this research is to demonstrate some more efficient approaches to solve the n-1 AC-SCOPF problems by using structure-exploiting primal-dual interior point methods.   A new contingency generation algorithm is presented, which starts with solving the basic OPF problem and then generates contingency scenarios dynamically during the solution process. Additionally, we also apply graph partitioning techniques to analyze the network behaviour and to decompose the network.
