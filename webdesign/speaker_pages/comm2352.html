Title: IPOPT, An Interior-Point Solver for Exploiting Structure in Large-Scale Nonlinear Programs<br>Author: Carl Laird, Graduate Student, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Chemical Engineering, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, United States, claird@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lorenz Biegler<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present the next-generation IPOPT, a large-scale interior-point solver for nonlinear programming problems available through the COIN-OR foundation (projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt). The algorithm performs all fundamental operations through a well-defined linear algebra interface. This allows development of specialized linear algebra for the efficient solution of structured problems without changes to the algorithm code. The approach will be demonstrated on a multi-scenario optimization problem.
