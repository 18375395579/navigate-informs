Title: Partial Objective Function Inequalities for the Multi-Item Capacitated Lot-Sizing Problem (MCLSP)<br>Author: Esra Buyuktahtakin, Assistant Professor, Wichita State Universiy, Wichita, KS, United States of America, esra.b@wichita.edu<br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith, Joseph Hartman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We derive valid bounds on the partial objective function of the MCLSP formulation via dynamic programming and integer programming techniques. We then develop algorithms for strengthening these valid inequalities by back-lifting binary and continuous variables. These inequalities are utilized in a cutting-plane strategy, in which we perturb the partial objective function coefficients for the MCLSP polytope. We present computational experiments with the proposed valid inequalities.
