The linear programming relaxation of the uncapacitated fixed-charge network design model is weak. We propose generalized network inequalities valid for fixed-charge network design polyhedron that contain the known network inequalities as special cases. We implement a branch-and-cut algorithm to show the effectiveness of the proposed inequalities.</br>
