Title: On Uncapacitated Fixed-charge Network Design Polyhedron<br>Author: Simge Kucukyavuz, University of Arizona, Systems and Industrial Engineering, Tucson, AZ, United States of America, simgek@gmail.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The fiber-optic cables in communications networks have large enough capacity to route the demands that result in uncapacitated network design problems. The linear programming relaxation of the uncapacitated fixed-charge network design model is weak. We propose generalized network inequalities valid for fixed-charge network design polyhedron that contain the known network inequalities as special cases. We implement a branch-and-cut algorithm to show the effectiveness of the proposed inequalities.
