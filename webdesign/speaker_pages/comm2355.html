Title: A Novel Library of Nonlinear Mixed-Integer and Disjunctive Programming Problems<br>Author: Nicolas Sawaya, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Chemical Engineering, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, United States, nws@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a new collection of mixed-integer and disjunctive nonlinear programming problems that arise in the fields of Operations Research, Chemical Engineering and Finance. These problems, which total over 250 and are organized into 15 classes of applications, span areas such as facility layout, synthesis of process networks, chemical batch process design, water networks and portfolio optimization. These problems are available at the following webpage: http://egon.cheme.cmu.edu/ibm/page.htm
