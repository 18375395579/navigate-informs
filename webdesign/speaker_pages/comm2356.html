<br>Title: Distributionally Robust Optimization under Moment Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Erick Delage, Stanford University, Packard 069, Stanford, CA, United States of America, edelage@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yinyu Ye</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Solutions to stochastic programs can be misleading when there is ambiguity about the distribution of random parameters. We propose a model which accounts for uncertainty in both the form and the moments of this distribution while remaining tractable for a wide range of objective functions. In fact, frequentist arguments, which rely on new confidence regions for covariance matrices, provide statistical guarantees when the model is applied to data-driven problems (e.g. portfolio optimization).</br>
