Title: Integrated Location, Routing and Scheduling Problems: Models and Algorithms<br>Author: Zeliha Akca, PhD candidate, Lehigh University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, zea2@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rosemary Berger<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the problem of determining the locations of capacitated facilities within a distribution network; deliveries are made along multiple stop routes and multiple routes may be assigned to the vehicles, which have capacity and time restrictions. We develop a set-partitioning-based formulation and identify valid inequalities. We develop a branch-and-price algorithm to solve instances of the problem and present computational results.
