The traditional approach is simulation-optimization whose computational costs are prohibitive for large systems. We develop a two-phase stochastic optimization approach that combines analytical and simulation methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our solution approach provides a reduction of several orders of magnitude in computational costs over traditional simulation-optimization.</br>
