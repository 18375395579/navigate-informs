Title: Optimal Capacity Management and Planning in Services Delivery Centers<br>Author: Aliza R. Heching, IBM TJ Watson Research Center, Mathematical Sciences, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, ahechi@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Squillante<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider optimal capacity management of systems of queues that arise in services delivery centers. The traditional approach is simulation-optimization whose computational costs are prohibitive for large systems. We develop a two-phase stochastic optimization approach that combines analytical and simulation methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our solution approach provides a reduction of several orders of magnitude in computational costs over traditional simulation-optimization.
