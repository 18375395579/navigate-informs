Title: Network Message-passing Algorithms<br>Author: Devavrat Shah, Assistant Professor, MIT, 32-D670, 77 Massachussets Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, devavrat@MIT.EDU<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: I will present message-passing algorithms for network scheduling and resource-allocation building on a simple summation algorithm. Key features of the algorithms are their simplicity, iterative nature and robust againt network dynamics.
