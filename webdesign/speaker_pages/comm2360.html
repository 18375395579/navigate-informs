We suggest an approach inspired by CP global constraints that use deterministic finite automata (DFA) and grammars to formulate constraints on sequences of variables in a MIP model. Experimental results on both approaches show that they can not only facilitate the modeling, but also give models easier to solve by LP solvers compared to classical MIP formulations.</br>
