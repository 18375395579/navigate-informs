Title: Formal Languages for Integer Programming Modeling<br>Author: Louis-Martin Rousseau, Associate Professor, École Polytechnique de Montréal, CP 6079 Succ Centre Ville, Montréal, QC, H3C 3A7, Canada, louis-martin.rousseau@polymtl.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Marie-Claude Cot?, Claude-Guy Quimper, Bernard Gendron<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper approaches the problem of modeling optimisation problems containing constraints on sequences of decision variables. We suggest an approach inspired by CP global constraints that use deterministic finite automata (DFA) and grammars to formulate constraints on sequences of variables in a MIP model. Experimental results on both approaches show that they can not only facilitate the modeling, but also give models easier to solve by LP solvers compared to classical MIP formulations.
