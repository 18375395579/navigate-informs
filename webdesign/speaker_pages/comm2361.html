Title: MIP Approaches to Joint Chance-Constrained Programs with Random Technology Matrices<br>Author: Matthew Tanner, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, mtanner@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A joint chance-constrained program with discretely distributed  random parameters can be reformulated as an MIP. We present two  methods for solving this problem to optimality and give  computational results. The first method is a new class of cutting  planes called IIS cuts, which are derived from irreducibly  infeasible subsets of the constraints of the problem. The second  method is a metaheuristic based on a reformulation of the problem  that has a finite number of feasible solutions.
