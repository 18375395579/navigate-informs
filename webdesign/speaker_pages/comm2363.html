<br>Title: Lifted Cuts for Box Constrained Quadratic Programming with Indicators</br><br>Author: Hongbo Dong, Postdoc, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 330 North Orchard Street, Madison, WI, 53705, United States of America, hdong6@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Linderoth, Hyemin Jeon</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the box constrained quadratic programs with binary indicators that act as on/off switch for each continuous variable. This structure appears in many MINLPs. We show how  PSD cuts for box constrained quadratic programs can be lifted to include binary indicators. Further we show the separation problem for the related class of lifted concave QPB cuts can be solved via Semidefinite Programming. Finally we explore strategies to use these cuts in practice.</br>
