Title: Global Optimization of Problems with Edge-concave Intermediates<br>Author: Yash Puranik, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, ypp@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Aida Khajavirad, Nick Sahinidis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We describe a branch-and-cut implementation that relies on a highly efficient solution of linear separation problems  for obtaining facet defining cuts for edge-concave functions. Standard test libraries are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
