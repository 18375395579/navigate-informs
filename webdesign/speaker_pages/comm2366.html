A hierarchical model involving batching, assignment and scheduling for an chemical process application will be described and new tools for its solution will be outlined.  In particular, the use of the GAMS/grid interface, the condor resource manager, and a variety of mixed integer programming solvers, coupled with domain expertise will be demonstrated.</br>
