<br>Title: Revenue Management Heuristics Under Limited Market Information: A Maximum Entropy Approach</br><br>Author: Serkan Eren, PhD Student, Columbia Business School, 435 West 119th Stree Apt. 3F, New York, NY, 10027, United States, se2027@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Costis Maglaras</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a tractable and intuitive approach based on maximum entropy (ME) distributions for revenue optimization problems in settings where firms have limited and/or censored market information. In this talk we illustrate the approach in the context of the single-resource capacity control problem, benchmarking it against other solutions based on some form of worse-case analysis, and showing how it can incorporate censored sales data in an intuitive manner and avoid the spiral-down phenomenon</br>
