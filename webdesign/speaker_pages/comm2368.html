In the process, we derive a convex extensions result applicable to large classes of nonlinear knapsacks and a convexification tool for orthogonal disjunctions. Applications to factorable programs are discussed. The results are specialized and refined for bilinear covering sets and preliminary computational results on strength of these relaxations are presented.
