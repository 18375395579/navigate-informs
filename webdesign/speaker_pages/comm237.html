Title: Optimal Decision-making between Signalized and Uninterrupted Flow Strategies during Evacuation<br>Author: Zhenke Luo, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, P.O. Box 784, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States of America, zluosr@uwm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yue Liu, Jing Mao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper presents a bi-level network optimization model to determine the optimal set of intersections in the evacuation network for implementing uninterrupted flow and signal control strategies, respectively, which can yield the maximum evacuation operational efficiency and the best use of available budgets. The proposed model is solved by a GA-based heuristic.
