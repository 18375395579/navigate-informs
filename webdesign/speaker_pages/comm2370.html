Title: The OSInstance Application Programming Interface for Optimization Problem Instances<br>Author: Robert Fourer, Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States, 4er@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kipp Martin, Jun Ma<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: As a complement to our proposal for OSiL, a new XML-based representation for optimization problem instances, we propose OSInstance, an in-memory representation. An open-source library provides application programming interfaces for reading and writing OSiL and OSInstance and for converting between them. This arrangement allows the two standards to be defined by a single design, yet offers diverse “get?methods for extracting data from OSInstance objects in a variety of convenient ways.
