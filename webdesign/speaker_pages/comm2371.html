Title: Test-and-prune: A Parallelized Algorithm for Solving Bi-level Optimization Problems<br>Author: Amy Cohn, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States of America, amycohn@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Duncan Callaway, Oleg Gusikhin, Richard Chen, Ada Barlatt<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We have recently developed a new algorithm, Test-and-Prune, for solving a broad class of bi-level optimization problems. In this talk, we extend this algorithm to take advantage of parallel computing resources. Examples are given from a range of application areas.
