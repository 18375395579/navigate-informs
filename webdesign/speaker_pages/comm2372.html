<br>Title: An Interior-point Approach using a Primal-dual Augmented Lagrangian for Large-scale Nonconvex Optimization in SAS</br><br>Author: Joshua Griffin, SAS Institute, Inc., United States of America, jdgriffi@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: SAS has recently developed and implemented multi-threaded Krylov-based interior-point and active set methods for large-scale nonconvex optimization.  Both methods use the exact primal dual augmented Lagrangian merit function of P. E. Gill and D. Robinson.  In this talk we focus on the interior-point approach and will give some numerical results to demonstrate nice features about this approach and discuss some strategies used for improving convergence.</br>
