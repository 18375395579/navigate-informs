Title: Iterative Solvers for Cone Complementarity Problems: Applications to Large-scale Rigid Body Dynamics<br>Author: Mihai Anitescu, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States of America, anitescu@mcs.anl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Alessandro Tasora<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss the resolution of optimization subproblems with conic constraints that appear in time-stepping schemes for rigid body dynamics. We present a Gauss Seidel like iteration and prove that it is globally convergent. We demonstrate that the method scales well, that it is very competitive for the simulation of granular flow dynamics and that it benefits from parallel implementation using a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) coprocessor.
