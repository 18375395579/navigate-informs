We present a Gauss Seidel like iteration and prove that it is globally convergent. We demonstrate that the method scales well, that it is very competitive for the simulation of granular flow dynamics and that it benefits from parallel implementation using a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) coprocessor.</br>
