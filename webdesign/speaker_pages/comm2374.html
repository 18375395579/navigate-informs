Title: Scenario Analysis: A Tool for Enhancing the Mission Means Framework<br>Author: Philipp Djang, Army Research Laboratory, Survivability/Lethality Analysis Directorate, ATTN:: AMSRD-ARL-SL-EI, White Sands Missile Range, NM, 88002, United States, philipp.djang@us.army.mil<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The goal of this project is to develop a hierarchical mathematical program for the Mission and Means Framework. Based on scenario analysis, we propose a optimization model whose purpose is to construct a force that is robust across several conflicts and theatres for a given time horizon and against multiple threats which may or may not undergo modernization/adaptation. The mathematical program will optimize force survivability.
