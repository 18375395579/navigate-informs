We solve the normal equations with a reduced matrix, H + A'_Q diag(z/s)_Q A_Q, for a well chosen index set Q (adaptively shrunk) thus reducing the computational cost per iteration by a factor close to |Q|/m.  We prove global, and local quadratic, convergence. We apply our scheme to support vector machine (SVM) training  (primal QP formulation), with highly promising results.</br>
