Title: Optimizing Beam Sequence for IMRT Planning<br>Author: Gino Lim, Assistant Professor, University of Houston, 4800 Calhoun Road, E211, Engineering Building 2, Houston, TX, 77204, United States, ginolim@uh.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a Beam Sequencing Problem (BSP) for IMRT planning. Given a fluence map, we aim to decompose the non-homogeneous beam intensity map into several (finite) number of beam shapes such that each beam will have a uniform intensity. It is known that solving BSP is NP-hard. We reformulate this problem as an optimization problem to minimize the final error between the fluence map and the results from the decomposition. We believe that this approach is much more practical for practioners.
