Title: A Benders Method for Solving Stochastic Complementarity Problems with an Application in Energy<br>Author: David Fuller, Professor, University of Waterloo, Department of Management Sciences, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, dfuller@engmail.uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Steve Gabriel<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a Benders decomposition method to solve stochastic complementarity problems. The master and subproblem are complementarity problems that are solved iteratively until a convergence gap is sufficiently close to zero. As well as details of the method, numerical results are provided, based on an electric power market model of Hobbs [2001] but with added stochastic elements. The results validate the approach and indicate dramatic improvements in solution times.
