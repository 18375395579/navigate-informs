Hard margin loss formulations that minimize the number of misclassified instances are proposed to model a more robust representation of outliers. Due to NP-hardness of the problem, we develop a three-phase heuristic algorithm for larger problems. Computational results show that the proposed method provides better cross validation accuracy compared to hinge loss formulation.</br>
