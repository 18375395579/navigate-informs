Title: Robust Control for the Multiarmed Bandit Problem<br>Author: Felipe Caro, University of California-Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States of America, fcaro@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Aparupa Das Gupta<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty in the estimated transition probabilities for the Multiarmed Bandit problem. We define the equivalent to the Gittins index in the robust setting but we show that it is not always optimal. We propose a heuristic to solve the problem which is faster by a constant factor than the robust index policy evaluation.
