<br>Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming for Battery Purchase and Charging at Swap Stations</br><br>Author: Frank Schneider, PhD Candidate, University of Cologne, Albertus-Magnus-Platz, Department for SCM & Mgmt. Science, Cologne, 50923, Germany, frank.schneider@uni-koeln.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diego Klabjan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We formulate and solve the decision problem of the number of batteries to have in circulation at a battery swapping stations. This also entails the decision making about how many batteries to start charging in each time period. Demand for battery swapping and prices of electricity are stochastic. We propose an algorithm combining classical optimization and approximate dynamic programming. We also provide a numerical study.</br>
