The strength of the proposed approach relies on the fact that the branching constraints match the conflicting constraints, thus preserving the structure of the subproblems after branching. We provide an efficient algorithm where proper data structures are used, warm starting is exploited and valid inequalities are generated for the subproblems.</br>
