Title: Dynamic Programming Based Inequalities for the Multi-Item Capacitated Lot-sizing Problem<br>Author: Esra Buyuktahtakin, PhD Candidate, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, iesra@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Hartman, J. Cole Smith<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Iterative solutions of dynamic programming formulations for the CLSP are used to generate valid inequalities for the integer programming formulation of its multi-item version. The inequalities essentially capture convex and concave envelopes of intermediate-stage value functions, and can be lifted by examining potential state information at future stages. A set of experiments are presented to illustrate the computational efficiency of the inequalities.
