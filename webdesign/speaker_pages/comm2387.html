The problem can be formulated as a disjunctive program over the set of p-efficient points, and is solved with a branch and bound algorithm. In this paper, we give a novel MIP formulation of the probability constraint using only few additional variables. This approach overcomes the exponential enumeration of p-efficient points.</br>
