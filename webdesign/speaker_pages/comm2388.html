Title: Column Generation for Large-scale MIP Reformulations<br>Author: Bernard Gendron, Universit?de Montréal, C.P. 6128, succ. Centre-ville, Montréal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada, Bernard.Gendron@cirrelt.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Antonio Frangioni<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a general column generation algorithm to solve large-scale models that arise from well-known reformulation techniques in MIP, such as discretization and disaggregation. We compare this algorithm with the standard Dantzig-Wolfe method and show computational results on various instances of the multicommodity capacitated network design problem.
