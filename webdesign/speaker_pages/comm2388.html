Centre-ville, Montréal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada, Bernard.Gendron@cirrelt.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antonio Frangioni</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a general column generation algorithm to solve large-scale models that arise from well-known reformulation techniques in MIP, such as discretization and disaggregation. We compare this algorithm with the standard Dantzig-Wolfe method and show computational results on various instances of the multicommodity capacitated network design problem.</br>
