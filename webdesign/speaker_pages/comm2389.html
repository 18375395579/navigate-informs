Title: Solving Defender-attacker-defender Models for Defending Critical Infrastructure<br>Author: Kevin Wood, Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, operations research department, monterey, ca, United States of America, kwood@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pablo Alvarez<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe defender-attacker-defender models (Stackelberg games) to plan the optimal defense of infrastructure from intelligent attack, and describe and compare four decomposition algorithms for their solution: direct, nested, reformulation-based, and reordering-based.  Computational tests on a canonical problem, “defending the shortest path,?show the second and third algorithms to be fastest.
