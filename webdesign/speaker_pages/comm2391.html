Title: A Lagrangian Inspired Discriminatory Pricing Algorithm<br>Author: Steven Harrod, Assistant Professor, University of Dayton, School of Business Administration, 300 College Park, Dayton, OH, 45469, United States of America, a2soft@aol.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A Lagrangian relaxation where multipliers are decomposed by  variable class as well as constraint, and updated by a discriminatory pricing algorithm, can produce feasible solutions to problems which would otherwise be very hard to solve. Lagrangian multipliers are indexed both by the constraints to be relaxed and the separable classes of conflicting variables. The algorithm is demonstated on a railway scheduling problem, a form of binary multicommodity flow.
