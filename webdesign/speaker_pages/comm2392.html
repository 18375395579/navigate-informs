Title: Optimized Underground Production Scheduling with Ventilation Constraints<br>Author: Andrea Brickey, Colorado School of Mines, 1500 Illinois Street, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, abrickey@mymail.mines.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Underground mines have been subjected to increasing restrictions on diesel particulate matter associated with the exhaust produced by the internal combustion engines of diesel-fueled mining equipment.  We present a mixed integer nonlinear optimization model to schedule production for a large-scale underground gold mine with the objective of maximizing discounted metal extraction. Constraints include typical (linear) precedence and resource capacities, and also incorporate nonlinear air flow.
