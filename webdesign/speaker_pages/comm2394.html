Title: Fast Fourier Optimization<br>Author: Robert Vanderbei, Professor, Princeton University, 209 Sherrerd Hall, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, rvdb@princeton.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Many optimization problems involve constraints on a Fourier Transform. The fast Fourier transform (fft) is a recursive algorithm that dramatically improves the efficiency for computing FTs. However, to invoke an fft subroutine within an LP problem means to forego access to  derivatives--a big disadvantage.  I will explain the idea behind the fast Fourier transform and show how to adapt it as explicit constraints in an LP. I will then briefly demonstrate with a problem in high-contrast imaging.
