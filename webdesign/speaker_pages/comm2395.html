Title: Integration of Causal Models and Set-covering Algorithms for Optimal Sensor Allocation<br>Author: Jing Li, Assistant Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States of America, jinglz@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper develops a method to transfer optimal sensor allocation in Distributed Sensor Networks into a set-covering optimization problem. An algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution by integrating causal Bayesian networks with a greedy search. Case studies are presented.
