<br>Title: Cardinality Constrained Linear Program: Facial Disjunctive Formulation and Valid Inequalities</br><br>Author: Jinhak Kim, Purdue University, 403 W State st. Room B031A, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, kim598@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mohit Tawarmalani, Jean-Philippe Richard</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We use a ratio of multilinear terms as product factors to generalize RLT to problems with cardinality constraints. Using this approach we develop relaxation schemes that converge to the convex hull of solutions when the feasible region is compact. We also consider specially structured problems such as cardinality constraint with a single linear constraint. We develop valid inequalities using lifting techniques. We identify conditions under which these inequalities are facet-defining.</br>
