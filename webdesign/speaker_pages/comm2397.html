Title: New Features of the AMPL Constraint Programming Interfaces<br>Author: Victor Zverovich, AMPL Optimization Inc, 1732 Anza Street, Apt 4, San Francisco, CA, United States of America, viz@ampl.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The AMPL modeling system now provides interfaces to several constraint programming solvers: IBM/ILOG CP Optimizer, Gecode and JaCoP. These interfaces have been updated to allow getting multiple solutions in a unified way, using variable attributes (suffixes) to control branching and defining table constraints. Also some special cases of logical constraints in AMPL are mapped to more efficient representations in CP solvers.
