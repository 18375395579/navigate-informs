In the proposed framework, DR aggregators actively correspond with ISO and customers for maximizing DR. The DR aggregators utilize the proposed price-based self-scheduling model to optimize the DR offers. The ISO clears the day-ahead energy market considering energy offers of generating units and load reduction offers of DR aggregators. The ISO’s and aggregators?models are formulated as MILP problems.</br>
