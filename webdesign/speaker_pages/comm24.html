Demand is stochastic and unmet demand is assumed to be lost. We show that an uncapacitated transformed problem is L-nature-convex.  We also provide an upper bound of the optimal solution for the original capacitated problem and a new algorithm to search for near-optimal solutions. The effectiveness of the algorithm is tested via numerical examples.</br>
