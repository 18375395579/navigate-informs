Title: Split Cuts and Extended Formulations for Second-order Conic Programming<br>Author: Sina Modaresi, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, sim23@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Kilinc, Juan Pablo Vielma<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study split cuts for second-order conic programming and introduce several extended formulations to which we can add the split cuts. We show how using an extended formulation might provide an advantage on generating cuts. We also compare the computational effectiveness of the split cuts and conic mixed-integer rounding cuts proposed by Atamturk et al. on different extended formulations.
