Title: Improving Electricity Market Operations to Accommodate Renewable Energy Using Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Canan Uckun, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S. Cass Avenue, Lemont, IL, 60439, United States of America, canan@anl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Audun Botterud, John Birge<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The expansion of renewable resources creates more uncertainty and variability in the operation of the power grid. The goal of this project is to develop novel stochastic formulations for commitment and dispatch of supply and demand resources considering the uncertainty in renewable energy. We investigate the potential benefits of stochastic programming compared to deterministic formulations. Our objective is to develop an efficiently solvable framework by using appropriate decomposition methods.
