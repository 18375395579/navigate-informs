More generally, the vector a should be approximated with a combination of k integral vectors.    We prove a bound on the quality of the approximaton, and as a corollary we show in subset sum problems with sufficiently large norm of the left hand side for almost all right hand sides the problem has a simple proof of infeasibility.</br>
