<br>Title: Parameter Choice in Sample-path Algorithms for Root Finding and Optimization</br><br>Author: Raghu Pasupathy, Virginia Tech, 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, United States of America, pasupath@vt.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Retrospective Approximation is a sample-path technique that solves stochastic root-finding and simulation-optimization problems through a sequence of approximate, and increasingly accurate, deterministic problems. In this talk, we provide guidance on choosing sample sizes and error tolerances in such algorithms. Specifically, we characterize a class of parameter sequences that are superior to others in a certain precise sense. We also identify and recommend particular members of this class.</br>
