Title: A Mixed Integer Programming Formulation to Balance a Dynamic Production Line with Discrete Tasks<br>Author: Natasa Vidic, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, nav9@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bryan Norman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this research we focus on a serial production environment with dynamic worksharing, similar to bucket brigade systems. We develop a mixed integer programming formulation that models one-cycle balanced line behavior where workers exchange parts at exactly one position. This formulation is extended to incorporate multiple production lines. We also developed a two-cycle formulation that models a condition when workers exchange parts at exactly two positions in a periodic manner.
