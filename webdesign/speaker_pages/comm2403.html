We develop a mixed integer programming formulation that models one-cycle balanced line behavior where workers exchange parts at exactly one position. This formulation is extended to incorporate multiple production lines. We also developed a two-cycle formulation that models a condition when workers exchange parts at exactly two positions in a periodic manner.</br>
