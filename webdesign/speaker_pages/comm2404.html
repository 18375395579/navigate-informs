Snyder</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a network interdiction model in which a smuggler uses a network of roads and an interdictor deploys patrol units to increase the smuggler’s cost of using particular roads. We heuristically reformulate the smuggler’s problem, which is a prize-collecting Steiner tree problem, and solve the interdictor’s problem as a single-level mixed-integer program.</br>
