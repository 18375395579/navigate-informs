The explicit optimization formulation incorporates, inter alia, stiffness correlation among all structural members via finite element analysis and complementarity constraints to model nonlinear material response.  Optimal sizing and reinforcing for beam and column members in multi-bay and multi-story RC structures result in cost savings over typical-practice design solutions.</br>
