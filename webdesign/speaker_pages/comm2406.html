Several solution representations are generally possible for each problem, with various implications for solution quality and running time. Through the use of Condor (a high throughput computing solution) and over 250,000 CPU hours, we are able to explore a new solution representation designed for flexible flow line scheduling (extensions to other problems are easily conceived).</br>
