Title: Computational RM for Online Ad Allocation<br>Author: Dragos Florin Ciocan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 100 Main Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, ciocan@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vivek Farias<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present an algorithmic and computational methodology for Generalized Second Price online ad allocation. We show that, even with arbitrarily high user traffic volatility, a scheme that resolves a sequence of LPs achieves provable performance guarantees. Motivated by this, we present a distributed algorithm for solving massively large allocation LPs, together with an implementation of our algorithm. We prove the value of our implementation with an experiment on a real life ad dataset.
