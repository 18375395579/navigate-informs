Title: Cost Scaling for the Traffic Assignment by Successive Approximation<br>Author: Hong Zheng, University of Arizona, Tucson, United States of America, hzheng@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a successive approximation algorithm to solve the traffic assignment problem. Restricted master problem is solved to e-optimality before bush reconstruction. We show the algorithm can solve a highly precision solution on a large-scale network with much less computational effort than a generic bush algorithm.
