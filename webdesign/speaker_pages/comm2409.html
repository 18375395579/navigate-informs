Title: Multi-objective Sustainable Facility Location<br>Author: Josue Velazquez-Martinez, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands, josue.velazquez@itesm.mx<br>Coauthor(s): Jaime Mora-Vargas, Edgar Blanco, Jan Fransoo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We formulate a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem to locate a distribution center in a dense urban environment. We characterize the SFL problem and present an efficient metaheuristic to approximate the Pareto frontier. We conduct an experimental study for a for a CPG company in Mexico City to demonstrate the applicability of our model.
