Title: Optimizing Quality of Service Levels in Probabilistic Network Capacity Design Problems<br>Author: Zhihao Chen, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, czhihao@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Siqian Shen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We formulate chance-constrained models to optimize probabilistic network design problems under uncertain demand with the aim of differentiating quality of service, which determines the priority of customers versus commodities. The problem determines the link capacities while ensuring a certain level of demand satisfaction through the flows. We reformulate the models as MIPs, compare results with models penalizing low satisfaction, and derive polynomial-time algorithms for special cases.
