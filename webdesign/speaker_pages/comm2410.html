Title: Setting Inventory Targets in a Multi-Product, Joint Service-Level Model with Correlated Demands<br>Author: Bahar Biller, Assistant Professor, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, billerb@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sridhar Tayur<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We introduce a simulation-based framework that develops mixed integer linear programs for multi-product settings in which joint service-level criteria naturally arise and solves them for inventory-target estimators using a simulation-optimization technique. A computational study illustrates the importance of using this framework for managing multi-product inventory subject to joint  service-level criteria under multivariate time-series demand uncertainty.
