Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, 30332, United States of America, sahmed@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Wang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a sample average approximation (SAA) method for stochastic programming problems involving an expected value constraint. Such problems arise, for example, in portfolio selection with constraints on conditional value-at-risk (CVaR).</br>
