Title: Generalization of Cliques, Independent Sets and Coloring<br>Author: Balabhaskar Balasundaram, PhD Candidate, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, baski@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sergiy Butenko, Illya Hicks<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk we will present a graph theoretic generalization of a clique, known as a k-plex, originally introduced in social network analysis. Based on this model, systematic generalizations for independent sets and coloring are also introduced. Computational complexity results, integer programming formulation and facets and valid inequalities for the associated polytope are presented. Branch-and-cut approaches are discussed and computational test results are provided.
