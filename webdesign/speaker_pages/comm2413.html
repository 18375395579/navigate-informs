We employ a two-stage stochastic program with endogenous uncertainty and solve it using a greedy algorithm with a performance guarantee. We found that assumptions 1 and 2 together significantly affected model performance, and yet assumption 3 did not have a significant effect. We also found a significant interaction between assumptions 1, 2, and 3.</br>
