Title: A Dynamic Programming-based Branch-and-Bound Heuristic for Traveling Salesman Problems<br>Author: Michael Poremba, Ph.D. Student, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Ave. GER240, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, poremba@usc.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a dynamic programming-based branch-and-bound heuristic for variants of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), including the time-dependent TSP and the prize-collecting TSP. We construct tours dynamically, using different bounds to guide our decisions. By building a search tree, we can backtrack to explore other potential solutions. We will discuss the computational challenges of implementing both an exact and a heuristic algorithm, along with results from computational experiments.
