Title: GNLP, an Open-Source Package for Rigorous Global Nonlinear Programming on Parallel Machines<br>Author: David M. Gay, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 0370, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-0370, United States, dmgay@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Pradeep Polisetty, Edward Gatzke, William Hart<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk gives an overview of GNLP, a branch-and-bound code for rigorous global optimization of algebraically specified nonlinear functions subject to nonlinear constraints involving bounded continuous or discrete variables.  GNLP builds on PICO's facilities for parallel computing, rewrites expression graphs to obtain convex or linear bounding functions, and uses some facilities from COCONUT (another open-source global-optimization project).  We give preliminary results from work in progress.
