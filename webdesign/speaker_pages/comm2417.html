Title: Generating Minimal Valid Inequalities<br>Author: Emre Yamangil, Research Assistant, Rutgers University Center for Operations Research, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, emreyamangil@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Endre Boros<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of generating a lattice-free convex set to construct a valid inequality that minimizes the sum of its coefficients for 2-row simplex cuts. We show that a pseudo-polytime generation of a best lattice-free convex set is possible. Applying these cuts lead to a non-negligible reduction in the size of the branch-and-cut tree.
