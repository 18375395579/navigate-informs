Title: Managing Pavement Maintenance and Rehabilitation Projects: A Stochastic Optimization Approach<br>Author: Wei Fan, Associate Professor, The University of Texas at Tyler, Department of Civil Engineering, 3900 University Blvd, Tyler, TX, 75799, United States of America, wfan@uttyler.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A good pavement management system (PMS) can enable decision makers to select the best maintenance/rehabilitation program, i.e., which maintenance treatment to use and where and when to apply it, so that a maximum utilization of available resources can be achieved. An stochastic optimization based integer linear programming model is formulated and solved. Case study is performed and comprehensive numerical results are also presented.
