Title: Redesigning Routes in Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Systems using Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)<br>Author: Jaime E. González, Instructor, Universidad de los Andes, Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Bogot? Colombia, je.gonzalez30@uniandes.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): Andrés L. Medaglia<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The BRT route redesign problem consists of modifying a set of operational routes to minimize the current congestion on the network, while satisfying the technical constraints of the BRT system. We propose a matheuristic that synergistically couples a mathematical program and a VNS. The VNS takes information from the output of the mathematical program to guide the search efficiently. We present computational results on realistic BRT topologies.
