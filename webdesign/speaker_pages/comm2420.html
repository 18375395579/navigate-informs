<br>Title: Bilevel Knapsack Problems: Complexity and Algorithms</br><br>Author: Margarida Carvalho, PhD student, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto, Rua do Campo Alegre 1021/1055, Porto, 4169-007, Portugal, m@margaridacarvalho.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrea Lodi, Gerhard Woeginger</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: There is a growing attention towards bilevel optimization due to its capability of modelling many real problems. However, this appealing side of the bilevel models comes with a cost: while integer single-level optimization problems are NP-complete, the second level of the polynomial hierarchy class is the natural hotbed for bilevel ones.   In this presentation, variants of the bilevel knapsack problem will be described along with complexity results and algorithmic approaches.</br>
