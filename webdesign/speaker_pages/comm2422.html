<br>Title: Convergence of Time-stepping Schemes for Passive and Extended Linear Complementarity Systems</br><br>Author: Lanshan Han, hanlsh@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alok Tiwari, Kanat Camlibel, Jong-Shi Pang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This talk provides an in-depth analysis of time-stepping methods for solving initial-value and boundary-value, non-Lipschitz linear complementarity systems (LCPs) under passivity and broader assumptions. The novelty of the methods and their analysis lie in the use of least-norm solutions in the discrete-time linear complementarity subproblems arising from the numerical scheme; these subproblems are not necessarily monotone and not guaranteed to have convex solution sets.</br>
