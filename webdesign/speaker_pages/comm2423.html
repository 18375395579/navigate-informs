Eng. & Eng. Manag., Shatin, NT, Hong Kong - PRC, dli@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiangyu Cui</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We derive the semi-analytical expressions of the global (pre-committed) efficient mean-variance policy for convex cone constrained markets and investigate analytically effects of portfolio constraints on time consistency in efficiency (TCIE), which further enables us to establish a general solution framework in constructing TCIE dynamic portfolio selection problem formulations by introducing suitable portfolio constraints.</br>
