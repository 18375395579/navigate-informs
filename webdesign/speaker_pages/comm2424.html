<br>Title: Smooth Optimization Approach for Sparse Covariance Selection</br><br>Author: Zhaosong Lu, Assistant Professor, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada, zhaosong@sfu.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Given a sample covariance matrix, we consider a maximum likehood problem penalized by 1-norm of entries  of the inverse covariance matrix to perform sparse covariance selection.  By exploiting the structure of this problem, we develop a smooth optimization approach  that has better theoretical complexity, and outperforms substantially the existing methods in practice.</br>
