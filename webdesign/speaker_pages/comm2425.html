Title: Robust Optimal Control with an Application to Inventory Management<br>Author: Changhyun Kwon, Assistant Professor, University at Buffalo, SUNY, Dept of Industrial & Systems Engineering, 438 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, chkwon@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Terry Friesz, Matthew Rigdon<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a method for handling uncertainty in optimal control problems via a robust optimization approach. We extend prior work on robust optimal control by treating an objective function that is nonlinear in states, controls, and uncertain parameters. An application to inventory management is provided.
