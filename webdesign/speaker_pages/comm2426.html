<br>Title: Pricing Problem Based Sampling in Metaheuristics for Mixed Integer Programs</br><br>Author: Chun Wang, University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Room 4126, Madison, 53705, United States, wang26@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Miller, Leyuan Shi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Nested Partitions (NP) is a metaheuristic strategy that focuses on promising feasible subregions while maintaining a global view of the whole solution space. An important feature of NP is the sampling scheme, which is used to generate good feasible solutions. We discuss ways to use information from the pricing problem from a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation to bias the sampling. This approach can help NP find better samples and thus improve computational convergence.</br>
