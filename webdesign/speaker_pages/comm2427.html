The single objective version of this problem is polynomially solvable. We address the multiobjective version and show that the algorithm designed for single objective OPP is not capable of finding all nondominated points. After analyzing the properties of nondominated points, we develop a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to find a nondominated point. We propose an approach to generate all nondominated points.</br>
