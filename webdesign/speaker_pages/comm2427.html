Title: Multiobjective Order Picking Problem<br>Author: Cansu Kandemir, PhD Student, Old Dominion University, Department of Engineering Management, Norfolk, VA, 23529, United States of America, ckand002@odu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozgur Ozpeynirci<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We work on the order picking problem (OPP) in a special warehouse with one picker. The single objective version of this problem is polynomially solvable. We address the multiobjective version and show that the algorithm designed for single objective OPP is not capable of finding all nondominated points. After analyzing the properties of nondominated points, we develop a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to find a nondominated point. We propose an approach to generate all nondominated points.
