<br>Title: Optimality-based Bound Contraction using Multiparametric Disaggregation</br><br>Author: Pedro Castro, LNEG, Estrada Paço Lumiar 22, Lisbon, Portugal, pedro.castro@lneg.pt</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ignacio E. Grossmann</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider non-convex mixed-integer bilinear programs (MINLP) and propose to use multiparametric disaggregation relaxations for optimality bound contraction. This allows us to further reduce the domain of the variables when compared to the traditional way of using McCormick envelopes. Taking the short-term scheduling problem of hydro power systems as a case study, we show that smaller optimality gaps can be achieved than those from commercial global solvers given the same computational time.</br>
