Title: Basis Reduction and Integer Programming Approaches to Number Partitioning<br>Author: Bala Krishnamoorthy, Washington State University, PO Box 643113 WSU, Pullman, WA, 99164-3113, United States of America, bkrishna@math.wsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Webb, Nathan Moyer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Number Partitioning Problem (NPP) is to divide n numbers in to two subsets, the difference of whose sums is minimized. We propose a mixed integer program (MIP) model for NPP, for which we consider basis reduction (BR) based reformulations. Second, we describe transformations of NPP to the shortest vector problem (SVP), which we tackle using BR algorithms. Third, we propose a heuristic called truncated NPP, where we solve an NPP instance with the last several digits of the numbers truncated.
