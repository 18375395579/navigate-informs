<br>Title: Solving Large Non-linear, Non-convex Discrete Pricing Problems using Randomized Search Algorithm</br><br>Author: Kresimir Mihic, Oracle Labs, 500 Oracle Parkway, 5IP2053, Redwood Shores, CA, 94065, United States of America, kresimir.mihic@oracle.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paraskevas Yiapanis, Andrew Vakhutinsky, David Vengerov</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Randomized Search (RS) is a solution technique that takes advantage of the finite nature of the decision variables to solve currently intractable or hard to solve problems.  Because of its intrinsically parallel nature, RS leverages multi-threaded microprocessors and scales almost linearly as thread count is increased. In our current testing, RS has provided a higher quality solution in less time than  the leading commercial solver.</br>
