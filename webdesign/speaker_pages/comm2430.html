<br>Title: Contingency-risk Aware Power System Design</br><br>Author: Ali Pinar, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, 94551, United States of America, apinar@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Neng Fan, Amy Cohn, Richard Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider optimally designing a power system so that it satisfies the N-k-e criterion, which requires at least 1-e_k fraction of the demand be met even after failures of any k system components. We present a mixed-integer formulation that covers transmission and generation expansion, and propose an algorithm that avoids combinatorial explosion in the number of contingencies. Our studies on modified instances of the IEEE-30 and IEEE-57-Bus systems showed the effectiveness of our methods.</br>
