Adding to this complexity, the objective function is ill-defined and multi-criteria. Instead of finding a unique optimal solution, our goal is to quickly find and present to the user a range of high-quality feasible solutions. We focus on the modeling of the problem and the algorithmic approach to generating multiple solutions.</br>
