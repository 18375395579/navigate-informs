Implementation issues will be discussed, computational experiments will be carried out to benchmark the effectiveness of this approach. We believe this work would provide a rich ground for testing Cross-Entropy related techniques, as well as for developing new techniques to improve the current Cross-Entropy heuristics.</br>
