Title: A General Cross-entropy Approach to Mixed Integer Programing<br>Author: Yingjie Lan, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland, 7323 Parkwood Ct Apt 204, Falls Church, 22042, United States of America, ylan@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball, Michael Fu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We introduce a general Cross-Entropy approach to mixed integer programming. Implementation issues will be discussed, computational experiments will be carried out to benchmark the effectiveness of this approach. We believe this work would provide a rich ground for testing Cross-Entropy related techniques, as well as for developing new techniques to improve the current Cross-Entropy heuristics.
