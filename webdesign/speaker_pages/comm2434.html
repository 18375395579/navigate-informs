Title: Probabilistic Constrained Stochastic Programming with Independent Discrete Random Variables<br>Author: Kunikazu Yoda, PhD candidate, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Rd, Piscataway, NJ, 08854-8003, United States of America, kyoda@rutcor.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andras Prekopa<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the probabilistic constrained stochastic programming problem where the random right-hand side vector of independent components follows a discrete distribution with a finite support. The decision variables can be integers or real numbers. The problem is formulated by a mixed-integer linear programming with the concept of p-efficient points of a distribution. We present some techniques to improve the performance of the solution with MILP solver software and show numerical examples.
