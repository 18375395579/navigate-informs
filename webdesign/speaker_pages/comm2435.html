Title: A Heuristic Approach for the Flow Refueling Location Model Allowing Driver Deviations<br>Author: Michael Kuby, Professor, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287-5302, United States of America, mikekuby@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jong-Geun Kim<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Deviation-Flow Refueling Location Model (DFRLM) locates p stations to maximize covered flows given a driving range of alt-fuel vehicles and ability to detour from shortest paths. Our greedy algorithms build an artificial feasible network in which arcs represent feasible paths between stations, origins, and destinations and then solve a shortest path algorithm on the feasible network. Experiments show the computational efficiency and effect on optimal locations and objective function values.
