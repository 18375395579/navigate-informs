The simultaneous design of the control systems and the infrastructure to support it will result in both enhanced controllability and provide a more efficient design process. We focus on the modular view of designing a system whose performance is determined by their ability to be controlled and on a method which produces robust systems which can evolve effectively. The focus is on the method, rather than the results.
