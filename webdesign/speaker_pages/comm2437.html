<br>Title: Kernelized Approximate Linear Programming</br><br>Author: Vivek Farias, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, vivekf@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ciamac Moallemi, Nikhil Bhat</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a practical, non-parametric ADP algorithm that enjoys graceful, dimension-independent approximation and sample complexity guarantees by ‘kernelizing?a recent mathematical program for ADP (the ‘smoothed?approximate LP). A computational study on a controlled queueing network shows that our procedure is competitive with state of the art parametric ADP approaches that employ carefully tailored approximation architectures.</br>
