MCO is typically employed in the Fluence-map optimization stage to find a Pareto-optimal solution that yields the desired trade-off between treatment evaluation criteria. In this study we investigate the extension of the MCO approach to the direct aperture optimization problem and develop heuristics to obtain a collection of apertures that can approximate the Pareto surface.
