Title: Biomass Logistics Network Design under Uncertainty and Price Considerations<br>Author: Gokhan Memisoglu, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Eng. Dept., 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, gmemis@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Halit Uster<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a two-stage stochastic program to model a farm-to-biorefinery biomass logistics network. In the first stage, the model determines capacities and locations for collection facilities as well the base biomass price that is offered to farmers. Second stage problem is to determine the transportation decisions and the amount of salvaged or emergency purchased biomass. An efficient solution approach and computational results are provided.
