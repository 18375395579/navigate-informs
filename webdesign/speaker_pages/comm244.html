Title: Shape Constrained Estimation of Value Functions in Dynamic Programing<br>Author: Mohammad Mousavi, Stanford University, 140 ayrshire farm lane#103, Stanford, CT, 94305, United States of America, mousavi@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a non-parametric method to estimate the value function in a Markov Decision process (MDP) by a convex estimator. The value function is well-known to be convex for a wide range of MDP problems. For this class of problems, we establish a non-parametric method to approximate the value function.
