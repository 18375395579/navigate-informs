The objective is to save the largest number of people considering that the likelihood of survival decreases by time. Because of the dynamic and uncertain nature of post-disaster conditions, the problem is formulated as a stochastic integer program and solved by specially designed algorithm. A case study is applied to illustrate this algorithm.
