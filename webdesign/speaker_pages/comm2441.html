The proposed approach uses particular heuristics to discover interesting subspace clusters more efficiently and selects a proper set of subspace clusters (i.e., groups of customers) as the solution to the campaign optimization problem. The experimental results show our approach is effective and efficient to discover the near-optimal solution.</br>
