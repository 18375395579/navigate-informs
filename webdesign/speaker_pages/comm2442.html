The aim is to use the smallest number of traction units, so as to cover a planned timetable of trips, by imposing a minimum number of places required for each trip and other technical constraints. We propose integer linear programming models and heuristics based on the associated linear programming relaxations. Computational results on real-world instances are presented.</br>
