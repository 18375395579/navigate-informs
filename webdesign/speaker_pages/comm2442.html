Title: Solving a Real-World Train Unit Assignment Problem<br>Author: Valentina Cacchiani, PhD Student, Universita di Bologna, Viale Risorgimento 2, 40136 Bologna, Italy, vcacchiani@deis.unibo.it<br>Coauthor(s): Alberto Caprara, Paolo Toth<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the problem of creating rosters for a set of traction units for a railway transportation company. The aim is to use the smallest number of traction units, so as to cover a planned timetable of trips, by imposing a minimum number of places required for each trip and other technical constraints. We propose integer linear programming models and heuristics based on the associated linear programming relaxations. Computational results on real-world instances are presented.
