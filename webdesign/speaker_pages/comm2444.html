However, none of them provide a rigorous game theoretic basis. Such a basis allows us to characterize theoretical results on equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and stability and provides new computational algorithms for computing equilibrium solutions efficiently. In this talk, we present complementarity formulations for the single and multiple user class single bottleneck models.</br>
