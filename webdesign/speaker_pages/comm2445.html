Title: A Combinatorial, Primal-dual Approach to Semidefinite Programs<br>Author: Satyen Kale, Princeton University, 35 Olden St, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, satyen@cs.princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sanjeev Arora<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Semidefinite programs (SDP) have been used in many recent approximation algorithms. We develop a  general primal-dual approach to solve SDPs using a generalization of the well-known multiplicative weights update rule to symmetric matrices. For a number of problems, such as Sparsest Cut and Balanced Separator in undirected and directed weighted graphs, and the Min UnCut problem, this yields combinatorial approximation algorithms that are significantly more efficient than interior point methods.
