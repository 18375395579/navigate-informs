Title: Identifying Styles in Product Design<br>Author: Tian Chan, PhD, INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Ave, Singapore, 138676, Singapore, tianheong.chan@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Manuel Sosa, Jurgen Mihm<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We introduce an approach to identify styles in product design. We built a theoretical foundation on what a style is and how designs are organized into styles. We then executed a graph-clustering algorithm to identify styles in design patents filed in the USA between 1976 and 2010. Our validation suggests that the algorithm performs no differently from humans. Finally, our analysis on the dynamics of styles suggests that the design world is becoming increasingly turbulent.
