<br>Title: Train Dispatching Model with Stochastic Capacity Breakdowns on an N-tracked Rail Network</br><br>Author: Lingyun Meng, School of Traffic and Transportation, 8507D, No.8 Teaching Building, No.3 ShangYuanCun, HaiDian District, China, lymeng@bjtu.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuesong Zhou</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents an integer programming formulation for the networked train dispatching problem. A Lagrangian relaxation solution approach is used to dualize complicating capacity constraints and decompose the original complex problem into a sequence of sub problems. The sub problems are solved by a shortest path algorithm. A priority rule-based algorithm is used to deduce dual solutions to feasible solutions. Numerical experiments are used to demonstrate the performance of this approach.</br>
