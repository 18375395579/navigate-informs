Title: A Generalized Benders' Algorithm for the Two-stage Stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Problem<br>Author: Anahita Hassanzadeh, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, anh509@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs, Menal Güzelsoy<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: One difficulty in generalizing the traditional Benders' scheme to general two-stage mixed integer linear stochastic problems arises in the challenge of finding effective functions to approximate the value function of the second stage problem from below. We focus on dual functions derived from branch-and-bound trees arising from solution of recourse subproblems. We elaborate on both the theoretical and computational implications of solving the two-stage problem with  such dual functions.
