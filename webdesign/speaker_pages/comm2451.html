Title: Robust Support Vector Machines via Integer Programming<br>Author: Paul Brooks, VCU, Dept. of Stat. Sci. and O.R., PO Box 843083, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States of America, JPBrooks@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Romy Shioda<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a popular mathematical programming-based method for classification.  This talk explores robust formulations of SVMs that are less sensitive to outliers than traditional formulations.  The robust formulations involve the use of discrete optimization.  Solution strategies and implemetations are described, and computational results are presented.
