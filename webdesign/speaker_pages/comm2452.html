Title: Idea Generation and the Quality of the Best Idea<br>Author: Karan Girotra, Professor, INSEAD, Boulevard De Constance, Fontainebleau, 77300, France, karan.girotra@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch, Karl Ulrich<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Creative problem solving often entails generation of multiple solutions to a problem followed by the selection of the top few. We examine the effectiveness of alternate solution generation and selection processes. Existing literature formalizes effectiveness as the average quality of solutions generated; we argue that the quality of the best solutions identified in the process is a more relevant metric. We then re-examine the prescriptions from existing literature using our alternate metric.
