We examine the effectiveness of alternate solution generation and selection processes. Existing literature formalizes effectiveness as the average quality of solutions generated; we argue that the quality of the best solutions identified in the process is a more relevant metric. We then re-examine the prescriptions from existing literature using our alternate metric.</br>
