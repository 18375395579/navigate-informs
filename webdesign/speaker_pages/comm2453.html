Title: A Modified Potential Reduction Method for Monotone Complementarity and Convex Programming Problems<br>Author: Kuo-Ling Huang, PhD Student, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, s9c2p1@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sanjay Mehrotra<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a homogeneous algorithm equipped with a modified potential function for the monotone complementarity problem. We show that this potential function is reduced by at least a constant amount if a scaled Lipschitz condition is satisfied. A practical algorithm based on this potential function is implemented in a software package named iOptimize. Computational results show that iOptimize takes fewer iterations than mature solvers Mosek and Ipopt.
