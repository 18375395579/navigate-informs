Title: Constrained Index Tracking Using Stochastic Receding Horizon Control (SRHC)<br>Author: Chang Hwan Sung, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Center, Room 479, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, chsung@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Primbs<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We use SRHC as a suboptimal approach to an infinite horizon constrained index tracking problem. The dynamics are lifted to handle constraints that involve state and control information at different points in time, and the finite horizon optimizations in RHC can be written as an SDP under the structure of innovations feedback. Computational results using the historical data show that SRHC is a promising approach in solving difficult portfolio optimization problems with constraints.
