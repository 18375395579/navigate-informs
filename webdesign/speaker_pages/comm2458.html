Title: An Exact Algorithm for Multistage Integer Multi-Commodity Flow Problems with Demand Uncertainty.<br>Author: Ioannis Gamvros, Staff Consultant, ILOG, Inc., 1080 Linda Vista Avenue, Mountain View, CA, 94043, United States, igamvros@ilog.com<br>Coauthor(s): S. Raghavan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Multi-stage stochastic programming problems in which decision variables are integer in all stages are exceptionally hard and are typically approached with approximation algorithms. We propose a reformulation scheme and an associated branch-and-price-and-cut approach that can solve exactly stochastic multistage integer multi-commodity flow problems. We present computational results on a problem motivated from the telecommunications industry.
