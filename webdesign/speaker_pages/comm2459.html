Title: Strong Cuts for Polynomial Inequalities via Disjunctive Arguments<br>Author: Mohit Tawarmalani, mtawarma@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Recently, it was shown that the convex hull of bilinear covering set with non-negative variables can be obtained as a disjunction of orthogonal sets. In this talk, we consider relaxations for bilinear inequalities with bounded variables. We explore the tightness of these relaxations. Then, we extend the techniques to polynomial covering sets, separable quasi-concave knapsacks, and special cases of polynomial inequalities with positive and negative terms.
