In this talk, we consider relaxations for bilinear inequalities with bounded variables. We explore the tightness of these relaxations. Then, we extend the techniques to polynomial covering sets, separable quasi-concave knapsacks, and special cases of polynomial inequalities with positive and negative terms.</br>
