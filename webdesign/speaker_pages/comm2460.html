<br>Title: Optimal Trade Execution with Dynamic Risk Measure and Primal-dual First-order Methods</br><br>Author: Qihang Lin, PhD Student, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, qihangl@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the optimal trade execution problem in an illiquid market by minimizing the coherent dynamic risk of the sequential transaction costs.  The prices of the assets are modeled as a discrete random walk perturbed by both temporal and permanent impacts related to the trading volume. We show that, when the dynamic risk measure is Markovian, the optimal strategy is time-consistent and static. Formulating the optimal execution problem as a saddle point problem, we proposed specialized primal and dual first-order methods to compute the the optimal strategy. The efficiency and scalability of our approaches are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</br>
