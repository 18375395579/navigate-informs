Title: A Two-stage Approach for Solving Multi-objective System Reliability Optimization Problems<br>Author: Haitao Liao, Assistant Professor, Wichita State University, 1845 Fairmount St., Industrial & Manufacturing Eng Dept, Wichita, KS, 67260-0035, United States, haitao.liao@wichita.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhaojun Li<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This research addresses multi-objective system reliability optimization problems. A two-stage approach is proposed to facilitate the optimization process. The first stage identifies implicit solutions followed by the second stage that selects only limited explicit solutions. A multi-objective heuristic method and a relative efficiency evaluation method are applied to reduce the size of Pareto optimal solutions for such system reliability optimization problems.
