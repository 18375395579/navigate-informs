<br>Title: A Comparison of MARS and SLAM in Approximate Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Danilo Macci? National Research Council / CNR-ISSIA, Via De Marini 6, Genova, GE, 16149, Italy, danilo.maccio@cnr.it</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diana Martinez, Victoria C Chen, Cristiano Cervellera</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The problem of numerically minimizing a functional cost typically involves the following two issues: (i) the choice of a class of models to approximate the solution; (ii) the definition of a sampling of the domain where the functional is evaluated. This work presents a comparison of performances given by two efficient techniques for function estimation, namely Multi-Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) and Semi-Local Approximate Minimization (SLAM) in different functional optimization contexts.</br>
