Title: Network Design Problem with Relay Stations Considering Survivability<br>Author: Sadan Kulturel-Konak, Associate Professor, Penn State Berks, Tulpehocken Rd., PO Box 7009, Reading, PA, 19610, United States of America, sadan@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abdullah Konak<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this research, the design problem copes with selecting network links and determining the relay stations?locations to minimize the design cost.  In addition to the distance constraint on the path that a signal can travel without visiting a relay station, the survivability of the paths is also considered.   A metaheuristics approach is designed to solve the problem, and its efficiency is shown on different problems.
