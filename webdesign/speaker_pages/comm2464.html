Title: On Optimal VWAP and Exponential Liquidation Strategies<br>Author: Youxun Shen, Quant Strategist, Lehman Brothers, 745 7th Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10019, United States, youxun.shen@lehman.com<br>Coauthor(s): Amit Manwani<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We focus on optimal liquidation for VWAP and exponential strategies.  Despite the nonconvex nature we were able to derive globally optimal solutions.  In the special yet important and popular case of a square root market impact function, we prove that at the optimal point, execution risk should equal transaction cost which coincides with commonly held trader intuition. Moreover, our numerical experiments indicate that the exponential efficient frontier dominates the VWAP efficient frontier.
