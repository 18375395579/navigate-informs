Despite the nonconvex nature we were able to derive globally optimal solutions.  In the special yet important and popular case of a square root market impact function, we prove that at the optimal point, execution risk should equal transaction cost which coincides with commonly held trader intuition. Moreover, our numerical experiments indicate that the exponential efficient frontier dominates the VWAP efficient frontier.</br>
