Title: Branch-and-Cut Approach Using IIS Cuts for Stochastic Integer Programs with Probabilistic Constraint<br>Author: Julian Gallego, Texas A&M University, Enemerging Technologies Building, Industrial & Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, TX 77843-3, United States of America, kamizama77@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Stochastic integer programs with probabilistic constraints (SIP-C) are difficult to solve because in general their feasible region is non-convex.  We present a new branch-and-cut method for SIP-C with random technology and right-hand side based on irreducible infeasible subsystems (IIS). We report computational results based on standard instances.
