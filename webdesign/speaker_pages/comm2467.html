Title: Disjunctive Cuts for Non-convex MINLP<br>Author: Pietro Belotti, Tepper S. of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, belotti@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francois Margot<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Lower bounds in Global Optimization are obtained by reformulation techniques, where a subset variables are associated with non-linear expressions. The associated non-convex equality constraints are commonly handled by branching on continuous variables. Disjunctive cuts can help improve the linear relaxation. We implement a separation routine for these cuts within an Open-Source branch&bound algorithm for Global Optimization. Preliminary results are presented on a set of MINLP instances.
