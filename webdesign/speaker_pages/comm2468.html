Zuluaga, Professor, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Ave., Bethlehem, United States of America, luis.zuluaga@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Javier Pena, Juan Vera</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A line of recent research looks at how non-convex optimization problems can be reformulated as a copositive optimization problem; that is, a conic program over the cone of copositive matrices. In this talk we discuss the conditions  under which a quadratically constrained quadratic program can be reformulated as a copositive optimization problem.</br>
