Title: Copositive Reformulation of Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs<br>Author: Luis F. Zuluaga, Professor, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Ave., Bethlehem, United States of America, luis.zuluaga@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Javier Pena, Juan Vera<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A line of recent research looks at how non-convex optimization problems can be reformulated as a copositive optimization problem; that is, a conic program over the cone of copositive matrices. In this talk we discuss the conditions  under which a quadratically constrained quadratic program can be reformulated as a copositive optimization problem.
