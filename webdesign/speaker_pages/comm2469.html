A concave node degree cost function is added to the objective function. Starting from a valid formulation, we propose a reformulation by discretization. Then we present a lagrangean relaxation and another reformulation with the same lower bound. Upper bounds are computed using a hybrid GRASP/VND heuristic. Computational results are shown on medium-sized instances.
