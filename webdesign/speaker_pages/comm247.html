Meaningful termination points are those minimizing a feasibility measure, but convergence to such points can be exceedingly slow.  In this talk we present a SQP penalty method that provides fast convergence guarantees for both feasible and infeasible problems by transitioning continuously between the goals of optimality and feasibility.</br>
