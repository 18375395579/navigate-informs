So we propose two mathematical models for evacuation plan for livestock via integer programming (IP) over networks. Due to NP-completeness of IP, we propose a heuristic algorithm for our problem. We end with simulation results/experiments with the map near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants.
