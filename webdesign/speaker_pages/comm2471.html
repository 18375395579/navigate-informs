Title: Directed Cuts for the 2-Root-connected Prize-collecting Steiner Network Problem<br>Author: Maria Kandyba, Dortmund University, Otto-Hahnstr. 14, Dortmund, 44227, Germany, maria.kandyba@cs.uni-dortmund.de<br>Coauthor(s): Markus Chimani, Petra Mutzel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the real-world problem of extending a given network in order to connect new customers. This can be formulated as a 2-root-connected prize-collecting Steiner network problem where certain customer nodes require two node-disjoint paths to the root. We present an ILP approach based on directed cuts, which is novel for problems requiring node-disjointness. We show that this formulation is theoretically and practically stronger than the traditional undirected cut approach.
