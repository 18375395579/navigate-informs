Title: Air Cargo Pickup and Delivery Problem with Alternative Access Airports<br>Author: Farshid Azadian, PhD Candidate, Wayne State University, 4815 Fourth St, Detroit, MI, 48201, United States of America, f_azadian@wayne.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ratna Babu Chinnam, Alper Murat<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study considers a freight forwarder's operational implementation of alternative access airport policy in a multi-airport region for air cargo transportation. This problem is formulated as a novel pickup and delivery problem, where the delivery cost is both destination and time dependent. An efficient solution method based on Lagrangian decomposition and variable target method with backtracking is developed.
