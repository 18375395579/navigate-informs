The technique is similar to reformulation-linearization technique, but uses different product factors. We also derive an equate-and-relax procedure that generates cuts in the space of the original problem variables. As a special case, we strengthen the well-known simple cut and use it to derive cuts that simultaneously exploit multiple complementarity constraints.</br>
