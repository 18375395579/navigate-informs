Title: Robust Optimization Applied to the Supply Chain of the Chilean Forest Industry<br>Author: Pamela Alvarez, Facultad de Ingeniería, Departamento de Ciencias de la Ingeniería, Universidad Andrés Bello, Chile, ppalvare@puc.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Jorge Vera<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The following work applies the methodology of robust optimization to problems of the supply chain of the Chilean forest industry in different planning levels. This methodology treats the uncertainty in optimization problems, associating with the uncertain problem a new one called robust counterpart. Specifically, robust models for problems of sawmill planning and problems of forest harvests are analyzed with uncertain yield parameters.
