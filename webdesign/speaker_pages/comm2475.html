Title: Electric Vehicles Routing: Shortest Path Problem with Recharging<br>Author: Nan Jiang, The University of Texas at Austin, 301 E Dean Keeton St., Stop C1761, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, jiang@utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Duthie, Travis Waller, Chi Xie<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A special constrained shortest path problem considering electric vehicles' en route recharging requirements is studied. An integer programming formulation is developed. Three solution algorithms are proposed and their computational performance is compared.
