Motivated by the naive choice of stepsizes in stochastic approximation (SA) methods, we provide almost-sure convergence theory for a distributed SA scheme with an adaptive steplength rule.  Additionally, to address problems where the mapping is not Lipschitz, we  present a distributed local randomization scheme that constructs a Lipschitzian approximation. Preliminary numerical results are seen to be promising.
