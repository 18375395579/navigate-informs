In this work we apply McCormick inequalities and disjunctive constraints to linearize the original nonlinear and non-convex optimization problem. Mixed Integer Programming models are derivate both in Polar as in Cartesian coordinates systems. Results compare both formulations with the original OPF model.</br>
