Title: The Optimal Power Flow Problem Model as a MILP (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming)<br>Author: Maria de Luján Latorre, Researcher, PSR, Praia de Botafogo 228/1701-A Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22250-145, Brazil, lujan@psr-inc.com<br>Coauthor(s): Sérgio Granville, Mario Veiga Pereira, Rafael Ferreira, Andr?Dias<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The OPF problem determines the optimal operation of generation and transmission system representing the AC network constraints in an integrated form. In this work we apply McCormick inequalities and disjunctive constraints to linearize the original nonlinear and non-convex optimization problem. Mixed Integer Programming models are derivate both in Polar as in Cartesian coordinates systems. Results compare both formulations with the original OPF model.
