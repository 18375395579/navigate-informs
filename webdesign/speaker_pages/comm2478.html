Horácio de Macedo 950, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, rrocha@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ignacio Grossmann, Marcus V. S. Poggi de Aragão</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a problem faced by PETROBRAS. This problem is to determine a minimum cost offloading scheduling of platforms to supply refineries. In this work we propose a decomposition algorithm that resembles the Benders decomposition algorithm but we present a new way of generating cuts based on disjunctive program.</br>
