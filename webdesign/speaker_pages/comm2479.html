In this talk, we formulate a stochastic integer programming (SIP) model to determine an optimal provider scheduling template, and then develop a procedure to search a heuristic optimal solution to the SIP model. Our sensitivity analysis results show that heuristic optimal scheduling templates are sensitive to the cost coefficients and the no-show rates.
