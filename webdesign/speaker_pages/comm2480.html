Schulz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a general framework for designing approximation schemes for combinatorial optimization problems, in which more than one objective functions are combined into one using l_p norms. The main idea behind this procedure is exploiting the approximate Pareto-optimal front for multi-objective optimization problems. Using this procedure, we obtain an FPTAS for some resource allocation and scheduling problems when the number of agents/machines is fixed, for any l_p norm,
