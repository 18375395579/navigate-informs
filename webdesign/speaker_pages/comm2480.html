<br>Title: A Framework for Designing Approximation Schemes for a Class of Combinatorial Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Shashi Mittal, M.I.T, E40-130, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, mshashi@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andreas S. Schulz</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a general framework for designing approximation schemes for combinatorial optimization problems, in which more than one objective functions are combined into one using l_p norms. The main idea behind this procedure is exploiting the approximate Pareto-optimal front for multi-objective optimization problems. Using this procedure, we obtain an FPTAS for some resource allocation and scheduling problems when the number of agents/machines is fixed, for any l_p norm,</br>
