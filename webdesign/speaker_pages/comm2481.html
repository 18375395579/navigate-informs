Title: Dynamic Congestion Pricing: Models and Computational Methods<br>Author: Terry Friesz, Marcus Professor, Penn State University, Department of Industrial & Mfg Engr., 305 Leonhard Bldg, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, tfriesz@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Changhyun Kwon, Matthew Rigdon, Tae Il Kim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We provide a brief review of dynamic congestion pricing models. In particular, we discuss the dynamic efficient toll problem and the dynamic optimal toll problem with dynamic user equilibrium constraints. Some algorithms and numerical examples are also presented.
