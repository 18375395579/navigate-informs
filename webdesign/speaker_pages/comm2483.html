Title: Circuit Tuning with IPOPT<br>Author: Andreas Waechter, Research Staff Member, IBM TJ Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, andreasw@watson.ibm.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: During the design of digital circuits, such as microprocessors, the optimal transistor widths have to determined, in order to achieve fast performance, given power and area constraints.  We will describe the implementation of the IBM-internal EinsTuner circuit tuning tool, which uses circuit simulations and the IPOPT nonlinear optimizer.
