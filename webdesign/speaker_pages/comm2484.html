<br>Title: Calculating Spare Hessian using Algorithmic Differentiation</br><br>Author: Brad Bell, Principal Mathematician, APL University of Washington, 1013 NE 40th Street, Seattle, WA, 98105-6698, United States of America, bradbell@seanet.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The CppAD package can use the fact that a Hessian is sparse  to reduce the work necessary to calculate the Hessian.  We will review how multiple columns of a sparse Hessian  can be computed with the same work as one column.  CppAD uses the greedy distance two graph coloring algorithm  to group columns that can be computed together.  We will review this algorithm and some speed  tests of the sparse Hessian calculation.  Finally we will suggest some ways in which this calculation  can be improved.</br>
