<br>Title: Large-scale Power Restoration</br><br>Author: Pascal Van Hentenryck, Professor, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, pvh@nicta.com.au</br><br>Coauthor(s): Carleton Coffrin, Ben Simon</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers the joint repair and restoration of the electrical power system after significant disruptions. This problem is computationally challenging because, when the goal is to minimize the size of the blackout, it combines a routing and a power restoration component. This paper proposes an hybrid optimization approach based on constraint programming providing high-quality results for infrastructures with more than 24000 components and 1200 damaged items.</br>
