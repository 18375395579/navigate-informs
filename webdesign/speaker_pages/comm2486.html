Title: A Mixed Integer Bilevel Programming Solver<br>Author: Scott DeNegre, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, sdenegre@Lehigh.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider novel solution approaches for mixed integer bilevel programs (MIBLPs). Extensions to polyhedral techniques developed for MIPs are derived and new classes of valid inequalities are introduced, leading to a branch-and-cut algorithm. New branching rules based on the value function of the lower-level problem are discussed. The Mixed Integer Bilevel Solver (MibS), an open-source solver for MIBLP that utilizes CHiPPs, will be described.
