Extensions to polyhedral techniques developed for MIPs are derived and new classes of valid inequalities are introduced, leading to a branch-and-cut algorithm. New branching rules based on the value function of the lower-level problem are discussed. The Mixed Integer Bilevel Solver (MibS), an open-source solver for MIBLP that utilizes CHiPPs, will be described.</br>
