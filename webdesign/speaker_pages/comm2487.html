Title: Robust Multi-Sensor Scheduling for Multi-Site Surveillance<br>Author: Timofey Turko, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, jk13@ufl.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper presents mathematical programming techniques for solving a class of multi-sensor scheduling problems. Robust optimization problems are formulated for both deterministic and stochastic cases using mathematical programming techniques. We conducted a case study for several types of networks.
