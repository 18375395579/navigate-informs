<br>Title: Robust Multi-Sensor Scheduling for Multi-Site Surveillance</br><br>Author: Timofey Turko, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, jk13@ufl.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents mathematical programming techniques for solving a class of multi-sensor scheduling problems. Robust optimization problems are formulated for both deterministic and stochastic cases using mathematical programming techniques. We conducted a case study for several types of networks.</br>
