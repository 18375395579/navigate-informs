Title: Approximate Dynamic Mechanism Design with Budget-Constrained Agents<br>Author: Santiago Balseiro, Assistant Professor, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States of America, srb2155@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Omar Besbes, Gabriel Weintraub<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In online advertising, ad slots are typically allocated using a second-price auction or a suitable modification of it. In this work, we explore, using a mechanism design approach, whether other auction formats could improve the auctioneer’s profit in the presence of budgets and other side constraints. In principle, this dynamic mechanism design problem is intractable. However, leveraging a Fluid Mean-Field Equilibrium approach we are able to obtain promising preliminary results for this problem.
