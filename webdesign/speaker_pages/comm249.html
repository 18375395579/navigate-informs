Title: Mechanism Design via Machine Learning<br>Author: Maria-Florina Balcan, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Computer Science, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3891, United States, ninamf@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Avrim Blum, Yishay Mansour, Jason Hartline<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We use techniques from sample-complexity in machine learning theory to reduce problems of incentive-compatible mechanism design to standard algorithmic questions, for a broad class of revenue-maximizing pricing problems. We apply our generic reductions to the problem of auctioning a digital good, to the attribute auction problem which (includes a wide variety of discriminatory pricing problems), and to the problem of item-pricing in unlimited-supply combinatorial auctions.
