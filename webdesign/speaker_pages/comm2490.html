Title: Bicriteria Scheduling with Machine Unavailability<br>Author: Hairong Zhao, Associate Professor, Purdue University Calumet, Hammond, IN, 46323, United States of America, hairong@purduecal.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yumei Huo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider bicriteria scheduling problems with limited machine availability constraints. We study both the parallel machine environment and the flow shop model. We give polynomial time algorithms and approximation algorithms for some problems; and for some harder problems, we develop heuristics and tested their performance by experiments.
