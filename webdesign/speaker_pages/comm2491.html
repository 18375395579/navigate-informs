Title: An Optimization Framework for Contingency-constrained Power Grid Operations<br>Author: Neng Fan, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, nfan@email.arizona.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we embed the contingency criteria (such as N-1, N-k, N-1-1 contingencies) defined by NERC into the power system's planning and operations problems. The whole problem can be formulated as a large-scale MIP with exponential number of contingency constraints. Several methods based on decomposition are proposed. We test our models and algorithms on several IEEE systems.
