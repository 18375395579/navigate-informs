Title: Robust Coverage Location Problems under Travel Time Uncertainty<br>Author: Iman Hajizadeh, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, iman@rotman.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman, Dmitry Krass<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the maximum covering problem on a network with travel time uncertainty. In addition to the standard stochastic and robust formulations, we optimize the average coverage subject to a bound on the worst case coverage. We present greedy and Lagrangian relaxation heuristics and compare their performances with MIP formulation.
