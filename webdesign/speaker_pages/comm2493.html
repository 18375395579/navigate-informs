Title: Performance Variability in Mixed Integer Programming<br>Author: Emilie Danna, Ilog Inc., 1195 W Fremont Ave, Sunnyvale, CA, 94087, United States of America, edanna@ilog.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The solving time for a given MIP model sometimes varies dramatically if  the branch-and-cut algorithm used to solve it is modified slightly, even  if the algorithmic change is theoretically neutral with respect to  performance. We will present evidence of this performance variability,  examine its causes, describe its consequences, propose a few ideas to  address it, and raise several related questions.
