<br>Title: Simple, Fast Heuristics Based on Preferable Intervals for the Single-Sink, Fixed-Charge Transportation</br><br>Author: Runchang Lin, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M International University, 5201 University Blvd, CH 313 M, Laredo, TX, 78041, United States, rlin@tamiu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Haibo Wang, Bahram Alidaee, Gary Kochenberger</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A new concept of preferable intervals is introduced and utilized in the context of single-sink fixed-charge transportation problems(SSFCTP). Properties of optimal solutions to the SSFCTP are investigated and necessary conditions for selecting suppliers are obtained in terms of preferable intervals. Several heuristics of polynomial time complexity are provided. Computational results are given showing that proposed method is both efficient and effective.</br>
