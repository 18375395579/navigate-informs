Title: Column Generation in Practice: Efficiency Gains Through Use of Concurrency and Lessons Learned<br>Author: Bertan Altuntas, Operations Research Software Developer, LeanLogistics Inc., 1351 S Waverly Rd, Holland, MI, 49423, United States of America, bertan.altuntas@leanlogistics.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Column generation is a well-known technique used to solve large scale linear programming problems. At LeanLogistics, we have implemented a column generation based vehicle routing problem solver within our On-Demand?Transportation Management System. In this talk, I would like to focus on some practical aspects of implementing a column generation based solver, how we utilized parallel processing to improve efficiency of the solver and most importantly the lessons learned along the way.
