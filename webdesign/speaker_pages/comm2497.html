Title: Simulation and Optimization<br>Author: Michael Fu, Professor, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, mfu@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chun-Hung Chen, Leyuan Shi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing a performance function from a simulation model.  We begin by classifying different types of problems, and then provide anoverview of the major approaches, followed by a more in-depth presentation of three specific areas: efficient simulation budget allocation, stochastic gradient estimation, and the nested partitions method.
