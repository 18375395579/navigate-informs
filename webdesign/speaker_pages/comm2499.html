Title: A Deterministic Rescaled Perceptron Algorithm<br>Author: Negar Soheili Azad, PhD Candidate, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, nsoheili@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Javier Pena<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The classical perceptron algorithm is a separation-based algorithm for solving conic-convex feasibility problems in a number of iterations that is bounded by the reciprocal of the square of the cone thickness. We propose a modified perceptron algorithm that leverages periodic rescaling for exponentially faster convergence, where the iteration bound is proportional to the logarithm of the reciprocal of the cone thickness and another factor that is polynomial in the problem dimension.
