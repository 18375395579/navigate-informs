<br>Title: Probabilistic Bisection Search for Stochastic Root-finding</br><br>Author: Rolf Waeber, Cornell University, 206 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, rw339@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Frazier, Shane Henderson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional stochastic root-finding algorithm that is motivated by the bisection algorithm. At each measurement point the algorithm collects enough information about the underlying function such that a posterior density, which reflects in some sense one's belief about the location of the root, can be updated. We discuss some convergence results and show how this algorithm, in addition to a point estimate, also provides a confidence interval of the root.</br>
