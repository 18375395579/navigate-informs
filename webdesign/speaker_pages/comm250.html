Title: Addressing Risk in a Supplier Selection Problem<br>Author: Lei Li, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, leili@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zelda Zabinsky<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: With implementation of JIT and trends to global outsouring, the risk presented in the strategic supplier selection decision process must be considered.  Risk is captured in a two-stage stochastic programming model with recourse and a chance constrained programming model to determine a Pareto set of suppliers and optimal order quantities with consideration of business volume discounts.
