Title: Advancing AND/OR Search for Optimization<br>Author: Rina Dechter, Professor, UC Irvine, Irvine, California, Irvine, CA, United States of America, dechter@ics.uci.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Radu Marinescu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recently, Branch-and-Bound search algorithms were developed, exploring the AND/OR search graph for solving  constraint optimization problems, demonstrating  tremendous gain using problem decomposition (using AND nodes), equivalence (by caching) and irrelevance  (via the mini-bucket heuristics). We show here  additional improvements  gained by exploiting constraint propagation, using initial upper bounds generated via stochastic local search and improving the quality of the guiding pseudo tree.
