Title: Optimal Learning With Non-Gaussian Rewards<br>Author: Zi Ding, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Maryland, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, zding@math.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ilya Ryzhov<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a theoretical and computational framework for approximating the optimal policy in multi-armed bandit problems where the reward distributions are non-Gaussian. Optimal stopping theory is used to characterize the value of the optimal policy, using a free-boundary partial integro-differential equation, for exponential and Poisson rewards. We solve the PIDE numerically and illustrate solution properties.
