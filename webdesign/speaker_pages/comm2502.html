Title: Solution of a Probabilistic Constrained Stochastic Programming Problem with Random Technology Matrix<br>Author: Andras Prekopa, Professor, RUTCOR, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, 08854, United States of America, prekopa@rutcor.rutgers.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We formulate and solve a probabilistic constrained problem, where some of the technology coefficients are normally distributed random variables. The method of solution combines the supporting hyperplane method and one, originally designed to solve problems with discrete random variables. Closed form formulas for the gradient and numerical results will be presented.
