<br>Title: A Tabu Search Heuristic for a Pricing Problem on a Network</br><br>Author: Luce Brotcorne, Associate Professor, LAMIH-ROI, University of Valenciennes, Le Mont Houy, Valenciennes Cedex 9, -, F 59313, France, luce.brotcorne@univ-valenciennes.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fabien Cirinei</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a bilevel pricing problem where a company (a leader) strives to maximize its revenue raised from tariffs imposed on a set of arcs while taking into account the cost minimizing behaviour of the customers. We propose a tabu search algorithm based on the characterization of feasible followers solutions as a set of paths. To assess the efficiency of the method, a comparison with previously proposed heuristics is made on instances solved   to optimality.</br>
