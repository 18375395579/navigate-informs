Title: Arbitrage Bounds on European Basket Options via Linear Programming<br>Author: Javier Pena, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, jfp@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Luis Zuluaga, Juan Vera<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We provide efficient linear programming formulations for computing  sharp upper and lower bounds on the price of an European basket option, given prices of similar options and absence of arbitrage. Our approach yields closed-form solutions for special cases of the problem. It also  enables the modeling of features such as options with negative weights and bid/ask spreads.
