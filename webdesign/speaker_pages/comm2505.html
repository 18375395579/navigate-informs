Title: Optimization of Sustainable Biofuel Supply Chain under Uncertainty<br>Author: Yongxi Huang, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, 314 Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, yxhuang@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fei Xie<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study presents a multi-objective stochastic programming approach for cellulosic biofuel supply chain design under uncertainty of conversion technology efficiency.  A compromise programming model is formulated to integrate economic competitiveness and environmental quality into system planning and operations. The findings of case study of California show that the technology efficiency can alter the system configurations, however through smart system modeling, the effects can be minimized.
