Title: Bounds and Heuristic for Optimal Bayesian Inventory Control with Unobserved Lost Sales<br>Author: Li Chen, Lead Scientist, TrueDemand Inc., 485 Alberto Way, Suite 200, Los Gatos, CA, 95032, United States, li@tdemand.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider a finite-horizon Bayesian inventory control problem with unknown demand distribution and unobserved lost sales.  It is generally difficult to obtain the optimal solution to this problem because of Bayesian updating with censored demand data. However, bounds for the optimal solutions along the sample path can be obtained. We show that these bounds can be easily computed and that they offer intuitive insights about the value of information and the value of learning.
