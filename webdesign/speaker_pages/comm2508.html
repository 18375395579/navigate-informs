Title: FilMINT: An Outer-approximation-based Solver for Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programs<br>Author: Kumar Abhishek, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, United States of America, kua3@Lehigh.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Sven Leyffer, Jeff Linderoth<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe a new solver, FilMINT, for MINLPs that implements a linearization-based algorithm in a branch-and-cut framework.   The MINTO framework allows us to easily employ cutting planes, primal heuristics, and other well-known MILP enhancements for MINLPs.   We offer new suggestions for generating and managing linearizations that are shown to be efficient on a wide range of MINLPs.   Comparisons to existing MINLP solvers are presented, that highlight the  effectiveness of FilMINT.
