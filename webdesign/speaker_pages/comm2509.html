Title: A Neurogenetic Approach for Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling<br>Author: Anurag Agarwal, Assistant Professor, Department of Decision and Information Sciences, University of Florida, College of Business Administration, Gainesville, FL, 32611-7169, United States, aagarwal@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Selcuk Colak, Selcuk Erenguc<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The Neurogenetic approach is a hybrid of genetic algorithms (GA) and the neural-network (NN) approach.  We propose this approach for solving the resource-constrained project scheduling problem.  GA search provides good diversification, while NN provides good intensification or local search to improve the solution quality.
