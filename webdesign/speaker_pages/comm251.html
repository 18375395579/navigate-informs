<br>Title: Submodular Valued Constraints</br><br>Author: Stanislav Zivny, PhD student, Oxford University Computing Laboratory, Wolfson Building, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QD, United Kingdom, Stanislav.Zivny@comlab.ox.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Instances of valued CSPs with submodular constraints can be minimised in polynomial time. We identify broad classes of submodular constraints over a Boolean domain which are expressible using binary submodular constraints, and hence can be minimised more efficiently, in cubic time. We also discuss the question of whether all submodular constraints of bounded arity over a Boolean domain are expressible using only binary submodular constraints, and can hence be minimised efficiently.</br>
