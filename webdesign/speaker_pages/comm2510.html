Title: Optimal Control for a Power Grid System<br>Author: Juan Li, Columbia University, IEOR Department, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, jl3035@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jose Blanchet, Daniel Bienstock<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Considering a power grid system with random wind power and stochastic line outages, we study the optimal control in the rare event of a cascading failure by solving a chance constrained optimization problem. We assume the amount of power generated by wind farms follows   different distributions. Large deviations behavior is also discussed.
