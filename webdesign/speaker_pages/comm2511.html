In general the developed models are large scale mixed integer models. The application of decomposition methods seems to be a good approach for the resolution of this type of problems. The question is which decomposition method gives the faster convergence in each case. We present a comparison of classical decomposition methods and some extension of them applied in two case studies of scheduling in refineries.</br>
