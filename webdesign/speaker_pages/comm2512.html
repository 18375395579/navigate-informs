Title: Stochastic Integer Programming Applications in Dynamic Hybrid Systems<br>Author: Suvrajeet Sen, Professor, The Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, sen.22@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Binyuan Chen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Dynamic hybrid systems lead to mixed-integer programming problems, and in cases where the system parameters are uncertain, these systems lead to stochastic mixed integer programs.  Such models arise in a variety of applications such as the unit commitment model in power systems.  The introduction of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar lead to such models. We will discuss a general SMIP framework for dynamic hybrid systems, and apply it to the above application.
