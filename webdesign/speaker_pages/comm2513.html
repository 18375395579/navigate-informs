Jones has proven surprisingly practical, especially when coupled with a local pattern search algorithm such as MADS by Audet and Dennis. Massively parallel implementations of these algorithms, necessary for realistic problems, are highly nontrivial. This talk will summarize the parallel DIRECT and MADS algorithms, place them in the context of global optimization, and describe recent applications in MDO and systems biology.</br>
