A variety of solution techniques (i.e., Lagrangian relaxation, Greedy, Interchange) is developed and analyzed. We also propose an alternative formulation including a continuum approximation model for this problem. Numerical study is conducted to test the performance of the proposed algorithms and draw managerial insights.</br>
