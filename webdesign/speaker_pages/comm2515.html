Title: Optimal Location of Wind Power Capacity: A Point-estimate Solution Approach<br>Author: Salvador Pineda, Technical University of Denmark, DTU Electrical Engineering, Elektrovej, Kongens Lyngby, 2800, Denmark, spmo@elektro.dtu.dk<br>Coauthor(s): Juan Miguel Morales<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a tool for a generating company to optimally decide on the investment in new wind power capacity. The tool is formulated as a stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which is hard to solve. We propose a point-estimate solution approach that effectively captures the information embedded in the probability distributions of the uncertain parameters, while remarkably trimming down the computational burden of the model.
