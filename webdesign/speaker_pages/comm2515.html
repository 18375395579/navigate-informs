The tool is formulated as a stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which is hard to solve. We propose a point-estimate solution approach that effectively captures the information embedded in the probability distributions of the uncertain parameters, while remarkably trimming down the computational burden of the model.</br>
