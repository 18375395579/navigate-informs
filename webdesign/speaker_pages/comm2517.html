Title: Statistical Stopping Criteria for a Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm<br>Author: Natalia Viktorovna, Analytics Consultant, SAS Institute, 100 Sas Campus Drive, T6059, Cary, NC, 27513, United States of America, natalia.viktorovna@sas.com<br>Coauthor(s): Reha Uzsoy, Juan Gaytan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this research we explore the data structure at iterations of a genetic algorithm. Main objective is the generation of a statistical stopping criterion. We fit a multivariate distribution to objective function values and estimate the probability of creating new non-dominated solutions. This probability is used as a stopping criterion in a modified NSGA II aimed at solving the Multicriteria Project Scheduling Problem. Computational experimentation was developed to test the criteria performance.
