Title: PICO's new hierarchical branch-and-bound system for massively parallel IP<br>Author: Cynthia Phillips, Senior Scientist, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 1326, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1326, United States of America, caphill@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Eckstein, Ojas Parekh, John D. Siirola, Jean-Paul Watson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present the design, implementation, and large-scale parallel computational results for a new capability in the PICO (Parallel Integer and Combinatorial Optimizer) massively-parallel mixed-integer programming (IP) solver.  We leverage the PICO ramp up system for automatic IP decomposition and carefully manage runtime conditions to effectively run arbitrary black-box IP solvers on massively parallel systems.  Our computational results use a Sandia National Laboratories' 20,000-core system.
