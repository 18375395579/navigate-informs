Title: Symmetry in the Unit Commitment Problem<br>Author: James Ostrowski, University of Tennessee, 1425 S Stadium Dr, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States of America, jostrows@utk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jianhui Wang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Adding symmetry-breaking to a highly symmetric instance of a MILP problem can  reduce the size of the problem's feasible region. The same can be  said for good dominance constraints. In this talk we will examine the impact of  using dominance arguments to strengthen symmetry breaking constraints for the  Unit Commitment (UC) problem. Symmetry is present in the UC problem when there are several generators of the same type.
