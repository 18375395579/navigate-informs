Title: A Condor Application: Solving Constrained Facility Layout Problems with Genetic Algorithm<br>Author: Esengul Tayfur, Clemson University, Department of Industrial Engineering, 110 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States, etayfur@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mary Beth Kurz<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many researchers have focused on the solution approaches used for locating departments with unequal areas into a facility. Some of them have suggested a genetic representation with the use of adaptive penalty functions. We proposed an alternate genetic algorithm representation by using same penalty functions.  During the experimentation process of this research, the Condor software is utilized in order to solve many different genetic settings in a considerably shorter period of time.
