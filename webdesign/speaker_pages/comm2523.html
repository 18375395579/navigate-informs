<br>Title: A Dual Ascent Procedure for the Design of Virtual Private Networks</br><br>Author: Ishwar Murthy, Professor, Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, 103 NF, IIM Bangalore, Bannerghatta Rd, Bangalore, 560076, India, ishwar@iimb.ernet.in</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sri Narasimhan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we present a new formulation and solution procedure for designing virtual private networks for corporate networks.  We study the following problem: Given the locations of the corporate offices we would like to design a virtual private network that best connects the various corporate locations.  We formulate an integer programming problem and develop a dual ascent procedure for solving large-scale problems approximately. Computational results are provided.</br>
