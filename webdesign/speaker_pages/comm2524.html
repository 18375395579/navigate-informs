Title: Strong valid inequalities for the point packing problem<br>Author: Aida Khajavirad, IBM TJ Waston research center, New york, United States of America, aidakhajavi@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of packing equal circles in a square. We pose this problem as a global optimization problem and study some important properties of the convex hull of the feasible set. We present new classes of cutting planes to approximate the polyhedral convex hull and compare their strength with existing relaxations.
