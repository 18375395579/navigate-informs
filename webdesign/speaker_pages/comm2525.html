<br>Title: An Adaptive Tabu Search Heuristic for the LPDPTW with a Theater Distribution Application</br><br>Author: Robert Burks, Doctoral Candidate, United States Air Force, 145 Freesia Drive, Dayton, OH, 45431, United States, Robert.Burks@afit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Moore</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This research seeks to blend the PDPTW and LRP areas of research to formulate a location scheduling pickup and delivery problem with time windows to model theater distribution.  The research utilizes advanced tabu search techniques, including adaptive tabu search and group theory applications, to develop a heuristic procedure for solving the LPDPTW.  Group theory provides the structural foundation that supports adaptive tabu search's efficient search and movement through the solution space.</br>
