The algorithm is based on modern smoothing techniques for non-smooth convex optimization and requires O(1/eps) iterations to compute an eps-equilibrium. Fast iterations enable the approximation of equilibria for games with a tree representation of 100 billion nodes. We develop heuristic improvements and demonstrate their efficacy on a range of real-world games.</br>
