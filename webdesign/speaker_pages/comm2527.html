<br>Title: Compiling Constraint Networks into and/or Multi-valued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs)</br><br>Author: Rina Dechter, University of California, Irvine, dechter@ics.uci.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Mateescu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We augment Ordered Decision Diagrams with AND nodes, to capture function decomposition structure yielding AND/OR multivalued decision diagram (AOMDD). AOMDDs compile a constraint network into a canonical form supporting polynomial time solution counting, enumeration and equivalence queries. The AOMDD size, generation time and space are exponentially bounded by the model’s treewidth. AOMDDs can also be extended to compile optimal solutions in a combinatorial optimization problem.</br>
