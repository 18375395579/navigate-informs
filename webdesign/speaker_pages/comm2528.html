Title: Accelerated Gradient Methods for Nonconvex Nonlinear and Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Saeed Ghadimi, Ph.D. Candidate, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, sghadimi@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guanghui Lan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present an accelerated gradient (AC-GD) method and establish its complexity results for solving a class of nonlinear nonconvex optimization problems.  We show that, if the objective function contains both smooth convex and noconvex terms, choosing larger stepsizes for the AC-GD method allows us to have a unified analysis for both convex and nonconvex terms. We also generalize this method for solving the above class of problems under stochastic programming (SP) setting.
