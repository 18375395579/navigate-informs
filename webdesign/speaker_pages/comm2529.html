Title: A Bilevel Model for Preventive Healthcare Facility Network Design with Congestion<br>Author: Yue Zhang, PhD Candidate, McGill Unviersity, 1001 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC, H3A 1G5, Canada, yue.zhang3@mail.mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Vedat Verter, Patrice Marcotte, Oded Berman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper provides a methodology for designing a network of preventive healthcare facilities so as to maximize participation. To determine the number of open facilities and the location of each facility, we formulate the problem as a bilevel optimization model. A heuristic solution procedure is provided. A real life application (breast cancer screening centers in Montreal) is examined at last, and the impacts of capacity pooling are discussed.
