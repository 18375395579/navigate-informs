Title: Rapid Re-Planning of a Launch Schedule.<br>Author: Thomas Turner, Scientist, NSWCDD, Code B32, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA, 22448, United States, Thomas.G.Turner@navy.mil<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The planned firing schedule of cruise missiles from a platform is often perturbed at the last minute to accommodate over-water routing constraints and coordinated fires desires.  The issues involved in rapidly re-planning the firing schedule are examined and an integer programming formulation to solve the problem is proposed.
