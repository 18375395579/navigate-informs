We propose a new approach that utilizes the p-median problem. First, a linear programming model is solved to collect various dosimetry based statistics. Partial Least Squares is applied to eliminate insignificant attributes as a pre-processing technique. The p-median problem finds n-clusters and selects n representative angles from each cluster. Some examples demonstrate potential of this method for the beam selection problem.
