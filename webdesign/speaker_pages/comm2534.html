Title: Random Number Generators and Open Source<br>Author: Jiheng Zhang, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 ferst dr, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, jrz@gatech.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Numerical experiments on stochastic systems normally involves random number generators. The quality of random numbers generated is very important in obtaining accurate insight from numerical results. We discuss some existing random number generators, and present a user friendly and open source package written by the the speaker.
