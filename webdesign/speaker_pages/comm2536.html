Interbank liabilities evolve stochastically over time, and default events have a persistent impact on the the network. The optimal bailout policy and clearing payments are recovered as solution of a stochastic dynamic programming problem.  Our analysis provides a tool to support regulator decisions of when and where to intervene to prevent financial stability.</br>
