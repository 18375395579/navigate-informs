By using a multi-objective optimization approach, we aim to balance the efficiency of the system and geographic equity throughout the nation. We use two integer programming models, one of which aims to maximize the efficiency of the allocation mechanism, while the other tries to maximize the equity measure across all OPOs.</br>
