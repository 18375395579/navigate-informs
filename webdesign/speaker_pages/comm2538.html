Title: Optimal Design of Regions for Liver Transplantation: Balancing Allocation Effciency and Equity<br>Author: Mehmet C Demirci, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, demirci@ie.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edwin Romeijn, Andrew Schaefer<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Currently the in the U.S., a harvested liver is offered hierarchically to patients, first within the local OPO, then regionally and finally nationwide. By using a multi-objective optimization approach, we aim to balance the efficiency of the system and geographic equity throughout the nation. We use two integer programming models, one of which aims to maximize the efficiency of the allocation mechanism, while the other tries to maximize the equity measure across all OPOs.
