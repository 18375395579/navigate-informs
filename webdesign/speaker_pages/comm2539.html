In the context of search, certain industry applications have used datasets in 2^64 (square of billion) dimensions. We introduce a probabilistic method called b-bit minwise hashing, which can be seamlessly integrated with statistical learning algorithms such as logistic regression or SVM to solve extremely large-scale prediction problems.  Experimental results on 200GB data (in billion dimensions) will be presented.</br>
