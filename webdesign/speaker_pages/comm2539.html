Title: Probabilistic Hashing Methods for Fitting Massive Logistic Regressions and SVM with Billions of Variables<br>Author: Ping Li, Assistant Professor, Department of Statistical Science, Cornell University, 1192 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853-3801, United States of America, pingli@cornell.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Modern statistics tasks often encounter extremely high-dimensional massive data. In the context of search, certain industry applications have used datasets in 2^64 (square of billion) dimensions. We introduce a probabilistic method called b-bit minwise hashing, which can be seamlessly integrated with statistical learning algorithms such as logistic regression or SVM to solve extremely large-scale prediction problems.  Experimental results on 200GB data (in billion dimensions) will be presented.
