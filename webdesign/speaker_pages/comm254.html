Title: Optimization of Noisy Functions<br>Author: Michael Ferris, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin, 1210 West Dayton Street, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, ferris@cs.wisc.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the use of Bayesian methods combined with existing (derivative-free) optimization procedures to effect the optimization of simulation codes.  Key ideas relate to Monte Carlo validation of optimization steps, coupled with nonparametric tests to determine promising regions.  The methods are tested on a number of important applications.
