Unlike the existing methods that incrementally build the solution path through a  combination of local linear piecewise approximation and re-calibration, we propose an efficient global approximation to the whole solution path. The proposed methodology avoids high dimensional numerical optimization and is therefore faster and more stable in computation.</br>
