Title: Constraint Integer Programming<br>Author: Tobias Achterberg, Ilog, Germany, tachterberg@ilog.de<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We introduce the concept of constraint integer programming and our solver framework SCIP. Our applications, namely mixed integer programming and chip design verification, provide examples of how SCIP can be used to solve practical problems.
