Title: Capacity-dependent Bid-prices for Network Revenue Management<br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, School of ORIE, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, ht88@cornell.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a method to approximately solve the dynamic programming formulation of the network revenue management problem. Our approach is based on relaxing the constraints that link the decisions for different flight legs. The resulting policy can be interpreted as a capacity-dependent bid-price policy.
