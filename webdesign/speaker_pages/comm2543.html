We solve one of the sub-problems, which looks for the 3-dimensional coordinates of atoms that satisfy all the given equality and inequality distance constraints. This problem can be formulated as quadratically constrained quadratic programming problems. We solve this problem via semidefinite programming relaxations and some local search methods.</br>
