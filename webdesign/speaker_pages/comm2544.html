Title: Portfolio Selection with Robust Estimation<br>Author: Francisco J. Nogales, Assistant Professor, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain, FcoJavier.Nogales@uc3m.es<br>Coauthor(s): Victor DeMiguel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: It is well-known that traditional portfolios have unstable weights that fluctuate substantially over time. We propose a class of portfolios with better stability properties. These portfolios are constructed using certain robust estimators and can be computed by solving a single nonlinear program, where robust estimation and portfolio optimization are performed in a single step. The new portfolios are more stable and have better out-of-sample performance than the traditional ones.
