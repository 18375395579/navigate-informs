Title: Stochastic Integer Programming Models for Air Traffic Flow Management<br>Author: Saravanan Venkatachalam, PhD Candidate, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering Dept, College Station, TX, United States of America, saravanan@entc.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guglielmo Lulli, Luca Corolli, Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a two-stage stochastic integer programming formulation for the air traffic flow management (ATFM) problem under capacity uncertainty due to variable weather conditions. The model deals with the strategic problem of resolving imbalances between air traffic system demand and capacities through the definition of flight control actions. We consider a decomposition approach that takes advantage of the underlying structure of the problem to solve realistic instances of the problem.
