Title: Risk Averse Toll Pricing<br>Author: Xuegan (Jeff) Ban, Assistant Research Engineer, CCIT, University of California, Berkeley, 2105 Bancroft Way, Berkeley, CA, United States, xban@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shu Lu, Michael Ferris, Henry Liu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We formulate the second-best toll pricing as a bi-level problem. We show that if the lower level user equilibrium has multiple solutions, many existing toll design schemes are “risk-prone:?the optimal toll is sought in such a way that one “wishes?the ideal scenario will always happen. We further propose a “risk-averse?approach in which the toll is optimal for the worst-case scenario. Some examples are given to illustrate these two toll pricing approaches.
