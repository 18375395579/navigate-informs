Building upon existing clustering algorithms and using sampling and partition-based approaches, we demonstrate that accurate clusters can be determined. The proposed techniques should prove useful for analyzing extremely large data warehouses and large amounts of streaming data, where clustering the entire data set is not possible due to computational limitations.</br>
