Title: Clustering Large Data Sets: New Techniques and Insights<br>Author: Jesse Bockstedt, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, jesse.bockstedt@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Gediminas Adomavicius, Vishnu Parimi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present new data mining approaches for deriving clustering solutions from data sets that are too large for traditional techniques. Building upon existing clustering algorithms and using sampling and partition-based approaches, we demonstrate that accurate clusters can be determined. The proposed techniques should prove useful for analyzing extremely large data warehouses and large amounts of streaming data, where clustering the entire data set is not possible due to computational limitations.
