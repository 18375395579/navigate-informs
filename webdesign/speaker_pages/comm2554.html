<br>Title: Improving Optimum Estimates in Large-scale Stochastic Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: John Birge, Professor, Chicago Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago, Chicago, 60637, United States of America, john.birge@chicagogsb.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Large-scale optimization models involve estimates of many parameters that inherently lead to erroneous solutions. This talk presents new development on improving optimum estimates in large-scale stochastic optimization problems using optimal solutions of multiple batches.</br>
