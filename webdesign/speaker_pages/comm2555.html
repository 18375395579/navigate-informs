Title: Optimal Deleveraging with Market Impact<br>Author: Jingnan Chen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, jchen98@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jiming Peng, Liming Feng, Yinyu Ye<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider an optimal liquidation problem where the objective is to meet specified leverage ratio at the minimal cost. Under linear price impact, the problem reduces to a generally non-convex quadratic program with quadratic and box constraints. We derive some analytical results regarding the optimal liquidation strategy. A Lagrangian method is proposed to solve the problem numerically.
