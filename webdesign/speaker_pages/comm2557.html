Title: Iterative Methods for Generalized Saddle-point Problems<br>Author: Philip Gill, Professor, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, # 0112, La Jolla, CA, United States, pgill@ucsd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joshua Griffin, Anders Forsgren<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider iterative methods for generalized saddle-point problems that arise in interior methods for general nonlinear optimization. We focus on the application of the preconditioned conjugate-gradient method to a certain ``doubly-augmented system'' that is positive definite with respect to both the primal and the dual variables.
