Title: Efficient Robust Formulations for Portfolio Optimization<br>Author: Roy Kwon, Professor, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, rkwon@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Domnyck Prasad<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider efficient robust formulations for the classical mean-variance portfolio problem by considering an alternative formulation for which we demonstrate is sensitive to perturbations in the input. We develop a robust version for this alternative formulation and illustrate the advantages over robust quadratic formulations.
