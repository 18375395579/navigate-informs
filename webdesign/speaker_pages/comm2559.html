The multi-point approach has recently been incorporated in a constructive search algorithm, yielding near state-of-the-art performance. We examine a hybridization of these two approaches. Our hybrid algorithm enables fine control of the relative effort expended in intensification and diversification phases, allowing us to quantify their relative contribution to aggregate algorithm performance.</br>
