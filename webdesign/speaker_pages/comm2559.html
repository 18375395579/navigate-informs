Title: A Multi-point Constructive Search / Metaheuristic Hybrid for Job Shop Scheduling<br>Author: Chris Beck, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Rd, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, jcb@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Paul Watson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Sophisticated multi-point metaheuristics represent the state-of-the-art in job shop scheduling. The multi-point approach has recently been incorporated in a constructive search algorithm, yielding near state-of-the-art performance. We examine a hybridization of these two approaches. Our hybrid algorithm enables fine control of the relative effort expended in intensification and diversification phases, allowing us to quantify their relative contribution to aggregate algorithm performance.
