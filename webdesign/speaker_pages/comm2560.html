Title: Global Optimization for a Piecewise Linear Regression Spline Function<br>Author: Nadia Martinez, The University of Texas at Arlington, 415 Summit Ave. Apt. No. 213, Arlington, TX, 76013, United States of America, nadia.martinezcepeda@mavs.uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger, Victoria Chen, Diana Martinez<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this research, we optimize a piecewise linear version of a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) function subject to constraints that include both linear regression models and piecewise linear MARS models. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is developed and solved using branch-and-bound. The MIP is adjusted to enable flexibility to handle both continuous and categorical variables. This method is demonstrated on designing an automotive safety system for a major US automaker.
