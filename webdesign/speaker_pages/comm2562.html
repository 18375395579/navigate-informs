<br>Title: Transmission Expansion with Demand and Contingency Uncertainty and Transmission Switching</br><br>Author: Kathryn Schumacher, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, Industrial & Operations Eng. Dept., Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, kaschu@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Chen, Amy Cohn</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the robust transmission expansion problem where feasible operation is desired for all reasonable demand/renewable generation values and for all plausible contingency events. Furthermore, we consider the situation where transmission switching is an allowable recovery action. We present a model of this problem, and an algorithm to solve this model. Computational results will be discussed.</br>
