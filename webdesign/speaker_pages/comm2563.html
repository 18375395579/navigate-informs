Title: Developments in SAS MILP Solver<br>Author: Amar Narisetty, Operations Research Specialist III, SAS Institute, 100 SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC, 27513, United States of America, Amar.Narisetty@sas.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The SAS MILP solver implements a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving mixed integer linear programs. In this talk, we give an overview of the recent improvements that are incorporated in the SAS MILP solver. These improvements are in presolve, LP, cuts, heuristics and a new option for decomposable MIPs. We present computational results to demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements.
