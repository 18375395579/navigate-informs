<br>Title: New SDP Relaxations for QAPs Based on Matrix Splitting</br><br>Author: Jiming Peng, Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Dept. of Industrial & Enterprise Systems, 104 S.

Solving QAP instances of size n=30 has been recognized as a computational challeng. Moreover, even finding a strong lower bound for QAPs of size n>=30 is nontrivial. In this talk, we introduce several new SDP relaxations for QAPs based on matrix splitting and show that strong bounds can obtained effectively for large scale QAP instances upto n=200.</br>
