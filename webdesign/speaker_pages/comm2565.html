While this condition is sufficient to guarantee that the solution will be found scanning each node exactly once, it is not necessary. In this paper, we propose less restrictive conditions that allow the scanning of a node that does not have the minimum label, yet still maintaining sufficiency in scanning each node exactly once.  Several implementation ideas of the new conditions are discussed. One label setting and one flexible hybrid approach that combines label setting and label correcting properties are implemented. The computational complexity of the hybrid algorithm is shown to be better than that of label correcting algorithms. Moreover, four additional shortest path algorithms--among the fastest reported in the literature--are coded and tested, so that objective comparisons can be made.</br>
