Title: Computation of the Second-order Covariance Matrix of Markov Traffic Assignment Models<br>Author: Fan Yang, Assistant Professor, City University of New York, 140th St and Convent Ave, New York, NY, 10031, United States, fyang@ccny.cuny.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Several iterative or approximated methods were proposed to estimate the stationary covariance matrix of day-to-day Markov traffic assignment models. In this talk, we conclude that we can efficiently compute the analytical solution of the covariance matrix and its inverse under mild condition, i.e., the link travel time function is symmetric.
