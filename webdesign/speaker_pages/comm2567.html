Title: First-Order Primal-Dual Algorithms for Cone Programming<br>Author: Renato Monteiro, Professor, ISyE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States, monteiro@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guanghui Lan, Zhaosong Lu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk, we discuss first-order algorithms for solving cone programming problems. The algorithm consists of applying well-known first-order methods by Nesterov and Nemirovski to suitable reformulations of the cone programming problem. We compare the different variants obtained in this manner among themselves and compare the performance of the most efficient variant against the low-rank method of Burer and et al.'s on a set of randomly generated semidefinite programming problems.
