The algorithm consists of applying well-known first-order methods by Nesterov and Nemirovski to suitable reformulations of the cone programming problem. We compare the different variants obtained in this manner among themselves and compare the performance of the most efficient variant against the low-rank method of Burer and et al.'s on a set of randomly generated semidefinite programming problems.</br>
