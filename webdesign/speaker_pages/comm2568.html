<br>Title: The Continuous K-medians Problem in a Convex Polygon</br><br>Author: Raghuveer Devulapalli, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St SE, Office L100, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, devul002@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Carlsson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Given an convex polygon C and an integer k, we present a  fast and simple factor 2.02 approximation algorithm for the continuous  k-medians problem. The objective here is to chose k landmark points  so as to minimize the average distance between these landmark points  and set of clients who are located uniformly within the convex polygon.  The key to our algorithm is a geometric relationship between any convex  polygon and its minimum bounding box.</br>
