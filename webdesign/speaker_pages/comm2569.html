Hammer, Endre Boros</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Numerous algorithmic graph theory problems (MAX-CLIQUE, MIN-COV, MAX-CUT, BALANCING) are formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, allowing the exact solution within seconds of real life problems (coming from telecommunications, VLSI design, biological/social networks) with 500,000 (and more) vertices. Applications to clustering problems with millions of objects are presented.</br>
