<br>Title: On a Generalization of the Master Cyclic Group Polyhedron</br><br>Author: Ricardo Fukasawa, GeorgiaTech, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, rfukasaw@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sanjeeb Dash, Oktay Gunluk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the Master Equality Polyhedron (MEP) which generalizes the Master Cyclic Group Polyhedron (MCGP) and the Master Knapsack Polyhedron (MKP) and present a characterization of its nontrivial facet-defining inequalities.    In addition, we analyze how to lift facet-defining inequalities for the MCGP to obtain facet-defining inequalities for the MEP. Finally, we present a mixed-integer extension of the MEP and show how to obtain valid inequalities for general MIPs using facets of the MEP.</br>
