Title: Product Introduction Against a Predator: A Bilevel Mixed-Integer Programming Approach<br>Author: Churlzu Lim, Assistant Professor, UNC-Charlotte, 9201 University City Blvd., College of Engineering, Charlotte, NC, 28223, United States, clim2@uncc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith, Aydin Alptekinoglu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider a Stackelberg game in which two firms, a leader and a follower, sequentially determine subsets of potentially marketable products. The market is assumed to be segmented so that each segment has its own preference list. The objective is to maximize the leader's profit under the follower's predatory strategy. We formulate this problem as an integer program, propose cutting plane algorithms and heuristics, and derive insights from solutions of test instances.
