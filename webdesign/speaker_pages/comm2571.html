Problem is recognized as the Pick-up and Delivery VRPTW. Initial solution for the problem is obtained by CWTDH algorithm which is further optimized using SA metaheuristics and lambda-interchange heuristics. Also, post optimisation technique was used for single route improvements. To validate the calculated solution, a test drive was performed to insure that every news stand will be served on time.
