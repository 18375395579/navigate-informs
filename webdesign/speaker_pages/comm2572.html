In particular, using convex extensions, we show that the convex hull for the unbounded case can be expressed as the disjunctive hull of single-term unbounded bilinear integer knapsack sets. We incorporate the derived inequalities within a branch-and-cut framework and conduct computational experiments to investigate their strength.</br>
