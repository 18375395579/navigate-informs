Title: Strong Valid Inequalities for Bilinear Integer Knapsack Sets<br>Author: Kwanghun Chung, School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, 315 N.

In particular, using convex extensions, we show that the convex hull for the unbounded case can be expressed as the disjunctive hull of single-term unbounded bilinear integer knapsack sets. We incorporate the derived inequalities within a branch-and-cut framework and conduct computational experiments to investigate their strength.
