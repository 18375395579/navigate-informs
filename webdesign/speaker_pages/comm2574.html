<br>Title: A Hub-and-Spoke Supply Chain Design for Biomass Co-Fire in Power Plants</br><br>Author: Sandra Eksioglu, Associate Professor, Mississippi State University, PO Box 9542  206 McCain Engineering Bld., MSSTATE, MS, 39762, United States of America, sde47@ise.msstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Md Roni, Erin Searcy</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a hub-and-spoke supply chain design for biomass cofire in power plants. This design relies on high-volume, long-haul transportation of densified biomass to power plants by railways. We develop a bender’s decomposition heuristic to solve the problem. The goal of the numerical experiments is to show if there is a benefit of using high-volume, long-haul transportation to increase biomass supply, or relying on local resources. We use the billion ton study data to validate our results.</br>
