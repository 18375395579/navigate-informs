<br>Title: Application of Vehicle Routing and Multiperiod Assignment Problem to UAV Planning</br><br>Author: Rafael Aleman, Graduate Research Assistant, Wright State University, 207 Russ Center, 3640 Colonel Glen Highway, Dayton, OH, 45435, United States, aleman.2@wright.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xinhui Zhang, Raymond Hill</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This project addresses assignment of a set of unmanned aerial vehicles to a set of mobile military targets which follow known trajectories over time. A neighborhood-based metaheuristic is developed to match vehicles and targets over time by decomposing the problem into a multiple depot (MDVRP) and split delivery (SDVRP) vehicle routing problem with mobile customers. Our approach introduces a new variant for the VRP and allows obtaining near optimal solutions in a reasonable computational time.</br>
