Title: Metaheuristics for the Stochastic Inventory Routing Problem<br>Author: Arne Lokketangen, Arne.Lokketangen@hiMolde.no<br>Coauthor(s): Lars Hvattum, Gilbert Laporte<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We address the Stochastic Inventory Routing Problem, where the stochasticity is in demands of the customers. Heuristic solution methods are proposed, based on using infinite scenario trees to approximate the underlying Markov Decision Process. The scenario tree based methods are more general than previously proposed solution methods, and the computational results are promising.
