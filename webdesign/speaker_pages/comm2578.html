This meta-heuristic relies on problem specific route evaluation and assignment components, along with generic implementations of Split procedures, local-search improvement methods, and genetic operators. In addition, a bi-criteria evaluation of individuals, driven by the contribution to the diversity of the population and the solution quality, enables to enhance exploration capabilities and reduce the risks of premature convergence. High-quality results are reported for a wide range of vehicle routing variants.</br>
