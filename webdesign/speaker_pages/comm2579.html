In the first stage, crew compatible families are assigned, and in the second stage, after most of the demand has been realized, aircrafts within each family are allocated. Demand uncertainty is represented by various scenarios in the second stage.  The solution approach uses design and analysis of computer experiments. This is compared to a traditional Benders?approach.</br>
