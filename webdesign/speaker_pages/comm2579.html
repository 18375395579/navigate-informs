Title: A Computer Experiments Approach for Solving a Two-Stage Airline Fleet Assignment Model<br>Author: Venkata Pilla, The University of Texas at Arlington, PO BOX 19017, Arlington, TX, United States, pillaprasad@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger, Victoria Chen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A statistics-based solution approach for a two-stage stochastic fleet assignment model is presented.  In the first stage, crew compatible families are assigned, and in the second stage, after most of the demand has been realized, aircrafts within each family are allocated. Demand uncertainty is represented by various scenarios in the second stage.  The solution approach uses design and analysis of computer experiments. This is compared to a traditional Benders?approach.
