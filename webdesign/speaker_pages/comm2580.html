We construct a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) that models these decisions in the presence of a stochastically improving competitor.  We then formulate the static problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program, whose parameters we obtain by making a value function approximation in our SMDP.  We report numerical results.</br>
