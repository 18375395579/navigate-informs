Title: Hydrogen Charging Station Location Analysis with Scheduling and Routing Considerations<br>Author: Jamie Kang, Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Irvine, 4000 AIRB, Irvine, CA, United States of America, jekang@uci.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Will Recker<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A facility location problem with full-day scheduling and routing considerations is proposed for hydrogen refueling stations in the early adoption stage. The model uses the set covering model as a location strategy, and the Household Activity Pattern Problem as the scheduling and routing tool.  The formulation isolates each vehicle’s routing problem from other vehicles as well as the set covering problem, and uses a modified column generation that finds a column with a negative reduced price.
