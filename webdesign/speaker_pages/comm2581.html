The model uses the set covering model as a location strategy, and the Household Activity Pattern Problem as the scheduling and routing tool.  The formulation isolates each vehicle’s routing problem from other vehicles as well as the set covering problem, and uses a modified column generation that finds a column with a negative reduced price.</br>
