First, three priority rules with a dynamic programming are proposed for rescheduling to solve resource conflictions. Then remaining problems of non-critical chain extension and critical chain break are removed by a heuristic algorithm through decreasing feeding buffer size gradually. Finally, a simulation experiment is set up to test the algorithm.
