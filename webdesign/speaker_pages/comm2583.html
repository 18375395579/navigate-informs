Title: Novel Optimization Models for Abnormal Brain Activity Classification<br>Author: Art Chaovaitwongse, Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Rd, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, wchaoval@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ya-Ju Fan, Rajesh Sachdeo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a new classification technique, called Support Feature Machine (SFM), for multidimensional time series data. The proposed technique was applied to the classification of abnormal brain activity represented in electroencephalograms (EEGs). The idea is to optimize the electrode selection such that the selected electrodes show a good separability between two classes. The results suggest that the proposed technique can be used in practical settings of brain diagnosis.
