The objective of this problem is to minimize the cumulative amount of flow through the network over a finite horizon.  We propose a hybrid integer and constraint programming method that takes advantage of the structure of the interdiction and scheduling decisions.  Our method is tested on realistic instances based on a small city.</br>
