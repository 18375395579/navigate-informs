We proposed a new robust freight service network design model with vehicle rerouting options. The proposed model explicitly introduces a set of integer variables for vehicle rerouting in the stochastic program. Although  computationally expensive, the resultant model provides more options  and flexibility for planners to deal with uncertainties more effectively.</br>
