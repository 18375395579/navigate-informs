Title: Stochastic Network Design with Rerouting<br>Author: Ruibin Bai, Associate Professor, University of Nottingham Ningbo, 199 Taikang East Road, Ningbo, China, ruibin.bai@nottingham.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Stein Wallace<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Service network design under uncertainty is fundamentally crucial for all freight transportation companies. We proposed a new robust freight service network design model with vehicle rerouting options. The proposed model explicitly introduces a set of integer variables for vehicle rerouting in the stochastic program. Although  computationally expensive, the resultant model provides more options  and flexibility for planners to deal with uncertainties more effectively.
