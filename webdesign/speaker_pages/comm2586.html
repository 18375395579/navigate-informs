Title: Flexible Solutions to Maritime Inventory Routing Problems with Delivery Time Windows<br>Author: Chengliang Zhang, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, United States of America, czhang85@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Myun-Seok Cheon, Ahmet Keha, Joel Sokol, George Nemhauser<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a Maritime Inventory Routing Problem with Time Windows (MIRPTW) with uncertain travel disruptions. The goal is to generate flexible solutions that can withstand these disruptions. We add soft constraints that provide robustness to the solutions.  These constraints are dualized and we explore solutions obtained with different multipliers. To evaluate the flexibility of solutions, we use a simulator that generates disruptions and recovery solutions.
