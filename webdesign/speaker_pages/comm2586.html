The goal is to generate flexible solutions that can withstand these disruptions. We add soft constraints that provide robustness to the solutions.  These constraints are dualized and we explore solutions obtained with different multipliers. To evaluate the flexibility of solutions, we use a simulator that generates disruptions and recovery solutions.</br>
