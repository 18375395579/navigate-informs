Meyer, Warren D'Souza, Leyuan Shi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose an iterative linear programming (LP) approach for Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose optimization. In contrast to using column generation to solve the large-scale LP, each sub-problem is generated row-wise. Interconnection of the sub-problems is maintained by overall dose distribution and updating all aperture weights. Our approach was tested on challenging clinical cases and achieved superior critical structure sparing. Convergence of our approach is also demonstrated.
