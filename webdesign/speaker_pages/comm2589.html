<br>Title: A Moment Approach to Pricing Exotic Options Under Regime-switching</br><br>Author: Michael Kim, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, kimmi@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Li, Roy Kwon</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider deriving tight bounds for the price of a wide class of exotic options under regime switching. Our method enables a general class of polynomial-type stochastic differential equations to be considered for underlying price dynamics. The novelty of our method is to represent the moment structure of the underlying asset dynamics via semi-definite constraints, and to subsequently derive the bounds of the option price using semi-definite programming.</br>
