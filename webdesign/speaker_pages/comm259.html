Title: An Efficient Benders Decomposition Algorithm for Chance-constraint MIP<br>Author: Yu An, University of South Florida, 4202 E Fowler Ave, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, yan2@mail.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng, Ludwig Kuznia<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Chance-constrained stochastic program with a finite support is often formulated using big-M method, which makes it computationally challenging. We adopt Benders decomposition strategy to develop our algorithm that does not assume a large big-M.  Various improvement methods of Benders are also applied to achieve better performance. Numerical results will be presented.
