Title: What's New in Coopr IV<br>Author: David L. Woodruff, University of California-Davis, Graduate School of Management, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, dlwoodruff@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Paul Watson, John D. Siirola, William E. Hart<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We describe new features in the open-source software for modeling and optimization called Coopr. The Python-based algebraic modeling language Pyomo is being extended in many ways including the provision of user-defined workflows, more efficiency, and model blocks for specifying aggregations of model components. The PySP stochastic programming package has expanded support for chance constraints, automatic computation of the expected value of a stochastic solution, and numerous other extensions.
