Walteros<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Evacuation management is of utmost importance for the well-being of every modern society. In this presentation, we emphasize on large-scale evacuation of metropolitan areas. The problem, being extremely large, is almost impossible to solve without employing a decomposition of the network at hand. We present an approach to effectively decompose the problem in a series of smaller evacuation problems and, then, effectively combine the optimal solutions provided by the approximate subproblems.
