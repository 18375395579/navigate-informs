In this presentation, we emphasize on large-scale evacuation of metropolitan areas. The problem, being extremely large, is almost impossible to solve without employing a decomposition of the network at hand. We present an approach to effectively decompose the problem in a series of smaller evacuation problems and, then, effectively combine the optimal solutions provided by the approximate subproblems.</br>
