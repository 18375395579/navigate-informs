<br>Title: Portfolio Risk Management with Moment Matching Approach</br><br>Author: Elcin Cetinkaya, Doctoral Student, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue Unit:12, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, elc209@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aurelie Thiele</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the problem minimizing the probability of obtaining a portfolio return less than a threshold while keeping the expected portfolio return no worse than a target. We propose a tractable solution involving an algorithm based on log-Normally distributed stock returns assumption and the Fenton-Wilkinson approximation method to the problem difficult to solve using exact methods. We compare its performance to that of some benchmark methods. We extend our approach to design basket options</br>
