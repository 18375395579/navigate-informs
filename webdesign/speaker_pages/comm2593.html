Cole Smith, Associate Professor, University of Florida, ISE Department, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, cole@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hanif D. Sherali</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a new linearized model for the 0-1 quadratic programming problem, whose size is linear in terms of the number of variables in the original nonlinear problem.  In this talk, we discuss three alternative reformulations, each varying in model size and tightness.  We also discuss the theoretical relationship of our models to the standard linearization of such problems, and provide computational results that test the relative efficacy of each formulation.</br>
