Title: Enhancement of a Simulation Based Dynamic-equilibrium Assignment Method<br>Author: Michael Florian, INRO Consultants Inc, Montreal, Canada, mike@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Mahut, Nicolas Tremblay<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper reports on the evaluation of alternative dynamic-equilibrium assignment methods for use with a simulation based dynamic traffic assignment method. Since the realism of a traffic simulation model results in an assignment map which is discontinuous and difficult to characterize analytically, the solution methods are inspired from mathematical programming methods used for variational inequalities but are applied in a heuristic way. This paper evaluates variants of the solution algorithm inspired by gradient-based methods used in static equilibrium models These methods are applied in conjunction with a dynamic step-size adjustment technique The tests are executed on several congested urban networks of significant size (up to 6500 links) from North America and Europe compare the results of these methods with the popular MSA method.
