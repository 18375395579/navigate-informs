Title: Stochastic Multi-portfolio Optimization: Threshold Boolean Programming Model and Solution<br>Author: Ran Ji, George Washington University, 2201 G St, NW, Funger Hall 415, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, jiran@gwmail.gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Miguel A. Lejeune<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose multi-portfolio optimization models including each a joint chance constraint with multi-row random technology matrix representing discretely distributed random asset returns. The probability of each portfolio’s return below a level is upper-bounded by a low value. We use threshold Boolean method to obtain linear inequalities defining sufficient conditions for the chance constraint to hold, derive a deterministic equivalent MIP reformulation. Computational results will be presented.
