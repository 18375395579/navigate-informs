Title: Scheduling Summer Programs at the AF Academy via Integer Programming<br>Author: Andrew Armacost, Associate Professor of OR, US Air Force Academy, 2354 Fairchild Drive, Suite 6J100, USAFA, CO, 80840, United States, Andy.Armacost@usafa.af.mil<br>Coauthor(s): Johnathon Dulin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Each of the 4000 cadets at the AF Academy must be scheduled for multiple programs over their nine-week summer period.  We develop and solve a binary integer program to generate a workable solution.  This model, now being integrated into the campus-wide information system, dramatically reduces the number of unscheduled cadets.  It also provides the human scheduler insight into how program enrollment levels affect schedule feasibility.
