<br>Title: Additive Approximations for Bounded Degree Survivable Network Design</br><br>Author: Mohit Singh, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, United States of America, mohits@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lap Lau</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the minimum cost survivable network design problem with degree constraints on vertices. We design approximation algorithms that minimize the total cost and the degree violation simultaneously. We present a polynomial time algorithm which returns a solution with cost at most twice the optimal cost and where the degree bounds are violated by a small additive constant depending on the connectivity requirement.</br>
