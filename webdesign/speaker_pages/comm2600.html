Title: Wind Power Bidding with Chance Constraints<br>Author: Jianhui Wang, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, 60439, United States of America, jianhui.wang@anl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Qianfan Wang, Yongpei Guan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: An optimal wind power bidding strategy with chance constraints will be presented in this talk. The chance constraints are used to enforce that a certain percentage of wind power be utilized. The problem is solved through Sample Average Approximation (SAA).
