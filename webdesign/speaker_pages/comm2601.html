The procedure takes as input a sequence of candidate solutions and generates an optimality gap estimate with increasing sample size. We discuss rules to stop the procedure and increase the sample size. We provide conditions under which this procedure (i) terminates with probability one and (ii) terminates with a solution that has a small optimality gap with a prespecified probability and present computational results.</br>
