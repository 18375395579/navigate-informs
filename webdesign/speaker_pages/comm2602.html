A mixed variable programming (MVP) problem is formulated, in which the decision variables are the number and types of materials and the thicknesses of each layer. The objective is to minimize the difference between the data and an Abel transform model of the configuration. Numerical results, using the mixed variable pattern search algorithm are presented for several test configurations.</br>
