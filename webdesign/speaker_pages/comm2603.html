Title: A Scenario-based Approach for Operating Theater Scheduling Under Uncertainty<br>Author: Nickolas Freeman, PhD Candidate, University of Alabama, Box 870226, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487, United States of America, nkfreeman@cba.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sharif Melouk, John Mittenthal<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We schedule elective surgical procedures with duration uncertainty in operating rooms while maintaining flexibility to service urgent procedures before a user specified duration elapses. A mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation incorporates the uncertainty by determining a global operation schedule that satisfies multiple sets of scenario specific constraints. A two-step solution approach minimizes the weighted sum of deviations of actual surgical start times from their planned start times.
