Title: Multiobjective Multi-State Genetic Algorithm for Power Systems Reliability Optimization Problems<br>Author: Heidi Taboada, Graduate Student, Rutgers University, Department of Industrial Engineering, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854-8018, United States, heidita@eden.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Coit, Jose Espiritu Nolasco<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A multiobjective multi-state genetic algorithm (MOMS-GA) was developed to solve multiple objective reliability optimization design problems of multi-state power systems. The multiobjective genetic algorithm developed uses the universal moment generating function approach (UMGF) to evaluate the different reliability indices of the power system. The solution to the multiobjective multi-state (MOMS) problem is a set of solutions, known as Pareto front.
