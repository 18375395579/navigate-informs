<br>Title: An Exact Solution Approach for Stochastic Integer Portfolio Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Miguel Lejeune, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, mlejeune@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pierre Bonami</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop an exact solution method for portfolio optimization problems in which uncertainty in the estimate of the expected return and real-life market restriction modeled with integer constraints are simultaneously considered. We use a non-linear branch-and-bound algorithm and implement a new branching priority rule. Computational results on problems containing up to 200 assets are reported and benchmarked with others methods and solvers.</br>
