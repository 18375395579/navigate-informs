Manzour, University of Oklahoma, Oak 2900, Norman, United States of America, smh.manzour@ou.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Location Routing Problem is an important logistical problem that comprises two of the main logistical drivers namely facility location and vehicle routing. We focus on the Planar Single-Facility LRP with Euclidean distance. A hierarchical heuristic-based method is put forward which continuously takes into account information from the routing results while systematically improving the location using the end points of the obtained routes. The proposed method outperformed the existing approaches.</br>
