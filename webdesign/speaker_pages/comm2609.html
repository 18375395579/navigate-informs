Empirical evidence shows the effectiveness of our algorithm in practice. For most instances in the literature, we obtain solutions that are either optimal or a fraction of a percentage point away from it. For instances created with the sole purpose of being hard to tackle, our algorithm can get very close to optimality if given enough time.</br>
