Besides the notion of erratic effects on the solve process, ideas to exploit degeneracy in branch and cut have emerged.  This talk will present in details the choices made in Sulum MIP optimizer, especially focusing on the cutting loop and how the interaction with degeneracy exploiting heuristics is beneficial.</br>
