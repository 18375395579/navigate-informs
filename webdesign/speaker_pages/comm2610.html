We present a design methodology that identifies all the Pareto-optimal configurations with respect to a cost and risk of a material handling system.  The algorithm is structured such that the master problem makes the risk tradeoffs and the sub problem embeds the material handling system knowledge.  Numerical experience will be shared.
