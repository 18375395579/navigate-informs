Title: A Branch-and-cut Approach for the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem with Generalized Upper Bound Constraints<br>Author: Elif Gokce, Texas A&M University, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, TAMUS 3131, College Station, TX, 77843-3131, United States of America, elifg@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wilbert Wilhelm<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We derive facet defining valid inequalities for the knapsack problem with generalized upper bound constraints. We then use the inequalities as cuts in a branch-and-cut scheme and report computational results.
