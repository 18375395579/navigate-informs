Title: A Lagrangian-based Procedure for Cyclic Nurse Scheduling<br>Author: Jonathan Bard, Professor, The University of Texas, 1 University Station C2200, Mechanical Engineering, Austin, TX, 78712-0292, United States, jbard@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hadi Purnomo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk addresses the problem of developing cyclic schedules for nurses while taking into account individual preferences. An integer programming formulation is given and then decomposed using Lagrangian relaxation. After the Lagrangian dual was solved, there was no clear way to perform branch and bound so a variable fixing scheme was introduced to improve the results.  The full algorithm was tested on instances with up to 100 nurses and 20 rotational profiles.
