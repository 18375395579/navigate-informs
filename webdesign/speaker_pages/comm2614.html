<br>Title: Optimally Locating Charging Stations for Serving Plug-in Electric Vehicular Flows</br><br>Author: Nan Jiang, University of Texas Austin, Austin, TX, United States of America, jiang@utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chi Xie</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: An optimal location problem of where to build public charging stations for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in an equilibrium network is formulated and solved.  The model is of a bi-level structure, with its upper level minimizing the network-wide travel cost subject to the budget constraint and its lower level characterizing PEV driver’s route choice behavior shaped by the en-route charging requirement. A nested partition method is implemented and evaluated for solving the problem.</br>
