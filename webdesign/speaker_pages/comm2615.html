Dearing, Professor, Clemson University, P O Box 340975, Clemson, SC, 29634-0975, United States, pmdrn@CLEMSON.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christiane Zeck</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A dual algorithm is presented that solves the min-max problem in R^n over a sequence of subsets S of the given points.  If a subproblem is not optimal, a new point is added to the set S and an existing point is replaced.  The min-max solution to the new set is determined by following directions based on bisectors.</br>
