Title: An Open-Source API for Nonlinear Programming Problems.<br>Author: Michael E. Henderson, mhender@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: I will describe the current COIN-OR Open-source project NLPAPI, which is a C API (though object-oriented) for defining and solving nonlinear programming problems. At present the project relies on LANCELOT's group partial separable function structure, while allowing also for single-function objective and constraints. Future plans include a more generally structured function, and an OSI interface when the problems defined are linear.
