Title: A Stochastic Network-interdiction Model for Cyber Security<br>Author: Mehmet Ertem, Graduate Student, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, 3237 Mechanical Engineering Building, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, ertem@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vicki Bier<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a general defender-attacker model for security of computer networks, using attack graphs to represent possible attacker and defender options. The defender's objective is to maximize the security of the network under a limited budget. The attacker's success or failure on any arc of the attack graph is probabilistic. To represent the ability of the attacker to launch multiple attempts, we formulate the resulting problem as a multiple-stage stochastic network-interdiction problem.
