The defender's objective is to maximize the security of the network under a limited budget. The attacker's success or failure on any arc of the attack graph is probabilistic. To represent the ability of the attacker to launch multiple attempts, we formulate the resulting problem as a multiple-stage stochastic network-interdiction problem.</br>
