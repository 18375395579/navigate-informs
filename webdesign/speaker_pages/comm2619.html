Title: Multiobjective Simulation Optimization: A Comparison of Methods<br>Author: Hugh Medal, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, United States of America, hmedal@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ed Pohl<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Large-scale complex systems are characterized by complex input-output relationships and often have multiple performance measures. The many decision variables and system complexity render simulation and classic optimization techniques inadequate if used alone for optimization. We give a multi-objective genetic algorithm for simulation-based optimization, and compare the performance of this algorithm versus OptQuest commercial software when optimizing a military aircraft transportation model.
