<br>Title: Numerical Solution of Large Scale Moment Problem in Case of Piecewise Higher Order Convex Objective</br><br>Author: Anh Ninh, Rutgers Center of Operations Research, Rutgers University, Piscataway, United States of America, ninhtuananh@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gabriela Alexe, Andras Prekopa</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose efficient numerical solution for the (continuous) power moment problem where the objective function is piecewise higher order convex. The solution goes through the solution of discrete moment problems with Vandermonde matrices in the equality constraints. Problems with up to 30 moments can efficiently be solved but we can go higher in special cases. Numerical results will be reported.</br>
