Title: OR and the MCM<br>Author: Michael Spivey, University of Puget Sound, CMB 1043, Tacoma, WA, 98416, United States of America, mspivey@ups.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Mathematical Contest in Modeling is an annual competition that requires teams of students to spend four days constructing a solution to an ill-constrained, real-world problem.  Recent problems have included designing an efficient airline boarding method and modeling the effects of global warming on the Florida coast.  In this talk I will discuss how the MCM can be used to teach operations research, and I will describe some of how we approach the MCM at the University of Puget Sound.
