Due to this motivation, many corresponding solution methods are developed. We present several constrained stochastic integer programming (SIP) models to study these problems under uncertainty. We compare deterministic Q01 and SIP algorithms in this context. We also attempt to generalize the modeling framework to stochastic pseudo-Boolean optimization.</br>
