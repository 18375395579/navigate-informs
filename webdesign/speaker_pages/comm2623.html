<br>Title: A Heuristic for the Driver Scheduling Problem in Passenger Rail Transportation</br><br>Author: Dung-Ying Lin, National Cheng Kung University, 1 University Road, Transportation Management, Tainan City, Ch, 70101, Taiwan - ROC, dylin@mail.ncku.edu.tw</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pak Weng Leong</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: To solve the driver scheduling problem in a passenger railway transport system, we developed a two-stage heuristic. In the first stage, a search algorithm generates candidate duties that do not violate the contractual working rules. In the second stage, a selection heuristic efficiently selects duties to cover a published timetable. The proposed approach is applied to a company to verify its effectiveness. The promising results demonstrate that our method can solve real-world problems.</br>
