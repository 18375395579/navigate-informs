<br>Title: Dominance Constrained Stochastic Programs for Energy System Operation</br><br>Author: Ruediger Schultz, Professor, Duisburg-Essen University, Forsthausweg 2, 47057 Duisburg, Duisburg, Germany, schultz@math.uni-duisburg.de</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider random optimization problems in energy systems operation for which the framework of two-stage stochastic programming is one possible modeling alternative. Rather than optimizing expectations or mean-risk expressions of recourse functionals, we set up models where the recourse functionals occur within stochastic dominance constraints. We analyze these models, propose decomposition algorithms for their numerical treatment, and conclude with computational results.</br>
