Title: UAV Search Optimization under Uncertain Reward<br>Author: Yan Xia, Industrial and System Engineering Department, University at Buffalo, 342 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260-2050, United States of America, yanxia@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rajan Batta, Rakesh Nagi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This talk develops a stochastic and dynamic model of the time allocation problem for a UAV search mission. Reward is not deterministic.  Instead, a random event during the search determines reward.  Upper bounds and a concavity result allow development of an efficient optimal procedure.  We numerically compare the reward under the optimal strategy and under two human intuitive strategies, and find significant optimality gaps in both planning horizon and searching horizon.
