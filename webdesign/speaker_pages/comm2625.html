Reward is not deterministic.  Instead, a random event during the search determines reward.  Upper bounds and a concavity result allow development of an efficient optimal procedure.  We numerically compare the reward under the optimal strategy and under two human intuitive strategies, and find significant optimality gaps in both planning horizon and searching horizon.</br>
