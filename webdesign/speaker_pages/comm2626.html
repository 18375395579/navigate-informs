<br>Title: Exact Computable Representation of Some Second-order Cone Constrained Quadratic Optimizations</br><br>Author: Qingwei Jin, Assistant Professor, Zhejiang University, Department of Management Science and Eng, Hangzhou, 310058, China, qingweijin@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shu-Cherng Fang, Ye Tian, Wenxun Xing</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Solving the quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem is in general NP-hard. Only a few subclasses of the QCQP problem are known to be polynomial-time solvable. We provide exact computable representations for some more subclasses of the QCQP problem, in particular, the subclass with one second-order cone constraint and two special linear constraints.</br>
