<br>Title: Exploiting Separability in Outer-Approximation Methods</br><br>Author: Hassan Hijazi, National ICT Australia, 7 London Cct, Canberra, 2601, Australia, Hassan.Hijazi@nicta.com.au</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A common structure in convex mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) is separable nonlinear functions. In the presence of such structures, we propose a number of improvements to the outer approximation algorithms. As a side result, we exhibit a simple MINLP model where a classical implementation of the outer approximation would take an exponential number of iterations, whereas the new formulation would converge linearly.</br>
