Title: Mixed Convexity and Optimization<br>Author: Emre Tokgoz, Faculty - Lecturer, University of Oklahoma, 601 Elm Ave. Room 423, Norman, OK, 73019, United States of America, Emre.Tokgoz-1@ou.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hillel Kumin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this work mixed convexity of mixed variable functions and the corresponding mixed Hessian matrices will be introduced. In addition, mixed convexity and optimization results will be obtained. Several examples from telecommunication systems, inventory models, and management Science will be given as applications of the results obtained.
