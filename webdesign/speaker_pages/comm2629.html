Title: Approximation Methods for Pricing under Nested the Logit Model<br>Author: W. Zachary Rayfield, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, wzr2@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paat Rusmevichientong, Huseyin Topaloglu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present approximation methods for pricing problems under the nested logit model. Our methods obtain solutions with an approximation guarantee of (1+\delta) with computational work growing at rate 1 / \delta.
