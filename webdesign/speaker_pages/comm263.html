We propose a possible way to exploit random variability at the root node of a branch-and-cut algorithm, by performing multiple root cut loops in a parallel fashion. The idea is to enforce some random diversification in the alternative cut loops, in order to collect more cutting planes and a (possibly) better incumbent solution. We provide benchmark results to analyze the performance impact of the proposed approach.</br>
