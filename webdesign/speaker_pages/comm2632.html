Title: Equitable Redesign of the Existing Public Transit Route Networks: A Bi-level Optimization Approach<br>Author: Wei Fan, Associate Professor, The University of Texas at Tyler, Department of Civil Engineering, 3900 University Blvd, Tyler, TX, 75799, United States of America, wfan@uttyler.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A bi-level optimization model is formulated, which can explicitly account for the spatial equity, for solving the public transit route network redesign problem (PTNRP). A genetic algorithm based solution approach is developed to solving this PTNRP bi-level optimization model. Network experiments are conducted. Numerical results and related characteristics are also described in detail.
