Title: Efficient Branch and Bound Algorithms for Solving Time-dependent Stochastic Shortest Path Problem<br>Author: Xuesong Zhou, University of Utah, 110 Central Campus Dr, MCE 2000, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, zhou@eng.utah.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lixing Yang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Several reformulations will be presented for finding the a priori least expected time paths in a time-dependent and stochastic network using a sample-based representation for link travel times. The proposed models can be easily dualized by a Lagrangian relaxation approach. A branch and bound based sub-gradient algorithm is developed to improve solution quality.
