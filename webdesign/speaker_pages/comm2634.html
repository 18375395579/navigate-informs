Title: Determining the Optimal Search Area for a Serial Criminal<br>Author: Mike O'Leary, Towson University, Department of Mathematics, Towson University, Towson, MD, 21252, United States of America, moleary@towson.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The geographic profiling problem in criminology is to determine a search area for an offender based on knowledge of the offenders crime locations. We describe a new mathematical method for this problem that is able to incorporate geographic and demographic features that influence the selection of a crime site and uses Bayesian methods to generate its predictions. We will present the software tool that we have developed to solve this problem and give examples of its use.
