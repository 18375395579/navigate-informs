Title: Belief Propagation and Linear Programming<br>Author: Mohsen Bayati, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052, United States of America, bayati@stanfordalumni.org<br>Coauthor(s): Christian Borgs, Jennifer Chayes, Riccardo Zecchina<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) is an iterative, message-passing algorithm for  making inference in graphical models. We study the relationship between the convergence and correcness of the BP and integrality of linear programming (LP) in the context of combinatorial optimizaiton problems.  We show some theoretical results which shed more light on this often noted but poorly understood connection.
