Based on the martingale duality approach we propose an algorithm to generate tight upper bounds on the Bermudan option price under the jump-diffusion setting, where an approximation of the optimal martingale is derived without nested simulation but preserves the martingale property. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.</br>
