Following this postponement concept, a product is not necessarily finished at the production site. Instead different manufacturing steps may be executed while the product is shipped to the customer. In this paper, we extend excisting quantitative models allowing for decision making for specific postponement implementations in uncertain environments. We provide state-of-the-art implementations of specialized solution algorithms to solve related stochastic programming models. Namely, we apply a parallelized implementation of the L-Shaped method for two-stage and multi-stage stochastic programming models with mixed-binary first stage. As a result of our new settings we successfully show that the earlier models may be extended in a meaningful way and getting solutions based on standard solvers is possible even in more realistic settings than done before.</br>
