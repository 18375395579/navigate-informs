At specific locations, symbols are placed and scaled to make their areas proportional to the magnitude of the data. We present a novel IP model to draw opaque disks on a map while maximizing the visible border of all disks. We implement new decompositions and facets in a branch-and-cut algorithm, and are the first to optimally solve real instances of this problem.</br>
