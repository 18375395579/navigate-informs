Title: Delay Constrained Minimum Power Broadcasting in Wireless Networks<br>Author: Kerem Bulbul, Assistant Prof., Sabanci University, Manufacturing Systems & Industrial Eng., Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, 34956, Turkey, bulbul@sabanciuniv.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozgur Ercetin, Tonguc Unluyurt<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the minimum power broadcasting problem in an ad hoc wireless network operating under a hard constraint on the end-to-end delay between the source and each node in the network. We first characterize the optimal solution to a closely related problem in dense networks using a dynamic programming (DP) formulation. The insights provided by the structure of the optimal DP solution lead to effective algorithms for the original problem, and we demonstrate their performance computationally.
