The lower bound is obtained via the dual problem, whose solution is used to construct a feasible solution upper bound. The algorithm runs in linear time, in contrast to the polynomial-time method of Vavasis (1992) yielding local optima. Experiments show that our method produces better upper bounds than Vavasis more efficiently.</br>
