<br>Title: On the Copositive Representation of Binary and Continuous Nonconvex Quadratic Programs</br><br>Author: Samuel Burer, University of Iowa, S346 Pappajohn Business Building, Henry B. Tippie College of Business, Iowa City, IA, 52242-1994, United States of America, samuel-burer@uiowa.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We show that any nonconvex quadratic program having a mix of  binary and continuous variables can be  represented as a linear program over the dual of the cone of copositive  matrices. This result can be viewed as an extension of earlier separate  results, which have established the copositive representation of a small  collection of NP-hard problems.</br>
