<br>Title: Simulation Screening Experiments using LASSO-optimal Supersaturated Design and Analysis: A Maritime Operations Application</br><br>Author: Dadi Xing, Purdue University, 134 Nimitz Dr Apt 8, West Lafayette, In, 47906-3357, United States of America, dxing@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hong Wan, Yu Zhu, Turgut Kaymal, Susan Sanchez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Lasso is a popular method for variable selection. Based on the correct selection probabilities of LASSO with finite samples, we proposed new criteria to generate supersaturated design and algorithm to select the optimal tuning parameters for LASSO model selection. We apply this new method to an agent-based simulation of maritime escort operations, and compare the results with Cross Validation, AIC, and BIC. Our numerical evaluation shows that our new method is more efficient and flexible.</br>
