<br>Title: Fenchel and Disjunctive Decomposition for Mean-Risk Stochastic Integer Programs</br><br>Author: Michelle M. Alvarado, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, michelle.mcgaha@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lewis Ntaimo, Guglielmo Lulli</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Mean-risk stochastic integer programs (SIPs) include both expectation and a dispersion statistic in the objective function and are hard to solve. In this talk, we introduce integrated Fenchel and disjunctive decomposition for mean-risk SIPs with fixed recourse.  This new methodology is subgradient-based and generates Fenchel cuts based on a subset of scenarios and uses disjunctive programming to lift and translate the cuts so that they are valid for other scenarios.</br>
