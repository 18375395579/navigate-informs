<br>Title: Model and Algorithm for Robust Vehicle Routing Problem with Deadlines</br><br>Author: Yossiri Adulyasak, Postdoctoral Associate, Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), 1 CREATE Way, #10-01 CREATE Tower, Singapore, 138602, Singapore, yossiri@smart.mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Jaillet</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a routing problem under travel time uncertainty where deadlines are imposed at a subset of nodes. The objective of the problem is to optimize a performance measure, called lateness index, which represents the risk of violating the deadlines. We introduce a formulation and a decomposition algorithm that can be generalized to solve the problem with multiple capacitated vehicles.</br>
