Title: Scheduling a Large Open-pit Mining Operation<br>Author: Eduardo Moreno, Universidad Adolfo Ibañez, School of Engineering, Chile, eduardo.moreno@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Espinoza, Marcos Goycoolea<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a collection of medium to large sized open-pit copper  mines in Chile. Given precedence  relationships and capacity limits over time, we obtain  provably good feasible solutions as fast as possible by  incorporating a simple rounding heuristic, pre-processing techniques, and cutting planes in a branch and bound algorithm to solve a classical integer program. We present computational results using the CPLEX solver.
