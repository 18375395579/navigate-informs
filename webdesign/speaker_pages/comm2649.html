We prove that if the tensor is rank-one, then the embedded matrix must be rank-one too, and vice versa. The tensor PCA problem can thus be solved by means of matrix optimization under a rank-one constraint. We propose two convex relaxations for the rank-one constrained problem. Our numerical results show that both relaxations produce rank-one solutions with high probability.
