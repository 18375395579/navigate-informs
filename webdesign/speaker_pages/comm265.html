<br>Title: LAGO on the Unit Sphere</br><br>Author: Mu Zhu, Associate Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, m3zhu@uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexandra Laflamme-Sanders</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: LAGO is an efficient kernel algorithm designed specifically for the rare target detection problem but, unlike other kernel algorithms, one cannot easily use LAGO with many domain-specific kernels. We solve this problem by first providing a unified framework for LAGO and clarifying its basic principle, and then applying that principle on the unit sphere instead of in the Euclidean space.</br>
