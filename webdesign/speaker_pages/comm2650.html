Title: A Generic Benders Decomposition Algorithm for the AIMMS Modeling Language<br>Author: Marcel Hunting, Paragon Decision Technology, Schipholweg 1, Haarlem, 2034 LS, Netherlands, Marcel.Hunting@aimms.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present an implementation of Benders Decomposition, in the AIMMS modeling language, that is easy to use on a broad class of problems. The user only needs to specify which variables belong to the master problem and which to the subproblems. Benders?cuts are generated automatically. Several cut selection criteria are available. The Benders Decomposition algorithm is implemented as a white box algorithm.
