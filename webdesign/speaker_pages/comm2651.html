It is shown that the algorithm minimizes total expected delay, when there is a probability of the ground delay program canceling earlier than originally planned. A constrained version of the algorithm address both equity and efficiency of slot allocation. Experiments performed with realistic flight schedules exhibit superior overall performance of the algorithm compared to existing procedures.
