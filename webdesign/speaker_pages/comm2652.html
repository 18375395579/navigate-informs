Specifically, we develop an algorithm for the models with a general demand process and an algorithm for the models with an independent and non-decreasing demand process. We show that these two algorithms have worse-case performance guarantees between 2 and 3 and 2, respectively. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate near optimal performances for both algorithms.
