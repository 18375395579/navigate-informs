Title: Directed Principal Component Analysis<br>Author: Yi-Hao Kao, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, edward@yhkao.com<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Van Roy<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a problem involving estimation of a high-dimensional covariance matrix that  is the sum of a diagonal matrix and a low-rank matrix, and making a decision based on the  resulting estimate. Such problems arise, for example, in portfolio management, where a common  approach employs principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate factors used in constructing  the low-rank term of the covariance matrix. The decision problem is typically treated separately,  with the estimated covariance matrix taken to be an input to an optimization problem. We propose  directed PCA, an efficient algorithm that takes the decision objective into account when  estimating the covariance matrix. Directed PCA effectively adjusts factors that would be produced  by PCA so that they better guide the specific decision at hand. We demonstrate through  computational studies that directed PCA yields significant benefit, and we prove theoretical  results establishing that the degree of improvement over conventional PCA can be unbounded.
