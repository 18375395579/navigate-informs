Title: Global Equilibrium Search Applied to the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Optimization Problem<br>Author: Shylo Oleg, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, shylo@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Pardalos, Oleg Prokopyev, Volodymyr Shylo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe heuristic approaches for solving the unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problem based on a global equilibrium search (GES) framework. We investigate  performance of the proposed approaches and compare them with the best available solver on well-known benchmarks instances. The reported computational results indicate a high efficiency of the developed algorithm.
