Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, shylo@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Pardalos, Oleg Prokopyev, Volodymyr Shylo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe heuristic approaches for solving the unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problem based on a global equilibrium search (GES) framework. We investigate  performance of the proposed approaches and compare them with the best available solver on well-known benchmarks instances. The reported computational results indicate a high efficiency of the developed algorithm.</br>
