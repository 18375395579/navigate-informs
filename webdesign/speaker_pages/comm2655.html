Title: An Algorithm for Optimization Problems with Stochastic Order Constraints Induced by Linear Recourse<br>Author: Dimitri Drapkin, Faculty of Mathematics, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Forsthausweg 2, 47057 Duisburg, Duisburg, Germany, drapkin@freenet.de<br>Coauthor(s): Ruediger Schultz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We derive a cutting plane decomposition method for stochastic programs with first-order dominance constraints induced by linear recourse models with continuous variables in the second stage. Computational results indicate that our method is favorable over the application of general-purpose mixed-integer linear programming solvers.
