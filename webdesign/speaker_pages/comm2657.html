Title: Optimization for Data Reduction<br>Author: Sigurdur Olafsson, Assistant Professor, Iowa State University, Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States, olafsson@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shuning Wu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Data reduction is critical to most data mining projects. Selecting relevant variables, often referred to as feature or attribute selection, is well known, and in the last few years instance selection has begun to receive more attention. In this talk we discuss attribute and instance selection from an optimization perspective. We show how both problems can be formulated as combinatorial optimization problems and discuss possible solution methods.
