Prior research has shown that there are nice computational properties of the network ATFM model.  With the introduction of fairness constraints, we find that many of these properties are lost.  In order to regain computationally tractability, we develop two techniques that apply not only with fairness considerations, but also to the general network ATFM problem.</br>
