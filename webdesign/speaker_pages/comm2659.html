J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, jpgoncal@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Forrest, Laszlo Ladanyi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Primal heuristics are one important component of branch-and-bound software for Mixed-Integer Linear programming. In this talk, we will review the heuristics available in the COIN-OR branch and cut solver Cbc and we will describe in detail the diving heuristics recently added. Finally, we present computational results that illustrate the performance of those heuristics.</br>
