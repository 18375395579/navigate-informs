Title: Adaptive Value Function Approximation for Continuous-State Stochastic Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Prashant Tarun, Assistant Professor, Craig School of Business, Missouri Western State University, St. Joseph, MO, 64507, United States of America, ptarun@missouriwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Huiyuan Fan, Victoria Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study presents a sequential method of value function approximation in the high-dimensional, continuous-state dynamic programming framework. This method can adaptively determine both sample size and model structure. Furthermore, we introduce two new algorithms that help implement the adaptive value function approximation method efficiently.
