Title: A Multi-level Location-allocation Problem in Human Milk Banking Network Expansion<br>Author: Melih Çelik, Georgia Institue of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, melihcelik@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wenwei Cao, Nadia Viljoen, Julie L. Swann, Ozlem Ergun<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by a project on a human milk bank reserve, we study a large-scale multi-level location-allocation problem for supply chain network expansion. With limited resources, equitable access to breast milk for newborn infants is one of the main concerns. We incorporate several fairness metrics into the model. Under certain metrics, the MIP becomes intractable. We develop efficient heuristics to find good solutions and conduct comparative computational analysis of different fairness metrics.
