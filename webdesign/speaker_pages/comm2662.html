Title: Robust Sparse Regression and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit<br>Author: Yudong Chen, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, ydchen@utexas.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider support recovery in sparse regression, when a subset of the covariate/response pairs is arbitrarily corrupted. All existing tractable methods fail to provide any guarantees. Surprisingly, the natural brute force algorithm is also remarkably poor.  In contrast, we provide a simple algorithm that gives stronger performance guarantees. Moreover, we compare our formulation with robust optimization, and demonstrate interesting connection and difference between them.
