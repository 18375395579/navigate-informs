We propose necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of survivable routing with upper-layer protection, formulate this problem as a mixed-integer program, and design a novel upper-layer spanning tree protection algorithm which guarantees the upper-layer network connectivity and generates routings within lower-layer capacity. Computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.</br>
