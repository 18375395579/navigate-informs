In addition, very weak lower (upper) bounds on the objective function are obtained from the linear relaxation to deterministic equivalent reformulations of SIP-C. We present a new branch-and-cut method for SIP-C with random technology and right-hand side based on irreducible infeasible subsystems (IIS). We report computational results based on standard instances.</br>
