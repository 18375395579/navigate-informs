The task of finding relevant documents can be viewed as a many-dimensional optimization problem, where each concept represents a dimension. In this study we propose a concept-based method for document classification. The procedure models the queries using a value function, which is learnt by solving a sequence of linear problems. The iterative nature of the process ensures that only relevant concepts are retained.</br>
