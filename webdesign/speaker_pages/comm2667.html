A kmCDS is a fault-tolerant connected dominating set (CDS). We give three exponentially-sized IP formulations based on vertex-cuts (depending on whether m  k) and study their integer hulls. Finally, we show that a lazy-constraint approach compares favorably with existing approaches for the minimum CDS problem (the case k = m = 1 in our problem). We present computational results for k = m = 2; 3; 4 as well.</br>
