Title: An Integer Programming Approach for K-connected m-Dominating Sets<br>Author: Austin Buchanan, Texas A&M University, Industrial & Systems Engineering, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, buchanan@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Je Sang Sung, Sergiy Butenko<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the minimum k-connected m-dominating set(kmCDS) problem. A kmCDS is a fault-tolerant connected dominating set (CDS). We give three exponentially-sized IP formulations based on vertex-cuts (depending on whether m  k) and study their integer hulls. Finally, we show that a lazy-constraint approach compares favorably with existing approaches for the minimum CDS problem (the case k = m = 1 in our problem). We present computational results for k = m = 2; 3; 4 as well.
