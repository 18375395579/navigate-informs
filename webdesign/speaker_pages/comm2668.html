Title: Approximating Functions in Logarithmic Space and Time<br>Author: Nir Halman, MIT, 1-176, 77 Mass. Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, halman@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Orlin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider several natural problems related to the design and analysis of approximation algorithms. We define a set of sufficient conditions on a nonnegative integer-valued oracle function f, and on its domain D, so that we can construct good approximations for f in space, time, and number of queries, which are all logarithmic in |D| and max f(x). We develop almost optimal solutions for combinatorial optimization problems on several families of directed acyclic graphs.
