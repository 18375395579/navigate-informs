We consider several cash reservoir models for the firm including  two mean-reverting processes: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and square-root processes. We provide our solution via a new characterization of the value function for one-dimensional diffusions and provide easily implementable algorithms to find the optimal control and the value function.</br>
