Title: Optimal Dividend Payments under Fixed Cost and Implementation Delays for Various Models<br>Author: Erhan Bayraktar, Assistant Professor of Mathematics, University of Michigan, Mathematics Department, 530 Church Street, 1043, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, erhan@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Masahiko Egami<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We solve the dividend optimization problem for a corporation when the managers   are facing (regulatory) implementation delays. We consider several cash reservoir models for the firm including  two mean-reverting processes: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and square-root processes. We provide our solution via a new characterization of the value function for one-dimensional diffusions and provide easily implementable algorithms to find the optimal control and the value function.
