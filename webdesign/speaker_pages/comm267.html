We propose a class of global methods based on Lagrangian duality to solve the problem to optimality. For practical uses when dealing large-scale instances, two decomposition algorithms based on Benders cut and ADMM are investigated. These schemes often generate solutions whose objective values are smaller than the conventional approach and are very close to the optimal points.</br>
