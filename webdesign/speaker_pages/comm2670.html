Title: Optimization Based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) for the Production Routing Problem<br>Author: R Jans, HEC Montréal, 3000 Chemin de la Cote Ste-Catherine, Gol Bureau 5.821, Montreal, QC, H3T 2A7, Canada, raf.jans@hec.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Yossiri Adulyasak, Jean-François Cordeau<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The production-routing problem integrates a multi-level dynamic lot-sizing problem with vehicle routing decisions. We present a heuristic which combines an ALNS on the binary variables with a network optimization approach for the continuous variables. The computational results show that this algorithm is superior to existing approaches on benchmark test instances.
