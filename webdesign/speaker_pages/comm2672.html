Title: A Framework for Implementing Parallel Tree Search Algorithms<br>Author: Yan Xu, Optimization Developer, SAS Institute Inc, yax2@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Saltzman, Ted Ralphs, Laszlo Ladanyi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: COPS is a framework for implementing and parallelizing tree search algorithms. It employs a number of features to improve scalability and support the implementation of data intensive algorithms. Implementing such algorithms in a scalable manner is challenging. We describe the design of COPS and how the design addresses these challenges. We present several applications built with COPS and some computational results of solving integer programs.
