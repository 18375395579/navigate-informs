<br>Title: Pseudo-superadditive lifting</br><br>Author: Jean-Philippe Richard, Associate Professor, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems, Engineering 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, richard@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Amar Narisetty</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: It is well-known that lifting in integer programming can be performed efficiently if the lifting function is superadditive. In particular, it can be shown in that case that the lifting function stays identical as variables are being lifted. We identify a new set of conditions under which lifting can be performed in closed-form although the lifting function might change after variables are lifted. We provide illustrations of the procedure on mixed-integer knapsack set.</br>
