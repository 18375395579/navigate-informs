Title: On the Combination of Lagrangian and Interior Approaches for Stochastic Nonlinear Programs<br>Author: Di Zhang, Dept of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engg, UIUC, 117 Transportation Building, 104 S.

We address precisely an extension, focusing primarily on a Lagrangian approach. Crucial to the implementability of such ideas is the need to introduce decomposability into the primal scenario problems, by using Schur complement ideas in conjunction with a primal-dual approach. Furthermore multiplier updates can be obtained in parallel.
