His Ph.D. thesis, Scheduling of Petroleum Refinery Operations, influenced the oil industry's adoption of linear programming in the 1950s. In 1958 he showed how to approximate notoriously difficult multiproduct dynamic economic-lot-size models with shared capacity by a linear program. In 1960 he introduced an ingenious linear-programming approach to Markov decision chains. We review these works, his professional career and his many honors.</br>
