They provide several benefits over traditional direct dispatching such as shorter tours for drivers. We study the strategic design of RNs considering operational limitations. We present a comprehensive review of different model formulations and solution methods for this problem and suggest a robust optimization approach to capture major sources of uncertainty that exist in practice.</br>
