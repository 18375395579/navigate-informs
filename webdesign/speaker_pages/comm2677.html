<br>Title: QPPAL: A Friendly Solver for Large-Scale QPs</br><br>Author: Sven Leyffer, Computational Mathematician, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S. Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States, leyffer@mcs.anl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Friedlander</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Our new approach for solving quadratic programs (QPs) is based on gradient projection, augmented Lagrangian, and filter methods. Using gradient projection, we approximately minimize the augmented Lagrangian to estimates the optimal active set. This active set estimate is explored further by approximately solving an equality constrained QP. Global convergence is promoted through a filter. Our implementation is based on the  large-scale toolboxes TAO and PETSc.</br>
