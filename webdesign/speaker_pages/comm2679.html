Title: Scheduling Reentrant Jobs<br>Author: Ed Mooney, Associate Professor, Montana State University, M&IE Department, Bozeman, MT, 59717-3800, United States, emooney@ie.montana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Deepu Philip<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Capacitated workstations, multiple routes, sequence dependent setup times, and reentrant jobs make the reentrant flexible job shop with sequence-dependent setups (RFJSSDS) problem one of the most general and difficult shop scheduling problems.   We identify several important properties of RFJSSDS and use them to couple a local search algorithm with a general shop simulator for efficient scheduling. Experiments with a set of synthetic instances demonstrate the value of the approach.
