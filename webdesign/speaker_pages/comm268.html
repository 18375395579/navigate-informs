Title: Adaptive Transit Routing under Uncertainty<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas, Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tarun Rambha, Travis Waller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: An adaptive transit routing (ATR) problem on a stochastic transit network is defined and is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. State space reduction through pre-processing is achieved by solving variants of time dependent shortest paths and applying rules of dominance. Sampling based approximation techniques are used to solve an instance of the problem to demonstrate its application.
