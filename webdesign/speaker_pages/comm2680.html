Title: Hybrid Gradient Search for Optimizing Biopharmaceutical Supply Chain Decision-making<br>Author: Stewart Liu, PhD Student, University of California- Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, MC1777, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, stewart_liu@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Phil Kaminsky<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Motivated by our success in solving stochastic supply chain optimization problems in the biopharmaceutical industry using retrospective optimization, we present a hybrid retrospective optimization-stochastic gradient search algorithm that in initial empirical testing is both fast and effective.   This method uses short time horizon optimization problems as a starting point for stochastic gradient search, and is significantly faster than retrospective optimization approaches.
