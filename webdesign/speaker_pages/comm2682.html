Title: Convex Stochastic  Minimization and Saddle Point Problems via Stochastic Mirror-Prox Algorithm<br>Author: Arkadi Nemirovski, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, nemirovs@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anatoli Juditsky, Claire Tauvel<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a novel Stochastic Mirror-Prox (SMP) algorithm  for Convex Stochastic Nash Equilibrium problems (e.g., problems of convex minimization and of solving  convex-concave games). Assuming the associated monotone operator  possessing both smooth and nonsmooth components, we show that SMP  exhibits optimal rates of convergence achievable under this  hypothesis. We discuss applications of SMP to  Stochastic Composite minimization, Semidefinite feasibility and  Eigenvalue minimization.
