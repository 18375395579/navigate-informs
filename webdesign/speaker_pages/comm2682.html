Assuming the associated monotone operator  possessing both smooth and nonsmooth components, we show that SMP  exhibits optimal rates of convergence achievable under this  hypothesis. We discuss applications of SMP to  Stochastic Composite minimization, Semidefinite feasibility and  Eigenvalue minimization.</br>
