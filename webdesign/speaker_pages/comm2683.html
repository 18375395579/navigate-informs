A primary interest of our work is to illustrate the  superiority of the deterministic shortest-trip-distance-first over the stochastic first-come-first-served when integrated into the design phase. The take-away of this talk is to design the loop and stations under shortest-trip-distance-first, and operate the  fleet of the vehicles under first-encountered-first-served dispatching.</br>
