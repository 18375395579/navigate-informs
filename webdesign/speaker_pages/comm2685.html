<br>Title: Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree: A Hybrid Approach using Linear Programming Relaxations</br><br>Author: Louis-Martin Rousseau, CIRRELT - Polytechnique Montréal, CP 6079 Succ Centre-Ville, Montréal, Se, H3C 3A7, Canada, louis-martin.rousseau@cirrelt.net</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xavier Lorca, Jean-Guillaume Fages</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a Constraint Programming approach for solving the Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem. It is based on relaxations techniques stemming from Operations Research, such as Lagrangian and Linear relaxations. The contribution of this paper is a fine integration of these techniques within a Constraint Programming framework. The experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art dedicated method of Salles Da Cunha and Lucena on a class of instances.</br>
