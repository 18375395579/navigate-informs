Title: Branch-and-cut for the Robust Single-machine Scheduling<br>Author: Ismael de Farias, Associate Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering, Texas Tech, Lubbock, TX, United States of America, defarias@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christy Zhao, Ming Zhao<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a family of facet-defining inequalities for the robust single-machine scheduling polyhedron, in which the processing times of the jobs are uncertain. We give computational results that demonstrate the efficiency of the inequalities when used as cuts in a branch-and-cut algorithm.
