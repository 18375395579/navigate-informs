<br>Title: A Polynomial Time Algorithm for the Stochastic Uncapacitated Lot-Sizing Problem</br><br>Author: Yongpei Guan, Assistant Professor, The University of Oklahoma, 202 West Boyd Street, Room 124, Norman, OK, 73019, United States, Yongpei.Guan-1@ou.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Miller</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a path property of an optimal solution for the stochastic uncapacitated lot-sizing problem (SULS) and develop a backward recursion that shows the value function is piecewise linear and right-continuous. We use these properties to derive a polynomial time algorithm for the problem. Then, we show that the value function for the SULS problem without set-up cost is continuous, piecewise linear and convex and therefore, a more efficient algorithm is developed for this special case.</br>
