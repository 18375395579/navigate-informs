Title: The Gradient Oriented Multi-objective Simulation Optimization Search Algorithm<br>Author: Loo Hay Lee, Associate Professor, National University of Singapore, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore, 119260, Singapore, iseleelh@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Ek Peng Chew, Haobin Li<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: With dominated hyper-volume serving as the search improvement indicator, this research work incorporates gradient information of a multi-objective optimization problem into a generalized stochastic search framework, aiming to achieve high efficiency without losing necessary exploration of the search space. It is designed as a transferrable approach that every search algorithm conforms to the framework can apply. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the method proposed.
