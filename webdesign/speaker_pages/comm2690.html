Algorithms such as the stochastic dual dynamic programming  method (SDDP) require the forecasting model to be linear in order to maintain convexity in the future cost function. This limits the type of  forecasting models and thus mostly simple methods such as linear autoregressive models are used in practice. We discuss these approaches  and compare them to more advanced methods.</br>
