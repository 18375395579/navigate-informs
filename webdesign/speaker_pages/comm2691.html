Title: A Robust One-phase Scheduling Method for the RCPSP with Stochastic Activity Durations<br>Author: Patricio Lamas, KU Leuven, Naamsestraat 69 - box 3555, Leuven, 3000, Belgium, Patricio.LamasVilches@kuleuven.be<br>Coauthor(s): Erik Demeulemeester<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The RCPSP with stochastic activity durations involves the determination of a proactive schedule. Traditional robust methods are two-phases: first they fix the resource network and secondly they make the schedule robust. We propose a one-phase method that minimizes the project makespan s.t. a risk level. Results show that there exists a clear relation between risk and the two classical measures (solution and quality robustness). We compare our approach with two published methods.
