The first step is to make a trade-off between cheaper rosters that require higher skilled workers and the training costs to obtain this higher skilled workforce. The second step is to design an optimal training schedule to obtain the optimal skill mix with minimal costs. We illustrate our models with a computational experiment based on real life data.</br>
