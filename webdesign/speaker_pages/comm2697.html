Title: Estimating the Operating Cost at Pumped-Storage Plants with Stochastic Optimization<br>Author: Goran Vojvodic, PhD student, George Washington University, 2201 G St NW, Funger Hall 415, Washington, DC, 20037, United States of America, goranv@gwu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A precise estimation of the operating cost for pumped-storage power plants is needed. A novel approach is presented based on a structural parallel between two-settlement energy markets and the two-stage stochastic optimization modeling paradigm in order to estimate the operating cost at a plant. The results differ from the deterministic approach and we believe they are more accurate because they were obtained using an approach that is structurally similar to the operation of energy markets.
