A novel approach is presented based on a structural parallel between two-settlement energy markets and the two-stage stochastic optimization modeling paradigm in order to estimate the operating cost at a plant. The results differ from the deterministic approach and we believe they are more accurate because they were obtained using an approach that is structurally similar to the operation of energy markets.</br>
