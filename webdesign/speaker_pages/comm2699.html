Title: An Analysis of Network Structures for the Robust Vehicle Routing Problem<br>Author: Ilgaz Sungur, PhD Candidate, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, sungur@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fernando Ordonez, Maged Dessouky<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We apply robust optimization methodology on the Vehicle Routing Problem to address the uncertainty in demand and cost. We develop robust counterparts and use performance measures to compare the robust and deterministic solutions. We experimentally analyze demand uncertainty using an open source solver. Our results on both literature and random instances show that for certain network structures, robust solution benefits from strategic allocation of the slack in vehicles with little extra cost.
