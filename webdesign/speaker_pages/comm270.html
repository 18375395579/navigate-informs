Title: Heuristics for Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming<br>Author: Kumar Abhishek, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, kua3@lehigh.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present extensions of well-known primal heuristics for mixed  integer linear programming such as feasibility pump, local branching  and RINS, to mixed integer nonlinear programs. The heuristics have  been implemented within FilMINT, a branch-and-cut solver for MINLPs.  Results of detailed computational experiments will be presented.
