Title: First Prize: A Decision Support Framework for Rolling Stock Rescheduling<br>Author: Lars Nielsen, PhD Student, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam School of Management, PO Box 1738, Rotterdam, ZH, 3000DR, Netherlands, lnielsen@rsm.nl<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a generic framework for modeling disruptions in railway rolling stock schedules. A disruption is modeled as an online rolling stock rescheduling problem where information on resource availability becomes available as the situation evolves. We propose a rolling horizon approach   to decompose the problem and extend an existing model for generic rolling stock scheduling to the real time case. We perform computational tests on instances constructed from real life cases and discuss their implications.
