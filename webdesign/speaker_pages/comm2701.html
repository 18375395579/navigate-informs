Title: DECOMP: A Framework for Decomposition in Integer Programming<br>Author: Matthew Galati, Optimization Interface Lead, SAS Institute, 100 SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC, 27513-2414, United States, Matthew.Galati@sas.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Decomposition techniques such as Lagrangian Relaxation and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition are well-known methods of developing bounds for discrete optimization problems. We draw connections between these classical approaches and techniques based on dynamic cut generation. We discuss methods for integrating cut generation and decomposition in a number of different contexts and present DECOMP, an open-source framework that provides a uniform interface for implementation of these various techniques.
