Title: FilMINT: A Linearizations-Based Solver for Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programs<br>Author: Kumar Abhishek, Graduate Student, Lehigh University, Mohler Lab, 200 W. Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, kua3@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sven Leyffer, Jeff Linderoth<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe a solver for mixed integer nonlinear programs that implements a linearization-based algorithm in a branch-and-cut framework. We use the advanced features of an existing MILP framework and show how to use it to add and manage the linearizations. The solver uses MINTO for solving the MILP, and Filter-SQP, an active set  solver, for solving the nonlinear programs. Detailed computational experiments are presented, highlighting the framework's effectiveness.
