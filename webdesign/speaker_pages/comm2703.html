<br>Title: A Homogeneous Algorithm for Monotone Complementarity Problems Over Symmetric Cones</br><br>Author: Akiko Yoshise, Associate Professor, Univ. Tsukuba, Graduate School of Systems & Information, Univ. Tsukuba, Tsukuba, 305, Japan, yoshise@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: For monotone conic CPs, a homogeneous model has been proposed where a bounded path having a trivial starting point exists, any accumulation point of the path is a solution of the model, if the problem is solvable then it gives us a solution, if the o problem is strongly infeasible, then it gives us a certificate proving infeasibility. We propose a class of algorithms for tracing the path above. For linear problems, polynomial iteration complexity bounds of the algorithms are derived.</br>
