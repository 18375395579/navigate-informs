Traditional SLP with dynamic programming (DP) is not solvable for most realistic networks because of the large dimensionality of the state space (e.g., typical numbers for even a modest-sized hotel with hundreds of thousands products and for each product DP will go along each of stages =  180-500,  each unit of capacities = 500-3000, each of time slots = 500 ?10000, leading to at least 10100 states).  Moreover, DP cannot directly deal with constraints, such as upgradings(UP) and overbookings (OB). We will develop a stochastic model which is solvable together with RU and GB. We accomplish solving it in real time by suggesting a heuristic that generates a good initial feasible solution.</br>
