Title: A Novel Hybrid Vehicle Routing Approach for PCB Assembly on a Collect-and-place Machine<br>Author: Diego Klabjan, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, Ind. Eng. and Mgmt. Sci., d-klabjan@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anupam Seth, Placid Ferreira<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Effective production planning on the collect-and-place assembly machine defies standard OR approaches, resulting in unexploited automation flexibility. We model the problem as a generalized vehicle routing problem and present a constructive heuristic with a worst-case bound. An improvement integer programming based heuristic is also designed.
