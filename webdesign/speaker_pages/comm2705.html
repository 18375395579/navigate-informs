Eng. and Mgmt. Sci., d-klabjan@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anupam Seth, Placid Ferreira</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Effective production planning on the collect-and-place assembly machine defies standard OR approaches, resulting in unexploited automation flexibility. We model the problem as a generalized vehicle routing problem and present a constructive heuristic with a worst-case bound. An improvement integer programming based heuristic is also designed.</br>
