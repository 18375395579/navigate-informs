Title: n-step Mingling Inequalities<br>Author: Kiavash Kianfar, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, 239B Zachry, TAMU 3131, College Station, TX, 77843-3131, United States of America, kianfar@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alper Atamturk<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Mingling and two-step mingling inequalities are inequalities based on mixed integer rounding (MIR) which were recently shown to be valid (and in many cases facet-defining) for mixed-integer knapsack sets with bounded variables. We show that in general mingling and n-step MIR ideas can be utilized together to generate new classes of valid inequalities called n-step mingling inequalities.
