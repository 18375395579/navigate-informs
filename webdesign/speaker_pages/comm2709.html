Title: A Cutting Surface Method for Linear Programs with Linear Stochastic Dominance Constraints<br>Author: Sanjay Mehrotra, Northwestern University, IEMS Department, MEAS, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, mehrotra@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tito Homem-de-Mello<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study linear optimization problems with multi-dimensional linear-positive-second-order-stochastic-dominance constraints. By using the polyhedral properties of the second-order-linear dominance condition we present a cutting-surface algorithm, and show its finite convergence.  We present a novel branch-and-cut algorithm for finding the cut by combining ideas from concave minimization with those from binary integer programming.
