Title: Simultaneous Lifting in Knapsack Polytopes<br>Author: Todd Easton, Associate Professor, Kansas State University, 2021 Durland Hall, Manhattan, KS, 66506, United States of America, teaston@ksu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kamana Sharma, Jessica Heier<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The binary knapsack has been one of the most widely studied polytopes. This talk describes a new technique to generate numerous exact simultaneously lifted cover inequalities in quadratic time. Conditions when these inequalities are facet-defining are also presented along with some computational results.
