Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the flexible demand management problem with stochastic prices and demand arrivals. Decisions are made recursively over a certain number of periods. We first analyze the stochastic multi-objective optimization problem where the objectives are to minimize the expected total cost and discomfort. Then, we formulate and solve a distributional-robust optimization model. We show that decision makers will be potentially better off if confronted with stochastic prices.</br>
