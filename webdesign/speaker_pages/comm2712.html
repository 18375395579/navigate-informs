Title: Enumerating Solutions for an NP-hard Scheduling Problem Using Condor<br>Author: Mark McElreath, Clemson University, 110 Freeman Hall, Dept. of Industrial Engineering, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States, mmcelre@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mary Beth Kurz, William Ferrell, Priyantha Devapriya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider the fleet sizing problem of a vendor who produces/distributes a perishable product. The integrated analysis of production-distribution scheduling of this problem is NP-hard; a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to find a near optimal solution. Without lower bounds or a feasible MIP for a moderate size problem, we use Condor, a high throughput computing solution, to enumerate all solutions for a moderate size problem and provide a basis for evaluating the performance of the GA.
