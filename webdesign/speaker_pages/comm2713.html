Title: Modeling Proton Beam Allocation at a Cancer Treatment Center<br>Author: Min Wang, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, mwang13@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chris P. Lee, Sergei Savin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Proton cancer therapy has a high facility cost requiring a high utilization to maintain profitability. We consider the problem of allocating and switching proton beam time among multiple treatment rooms to maximize throughput at a large proton center. We develop a deterministic version of the problem as a mixed integer programming model and a heuristic algorithm for solving it. For the stochastic version, we incorporate uncertainty in patient arrivals and the duration of patient prepping.
