<br>Title: Network Routing under Active Congestion Control: Theory and Practice</br><br>Author: Stanko Dimitrov, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, sdimitro@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dushyant Sharma, Marina Epelman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present formulations of network routing models that incorporate active congestion control and show each is NP-Hard.  We next present iterative methods for solving these models and show that the resulting routing policies outperform the current routing policies in the backbone network of the Internet2 community.   To conclude we generate a robust routing policy to handle network demand fluctuations.</br>
