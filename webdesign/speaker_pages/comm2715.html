For the latter problem, a classical theorem states  that the chromatic number of a graph is bounded from above by the number of vertices in the longest elementary   path in any directed graph derived by orienting all edges in the graph. We generalize this result to the  bandwidth   coloring problem by deriving a series of equivalent   mathematical programming models.
