Title: The COIN-OR Open Solver Interface: Inside a Portable Solver API<br>Author: Matt Saltzman, Clemson University, Mathematical Sciences Department, Clemson, SC, 29631, United States, mjs@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laszlo Ladanyi, Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The Open Solver Interface of the COIN-OR toolkit implements a set of C++ classes for model instance construction and modification, solver invocation, and solution extraction.  The OSI provides a common API architecture for any supported solver and is easily extensible to other solvers.  We describe the OSI architecture and several examples of its application and we discus issues relating to extending the OSI to more general classes of problems and solvers.
