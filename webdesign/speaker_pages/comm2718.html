Title: Two-stage Robust Optimization for N-k Contingency-constrained Unit Commitment<br>Author: Qianfan Wang, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, qfwang@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Paul Watson, Yongpei Guan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A two-stage robust optimization approach is presented to solve the general N-k contingency-constrained unit commitment (CCUC) problem. Both generator and transmission line contingencies are considered in this research. We propose a decomposition framework to enable tractable computation. In our algorithm, the master problem makes unit commitment decisions and the subproblem inspects the worst-case contingency scenarios. The computational results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
