Both generator and transmission line contingencies are considered in this research. We propose a decomposition framework to enable tractable computation. In our algorithm, the master problem makes unit commitment decisions and the subproblem inspects the worst-case contingency scenarios. The computational results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</br>
