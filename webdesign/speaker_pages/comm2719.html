Gay, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 0370, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-0370, United States, dmgay@sandia.gov</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The AMPL/Solver Interface Library (ASL) is perhaps the first general, open-source interface library for linear, mixed-integer, and nonlinear programming.  It offers sparse or dense first and second derivatives and, for linear constraints, makes the commonly used column-oriented constraint matrix representation readily available.  It also conveys names, complementarity conditions and some logical constraints, and is evolving to provide more constructs for constraint and stochastic programming.</br>
