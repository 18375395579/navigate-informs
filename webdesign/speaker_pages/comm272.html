Title: Using Incompatibilities to Reduce Search Space for Selective and Dynamic VRPs<br>Author: Aziz Moukrim, Universit?de Technologies de Compiègne - CNRS UMR 6599 Heudiasyc, Centre de Recherches de Royallieu, Compiègne, Fr, 60205, France, aziz.moukrim@utc.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Hermann Bouly<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a solution method for a specific selective vehicle routing problem for a real life application. An Iterative Destruction/Construction Heuristic is used for solution's improvement. Some pre-processing methods reduce the search space. These methods are based on the use of concepts like incompatibilities and required customers. These concepts help finding better solutions and are usefull for dynamic VRPs.
