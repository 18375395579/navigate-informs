A new method for modeling the non-overlapping constraints is discussed. To consider the optimal assignment of some objects to a set of rectangular plates, we propose a decomposition algorithm which can be generalized to a special class of non-convex MINLP problem. If the assignment decisions are decoupled from the remaining constraints of the optimization problem, we propose a column enumeration approach.</br>
