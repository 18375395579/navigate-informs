Title: Packing Circles and Polygons into Rectangles<br>Author: Steffen Rebennack, Ph.D Student, University of Florida, Center of Applied Optimization, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, steffen@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Pardalos, Josef Kallrath<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a packing of circles and polygons into an area minimizing rectangular plate. A new method for modeling the non-overlapping constraints is discussed. To consider the optimal assignment of some objects to a set of rectangular plates, we propose a decomposition algorithm which can be generalized to a special class of non-convex MINLP problem. If the assignment decisions are decoupled from the remaining constraints of the optimization problem, we propose a column enumeration approach.
