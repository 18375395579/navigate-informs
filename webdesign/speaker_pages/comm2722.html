Title: An Analytical 3-Dimensional Bin-Packing Model<br>Author: Yupo Chan, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, 2801 S University, Little Rock, AR, 72204, United States of America, yxchan@ualr.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ghulam Rasool, James Moore, Gregory Taylor, Richard Cronk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An analytical model is offered to the 3-dimensional bin-packing problem. The model yields Pareto optima, rather than a single optimum. To speed up the solution algorithm, all available boxes to be packed were first sorted in a non-decreasing fashion according to their height and later packed layer-by-layer. Relaxation of the model is shown to be the linear-programming bound advanced by Federgruen and Van Ryzin for heuristic solution.
