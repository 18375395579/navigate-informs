Title: Shaping Demand in Supply Chains with Configurable Products<br>Author: Markus Ettl, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, msettl@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Karthik Sourirajan, Feng Cheng, Pu Huang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe a methodology for effectively balancing supply and demand through an integrated use of demand flexibility and stochastic inventory planning. Demand flexibility is modeled by firm-driven product substitution where the firm recognizes customer buying preferences. We formulate a nonlinear optimization model and show how to exploit the structural properties of the model to develop an efficient solution procedure, utilizing sub-gradient derivative methods and integer programming techniques.
