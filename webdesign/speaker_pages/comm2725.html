Title: A Very Large Scale Search Algorithm for General Balancing Problems<br>Author: Bob Storer, Professor, ISE Department, Mohler Lab 200, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, rhs2@lehigh.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We discuss a Very Large Scale Neighborhood search algorithm for solving a generalized balancing problem. At each iteration an extension of the number partitioning problem is solved. This work extends a previous, quite successful algorithm for the rotor blade balancing problem.
