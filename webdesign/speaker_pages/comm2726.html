<br>Title: Polyhedral Aspects of Nonconvex, Lower Semicontinuous Piecewise Linear Optimization</br><br>Author: Juan Pablo Vielma, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States, jvielma@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George L. Nemhauser, Ahmet  B. Keha</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a SOS2 based branch-and-cut algorithm for solving linear problems with nonconvex lower semi-continuous separable piecewise linear cost functions. We show how valid inequalities (cuts) previously introduced by Keha et. al. for the continuous case can be extended to the lower semi-continuous case. We then introduce a simple generalization of one of these cuts and two new cuts for fixed charge jumps. Finally, we present computational results showing the effectiveness of these cuts.</br>
