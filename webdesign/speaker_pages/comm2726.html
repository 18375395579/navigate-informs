Nemhauser, Ahmet  B. Keha<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a SOS2 based branch-and-cut algorithm for solving linear problems with nonconvex lower semi-continuous separable piecewise linear cost functions. We show how valid inequalities (cuts) previously introduced by Keha et. al. for the continuous case can be extended to the lower semi-continuous case. We then introduce a simple generalization of one of these cuts and two new cuts for fixed charge jumps. Finally, we present computational results showing the effectiveness of these cuts.
