Title: Solving Mixed-Integer Semidefinite Programs<br>Author: Lars Schewe, Dr., FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, Cauerstr. 11, Erlangen, 91058, Germany, lars.schewe@math.uni-erlangen.de<br>Coauthor(s): Sonja Mars<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present practical solution approaches to solve mixed-integer semidefinite programs: We show that by integrating standard semidefinite solvers into the mixed-integer solver SCIP, we can harness standard methods from integer programming. We present computational results on a variety of instances.
