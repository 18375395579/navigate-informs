Title: Closedness of Mixed Integer Hulls of Second Order Conic Programming Problems<br>Author: Diego Moran, Georgia Tech, 755 Ferst Drive NW, Room 422, Main building, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, dmoran@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Santanu Dey<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Given rational matrices $A$, $B$ and vector $b$, we show that there exists a polynomial time algorithm to check the closedness of the convex hull of the set $\{(x,y)|Ax +By -b \in L, x integral\}$, where $L$ is the Lorentz cone. Moreover, in the special case of pure integer problems, we present sufficient conditions for verifying the closedness of the integer hull of the feasible region of a more general second order conic programming problem (SOCP) that can also be checked in polynomial time.
