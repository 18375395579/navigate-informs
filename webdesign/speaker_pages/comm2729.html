Title: Solution Methods for Pre-positioning of Emergency Supplies Under Uncertainty<br>Author: Mark Turnquist, Cornell University, mat14@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Carmen Rawls<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe two solution algorithms for a two-stage stochastic optimization model that determines locations and quantities of emergency supplies to be pre-positioned in anticipation of potential natural disasters ?an exact method based on the L-shaped method for integer stochastic programs and a heuristic based on an approximation method for the second-stage objective function. The solution quality and computational effort are compared in a case study based on the southeastern U.S.
