Title: Busy-Periods of Discrete-Queues and the Lagrange Implicit Function Theorem<br>Author: Geoffrey Brown, Royal Military College, Geoffrey.Brown@rmc.ca<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We solve the Busy-Period distribution explicitly for several discrete-time queueing models. The results are obtained using the coefficient operator version of the Lagrange Theorem. The coefficient operator notation also leads to an efficient algorithm for obtaining probabilities from the Lagrangian distributions.
