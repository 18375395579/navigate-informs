Title: Local Graph Algorithms for Clustering<br>Author: Reid Andersen, Postdoctoral Researcher, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052, United States of America, reidan@microsoft.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Local graph clustering algorithms find clusters of related vertices while examining only small local neighborhoods of the input graph.  This talk is a survey of recently developed algorithms and techniques for local graph clustering, including local algorithms for the sparsest cut problem based on truncated random walks, personalized PageRank, and the 'evolving set' process.
