Title: The Max K-Armed Bandit Problem: Mediating the Use of Multiple Search Heuristics<br>Author: Stephen Smith, Research Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, The Robotics Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, sfs@cs.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Randomization has been shown to be an effective means of boosting the performance of search heuristics in combinatorial domains, yet it is often the case that the utility of a given heuristic varies across problem instances. In this talk we consider the problem of allocating trials among a set of heuristics to best exploit their differential power, which we formalize as the Max k-armed bandit problem. We summarize recent theoretical results and show their application to scheduling problems.
