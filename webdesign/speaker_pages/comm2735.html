Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming for Routing Problems<br>Author: Sandjai Bhulai, VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Sciences, De Boelelaan 1081a, Amsterdam, 1081 HV, Netherlands, sbhulai@few.vu.nl<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study routing problems for general network topologies. For many practical cases this leads to high-dimensional state spaces making many standard solution algorithms numerically intractable. We provide a unifying approach based on approximate dynamic programming to obtain nearly optimal policies. Extensive numerical experiments, for a variety a network topologies, show that the policies have very good performance.
