For many practical cases this leads to high-dimensional state spaces making many standard solution algorithms numerically intractable. We provide a unifying approach based on approximate dynamic programming to obtain nearly optimal policies. Extensive numerical experiments, for a variety a network topologies, show that the policies have very good performance.</br>
