Title: Approximate Stochastic Dynamic Programming for Resource Management with Partial Observations<br>Author: Edwin Chong, Professor, Colorado State University, 1373 Campus Delivery, Fort Collins, CO, 80523-1373, United States of America, Edwin.Chong@colostate.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recent progress in approximation methods for solving partially  observable Markov decision problems has encouraged the formulation and  solution of a wide variety of resource management problems using this  optimization framework. In this talk, we describe methods based on  Bellman's dynamic programming principle and approximations of the  cost-to-go. We focus on Monte Carlo sampling methods. We also show  several recent examples involving sensor resource management problems.
