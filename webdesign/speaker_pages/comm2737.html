<br>Title: Is Stochastic Runway Scheduling Computationally Implementable in Practice?</br><br>Author: Senay Solak, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, solak@isenberg.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gustaf Solveling, John-Paul Clarke, Ellis Johnson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic version of the runway scheduling problem, and analyze it by developing alternative formulations and solution approaches. The results from the computational tests on realistic data sets indicate that practically implementable truncated versions of the proposed solution methods almost always produce high quality solutions.</br>
