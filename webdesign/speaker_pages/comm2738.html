MacGregor Smith, Professor, Dept. of Mechanical and Indust, 160 Givenors Drive, Amherst, Ma, 01003, United States of America, jmsmith@ecs.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ryan Barnes</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Topological network design of closed finite queueing networks with finite buffers is an important part of the design and analysis of manufacturing and service systems. An effective queue decomposition methodology coupled with a nonlinear mixed integer optimization algorithm is employed to allocate servers to series, merge, and split configurations of closed network topologies.</br>
