Title: Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms for Rich Vehicle Routing Problems<br>Author: Andreas Reinholz, Chair of Systems Analysis, Department of Computer Science, University Dortmund, Schmelzer Weg, 8, Troisdorf, 53844, Germany, andreas.reinholz@gmx.de<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a methodology for designing Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms for hierarchical nested Rich Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP). Problem specific neighborhood generating operators, working on different levels of the problem hierarchy, using problem special coding schemes, efficient data structures and accelerated function evaluations are introduced to develop competitive solvers. Experimental results with 101 new best solutions are given for benchmarks of several VRP.
