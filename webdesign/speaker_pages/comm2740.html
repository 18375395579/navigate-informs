<br>Title: Locally-Biased Efficient Global Optimization for Black-Box Optimization using Kriging Surrogates</br><br>Author: Rommel Regis, Assistant Professor, Saint Joseph's University, Department of Mathematics, 5600 City Avenue, Philadelphia, PA, 19131, United States of America, rregis@sju.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm by Jones et al. (1998) is a popular surrogate-based method that works well on many problems. However, its performance on high-dimensional problems and low-dimensional problems with deep and narrow basins tends to be relatively poor. This talk presents locally-biased forms of EGO that address this issue and that yield dramatic improvements over EGO on a 14-D watershed model calibration problem and on several test problems with up to 30 dimensions.</br>
