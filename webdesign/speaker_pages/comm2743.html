Title: Near-optimal Online Algorithms for Dynamic Resource Allocations<br>Author: Xin Lu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, luxin@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Jaillet<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper, we study a general online linear programming problem whose formulation encompasses many dynamic resource allocation problems. We propose a stochastic model, which under mild assumptions, allow near-optimal learning-based online algorithms without prior knowledge on the total number of requests to come, a first of its kind.
