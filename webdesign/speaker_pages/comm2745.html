<br>Title: Modeling Multiple Outputs and Joint Production in Stochastic Semi-nonparametric Envelopment of Data</br><br>Author: Timo Kuosmanen, Professor, Aalto University School of Business, Helsinki, Finland, timo.kuosmanen@aalto.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Johnson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic semi-nonparametric envelopment of data (StoNED) is a new frontier estimation method that combines an axiomatic DEA-style piece-wise linear frontier with probabilistic SFA-style treatment of inefficiency and noise. This paper employs directional distance functions to extend the StoNED method to the general multiple input multiple output settings. We apply the multi-output StoNED method to efficiency assessment of electricity distribution networks in Finland.</br>
