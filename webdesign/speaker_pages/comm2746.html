Title: Multistage-PRIM for Optimization of Multistage Manufacturing Processes with Insufficient Data<br>Author: Doh-Soon Kwak, Division of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea, dskwak@postech.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Kwang-Jae Kim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a new method to optimize a multistage manufacturing process. The proposed method is based on a data mining technique, called Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM). The issues associated with insufficiency of the observational data, which is often encountered in electronics industry, are also discussed. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using a case from a semiconductor manufacturing process.
