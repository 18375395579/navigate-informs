The proposed method is based on a data mining technique, called Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM). The issues associated with insufficiency of the observational data, which is often encountered in electronics industry, are also discussed. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using a case from a semiconductor manufacturing process.</br>
