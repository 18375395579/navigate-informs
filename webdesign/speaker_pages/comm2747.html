Title: Optimal Location of Railroad Wayside Defect Detection Installations<br>Author: Yanfeng Ouyang, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N. Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, yfouyang@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yung-Cheng Lai, Christopher Barkan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper presents network optimization models that select cost-effective installation sites for wayside defect detection systems over a rail network. These systems monitor the mechanical health and performance of railcars and can help prevent derailments. We develop efficient solution techniques to solve the problems and present case studies with empirical data.
