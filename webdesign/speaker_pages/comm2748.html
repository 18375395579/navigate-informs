<br>Title: The Design and Implementation of BLIS</br><br>Author: Yan Xu, Optimization Developer, SAS Institute Inc, yax2@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laszlo Ladanyi, Ted Ralphs, Matthew Saltzman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: BLIS is one the libraried in COPS, which is a framework for implementing parallel algorithms based on tree search. BLIS is the layer for solving mixed-integer linear programs (MIPs) in parallel or sequential. We will give an overveiw of design and implementation BLIS and also present some computational results of solving MIPs and the vehicle routing problem.</br>
