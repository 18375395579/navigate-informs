We present a framework for the tractable verification of solvability in stochastic regimes ; importantly, this avenue does not necessitate the evaluation of an expectation or its derivatives. Extensions to nonsmooth regimes, stochastic quasi-variational inequalities and stochastic complementarity problems  are also presented. The ideas are  illustrated with practical examples Nash-Cournot games.</br>
