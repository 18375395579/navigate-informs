Title: Solvability of Stochastic Variational Inequalities<br>Author: Uma Ravat, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 406 Transportation Building, Urbana, IL, United States of America, ravat1@Illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The analysis of the variational conditions in stochastic regimes is challenging. We present a framework for the tractable verification of solvability in stochastic regimes ; importantly, this avenue does not necessitate the evaluation of an expectation or its derivatives. Extensions to nonsmooth regimes, stochastic quasi-variational inequalities and stochastic complementarity problems  are also presented. The ideas are  illustrated with practical examples Nash-Cournot games.
