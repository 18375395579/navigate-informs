We formulate the problem of optimizing prices for an indivisible good sold to consumers that are embedded in a social network. We derive an LP based procedure to efficiently solve the case of uniform and discriminative prices. We also propose a model where the retailer designs incentives to guarantee the influence of the buyers on neighbors and provide insights with computational examples.</br>
