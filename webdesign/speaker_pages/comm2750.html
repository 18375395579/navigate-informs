Title: An Inexact Primal-Dual Path Following Algorithm for Convex Quadratic SDP<br>Author: Kim-Chuan Toh, Associate Professor, National University of Singapore, Department of Mathematics, 2 Science Drive 2, Singapore, 117543, Singapore, mattohkc@nus.edu.sg<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose interior-point (IP) methods for linearly constrained convex quadratic semidefinite programming. At each IP iteration, the search direction is computed from an  m+n(n+1)/2 dense augmented system, which only be solved by iterative methods when n > 100.  We propose three classes of preconditioners for the augmented matrix. The preconditioned matrices have favorable asymptotic spectra under suitable assumptions. Numerical results show that our methods are efficient and robust.
