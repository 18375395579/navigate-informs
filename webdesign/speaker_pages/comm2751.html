Title: An Route Improvement Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time-dependent Travel Times<br>Author: Miguel Figliozzi, Assistant Professor, Portland State University, figliozzi@pdx.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A new algorithm to solve the Vehicle Routing Problems with Time-Dependent travel times is presented. The solution quality and computational time of the new algorithm is compared against existing results. The algorithm has a strong performance in terms of solution quality and computational time even in instances with a large number of customers.
