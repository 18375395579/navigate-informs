<br>Title: Fairness and Efficiency in Multiportfolio Optimization</br><br>Author: Nikos Trichakis, Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States of America, ntrichakis@hbs.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Iancu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: When a manager is in charge of multiple accounts, the performance of each account depends on the strategies of others due to market impact. We propose a novel approach for jointly optimizing the trading activities of all accounts and also splitting the associated market impact costs. Our approach allows one to balance the conflicting objectives of maximizing aggregate gains and distributing them fairly. We perform numerical studies that suggest that our approach outperforms existing methods.</br>
