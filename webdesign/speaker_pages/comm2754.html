<br>Title: A Multi-stage Stochastic Programming Model for Revenue Management: Nested Controls and Buy-ups</br><br>Author: Burak Buke, PhD Candidate, The University of Texas at Austin, OR/IE Program, 1 University Station C2200, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, bukeb@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): H. Ahmet Kuyumcu, Utku Yildirim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this work, we consider the network capacity control problem of an airline. We propose a multi-stage stochastic programming formulation addressing two important issues: (1) Modeling of nested controls when customers arrive according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, (2) Modeling of buy-up behavior for customers. We discuss the possible solution methodologies and demonstrate our results via numerical examples.</br>
