<br>Title: On Solving Specially Structured Large SDP’s Using IPMs</br><br>Author: Bharath Rangarajan, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street, ME205, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, bharathr@me.umn.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The stability conditions for spatially-distributed control systems give rise to large semidefinite programs with specific structure. The standard gradient techniques are usually employed base on the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. We explore related smooth counterparts that can be solved using interior-point techniques which promise a faster asymptotic convergence as well as an improvement in global convergence.</br>
