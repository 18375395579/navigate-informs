Title: A Greedy Algorithm for Assortment Optimization in the Two-Level Nested Logit Model<br>Author: Guang Li, USC, Marshall School of Business, Los Angeles, United States of America, guang.li.2016@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paat Rusmevichientong<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the assortment optimization problem under the classical two-level nested logit model. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal assortment, and use this optimality condition to develop a simple greedy algorithm that iteratively removes at most one product from each nest, until the optimality condition is satisfied.
