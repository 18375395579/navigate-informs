<br>Title: Nonlinear Approximate Dynamic Programming for Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Dan Adelman, Professor of Operations Management, University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60422, United States of America, dan.adelman@chicagogsb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Canan Uckun</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: For a revenue management problem, we explore a strong functional form to approximate the optimal dynamic programming value function. Whereas most of the ADP literature employs weighted combinations of non-parametric basis functions, our basis functions are nonlinearly parameterized. We provide a solution methodology to solve the resulting non-linear program.</br>
