Title: Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization<br>Author: Juan Arrieta, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, jarrieta@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lorenz Biegler<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The optimal thrusting sequence that will transfer a spacecraft between two points in the Solar System can be obtained from the solution to a large, nonconvex optimal control problem. The NLP resulting from direct transcription is solved with IPOPT. We present realistic examples: an orbit transfer and an Earth-Moon trajectory.
