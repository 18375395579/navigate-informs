Title: A Message-passing Paradigm for Decentralized Control and Optimization<br>Author: Ciamac Moallemi, Stanford University, Electrical Engineering, Packard 274, Stanford, CA, 94305-9510, United States, ciamac@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Van Roy<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a message-passing paradigm for decentralized resource  allocation problems. This is a conceptual framework that generalizes  price-based systems. We demonstrate that this is equivalent to  approaches based on shadow prices when the utility functions are  concave. However, the message-passing approach also extends to more  general cases, and yields an incentive-based framework with certain  optimality guarantees even when utilities are not concave or resources  are indivisible.
