This is a conceptual framework that generalizes  price-based systems. We demonstrate that this is equivalent to  approaches based on shadow prices when the utility functions are  concave. However, the message-passing approach also extends to more  general cases, and yields an incentive-based framework with certain  optimality guarantees even when utilities are not concave or resources  are indivisible.</br>
