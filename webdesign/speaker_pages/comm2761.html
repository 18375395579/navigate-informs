Title: The Circuit Polytope<br>Author: John Hooker, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, john@hooker.tepper.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Latife Genc Kaya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The circuit constraint is useful for the formulation of sequencing problems in constraint programming models.  We analyze the circuit polytope as an alternative to the traveling salesman polytope as a means of obtaining a linear relaxation, which can be used in conjunction with filtering algorithms.  Proper choice of the relaxation allows one to exploit structure in the objective function.
