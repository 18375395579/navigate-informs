<br>Title: A Hybrid Method for Simulation Factor Screening</br><br>Author: Hong Wan, Assistant Professor, School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, hwan@purdue.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Controlled Sequential Bifurcation (CSB) and Controlled Sequential Factorial Design (CSFD) are two new screening methods for simulations. Both methods control the Type I Error and power of the screening results. The scenarios at which each method is most efficient are complementary. This paper proposes a two-stage hybrid approach to combine CSB and CSFD. The new method usually has the same error control as CSB and CSFD and are more efficient than either component method.</br>
