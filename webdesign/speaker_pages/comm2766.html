Title: Robust Knapsack Polyhedron<br>Author: Alper Atamturk, Associate Professor, University of California at Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, atamturk@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Muhong Zhang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a polyhedral study of a knapsack problem with uncertain coefficients in the objective and constraint. We discuss the strength of the valid inequalities and the corresponding separation problems. We also give some simple special cases.
