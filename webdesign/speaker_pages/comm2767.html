Title: Robust Dynamic Programming for Markov Decision Processes with Uncertain Transition Matrices<br>Author: Baohua Li, Research Associate, Arizona State University, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States, Baohua.Li@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jennie Si<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Markov decision processes with uncertain stationary transition matrices are discussed. These matrices are classified into independent and correlated cases. A new criterion of quadratic total value function is proposed to formulate robust dynamic programming solutions. Approximate robust policy iterations are developed to obtain stationary near-optimal policies surely or in the probability sense. Under some assumptions, such solutions are near-optimal in the deterministic policy space.
