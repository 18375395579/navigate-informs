These matrices are classified into independent and correlated cases. A new criterion of quadratic total value function is proposed to formulate robust dynamic programming solutions. Approximate robust policy iterations are developed to obtain stationary near-optimal policies surely or in the probability sense. Under some assumptions, such solutions are near-optimal in the deterministic policy space.</br>
