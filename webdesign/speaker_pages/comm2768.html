We consider a canonical setup that is general enough to encompass several stochastic volatility models proposed in literature. We describe the arising free-boundary problem and present a method to efficiently solve it. Examples illustrating the generality of the method are provided, together with comparisons against existing methods to validate our numerical results.</br>
