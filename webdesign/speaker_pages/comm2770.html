Title: Generation and Storage Dispatch in Stochastic Electricity Networks<br>Author: Lawrence V.

The system faces either stochastic loads or supply disruptions. We solve the problems heuristically by decomposing them into several single-generator, single-battery, multi-load systems and solving them optimally using dynamic programming. We discuss our heuristic's computational performance as well as insights gained from the models.
