Assuming discrete distributions of future demands, we pre-allocate multiple ATO components into distinct time-product buckets by using a stochastic linear programming (SLP) model. The two-stage SLP model is solved with L-shaped decomposition method.  The SLP solution is tested against simulated continuous demand distributions.</br>
