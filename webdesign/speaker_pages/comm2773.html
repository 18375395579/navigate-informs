Title: On Branching on General Hyperplanes for Mixed Integer Programming<br>Author: Ashutosh Mahajan, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Bethelehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, asm4@Lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Most implementations of branch-and-bound method for solving Mixed Integer Programs (MIPs) consider branching on variable-disjunctions only. We consider the problem of selecting more general disjunctions for branching. We study two criteria for selecting best such disjunctions: integer width and maximizing lower bound. We formulate this problem as a MIP and solve it using a standard solver. We report the effects of using these hyperplanes on the size of the tree for some instances.
