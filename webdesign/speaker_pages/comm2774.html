Sample realizations of load and wind are generated using Gaussian copula. Candidate solutions for 200 and 300 random samples are represented. A 95% confidence interval on the optimality gap is assessed for the solution quality of a candidate stochastic solution. Optimal power flow is solved based on the linearized direct current (DC) power flow.</br>
