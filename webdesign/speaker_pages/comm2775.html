Title: Improving Performance of Linear and Mixed Integer Programs<br>Author: Alexandra Newman, Associate Professor, Colorado School of Mines, 1500 Illinois Street, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, anewman@mines.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Even with state-of-the-art hardware and software, linear and mixed  integer programs can require a significant amount of computing time to  reach  an optimal or near-optimal solution. Careful modeling constructs and  specific use of commercial algorithms can vastly improve performance. In this talk,  we present examples of correct use of modeling languages, good model formulation,  and algorithmic selection and parameter tuning that enhance optimization model  performance.
