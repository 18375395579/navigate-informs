We employ SOS1 and SOS2 variables to approximate nonlinearity with linear constraints, and compare the results with an SAA-based MIP reformulation of the orignal problem. In general, SOS1 computationally performs better than the other two approximation approaches, tested on random network instances with various distribution settings of arc weights.</br>
