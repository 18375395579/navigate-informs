Title: Simulation-based Optimization Method for Consumption-investment with Proportional Transaction Costs<br>Author: Zhen Liu, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota at Twin Cities, 206 Church St S.E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, zhenliu@umn.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the consumption-investment problem with proportional transaction costs over an infinite time horizon. Following Han and Van Roy (2011), we write the value function as the solution to an infinite-dimensional linear program, then approximate the value function by a nonlinear program, where the transaction costs are explicitly formulated as linear constraints.
