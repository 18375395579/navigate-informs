Title: Reliability of Weighted Voting Systems from a Multistate Perspective<br>Author: Jose Emmanuel Ramirez-Marquez, Assistant Professor, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, jmarquez@stevens.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This research presents reliability modeling, estimation and optimization techniques for Weighted Voting Systems. The functional structure of WVS is used to model its reliability as a multi-state system. Next, an exact computational approach based on multi-state minimal cut and path vectors is introduced. Similarly, a Monte-Carlo simulation approach that estimates system reliability efficiently is provided. Finally, an optimization heuristic is presented for maximizing the reliability of WVS.
