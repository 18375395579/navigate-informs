<br>Title: A Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm for Dynamic Vehicle Routing</br><br>Author: Michel Gendreau, Professor, Universit?de Montréal, C.P. 6128, Succ. Centre-ville, Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada, michelg@crt.umontreal.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mohamed Barkaoui</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The quality of the convergence process in genetic algorithms depends on the specific choice of strategies and combinations of operators. In this talk, we address this problem by introducing a new approach that uses the concept of coevolution. Application of this approach will be presented for the dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows.Comparisons with classical genetic algorithms will be presented w.r.t. to the robustness and the quality of the solutions produced.</br>
