Title: Optimal Design of Regions for Liver Transplantation: A Stochastic Programming Approach<br>Author: Mehmet Demirci, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, mcd21@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brady Hunsaker, Mark Roberts, Andrew Schaefer<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Currently the in the U.S., a harvested liver is offered hierarchically, first within the local area, then regionally and finally nationwide. We consider the problem of optimizing the design of regions for liver transplantation across the U.S. We employ a two-stage stochastic programming approach where the scenarios give snapshots of the waiting list and a pricing problem generates promising regions. We adopt a branch-and-price framework and present preliminary computational results.
