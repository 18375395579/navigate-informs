Title: Two-stage Stochastic Hierarchical Multiple Risk Problems<br>Author: Cole Smith, Associate Professor, University of Florida, The University of Florida, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States of America, j.cole.smith@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Hanif Sherali<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a class of two-stage stochastic risk management problems with binary first-stage variables.  Second-stage variables for each scenario include continuous recourse decisions, and a hierarchy of binary variables that represent whether or not certain risk levels have been incurred. The objective minimizes the cost of the first-stage decisions, plus the expected risk penalties. We adopt an RLT-based procedure to cast the problem into a form that is amenable to Benders decomposition.
