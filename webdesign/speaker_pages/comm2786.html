Title: Primal-dual Algorithms for Inventory Problems with General Concave Costs<br>Author: Dan Stratila, MIT, dstrat@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Magnanti<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Recently, we introduced a general technique for obtaining primal-dual algorithms for concave cost problems based on such algorithms for fixed charge problems. By applying our technique together with existing primal-dual algorithms for deterministic inventory models, we obtain a new algorithm for the lot-sizing problem with concave ordering costs, and a new 2-approximation algorithm for the joint replenishment problem with concave ordering costs. We also discuss more general inventory models.
