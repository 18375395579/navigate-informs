By applying our technique together with existing primal-dual algorithms for deterministic inventory models, we obtain a new algorithm for the lot-sizing problem with concave ordering costs, and a new 2-approximation algorithm for the joint replenishment problem with concave ordering costs. We also discuss more general inventory models.</br>
