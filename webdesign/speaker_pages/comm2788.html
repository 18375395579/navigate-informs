Title: Branch-and-Cut Algorithms for Chance-constrained Packing Problem<br>Author: Yongjia Song, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, 3241 Mechanical Engineering Building, Madison, United States of America, ysong29@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Luedtke, Simge Kucukyavuz<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the chance-constrained packing problem with random item weights. We propose new inequalities based on probabilistic covers and strategies for lifting them. We also present a decomposed projection from the extended MIP formulation.
