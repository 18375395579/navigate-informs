<br>Title: Branch-and-Cut Algorithms for Chance-constrained Packing Problem</br><br>Author: Yongjia Song, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, 3241 Mechanical Engineering Building, Madison, United States of America, ysong29@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Luedtke, Simge Kucukyavuz</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the chance-constrained packing problem with random item weights. We propose new inequalities based on probabilistic covers and strategies for lifting them. We also present a decomposed projection from the extended MIP formulation.</br>
