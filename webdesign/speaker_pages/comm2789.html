Ranji Ranjithan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: An iterative method that integrates data mining algorithms with optimization methods is developed to help decision makers (DMs) find the best compromise solution.  DMs' rankings of systematically generated Pareto- and near-Pareto-optimal alternatives are processed using data mining algorithms to discover DMs' implicit preferences, both in objective space and decision space. These rankings are then used in the search method.  This method is being applied to a solid waste management problem.</br>
