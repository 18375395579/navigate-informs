Title: Optimal Transmission Switching?Sensitivity Analysis and Extensions<br>Author: Kory Hedman, PhD student, University of California, Berkeley, Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94709, United States of America, kwh@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren, Emily Bartholomew Fisher, Richard O'Neill<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Optimal transmission switching determines the optimal state, open or closed, for all branches in the electricity network flow problem as well as the optimal generator dispatch levels in order to minimize total cost. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program (MIP), based on the traditional DC optimal power flow (DCOPF). We then use this formulation to examine the potential for improving generation dispatches by optimizing transmission topology for well-known IEEE test cases.
