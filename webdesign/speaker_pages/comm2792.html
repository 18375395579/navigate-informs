Title: Decentralized Computation of Pareto Points in Multi-objective Optimization<br>Author: Brian Dandurand, Clemson University, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, bdandur@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Margaret Wiecek<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Solution generation for multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) available through MOP subproblems require distributed solution approaches subject to restricted coordination of subproblem solutions. Algorithms are stated and analyzed for convergence based on the adaptation, extension, and integration of existing theory of Gauss-Seidel methods, augmented Lagrangian coordination, and MOP solution techniques. Applications and examples are given.
