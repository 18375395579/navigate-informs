Title: A Fast Swap Heuristic for Location-allocation Problems Using Spatial Indices<br>Author: Rahul Nair, Graduate Student, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, rahul@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elise Miller-Hooks<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a fast swap heuristic for the location-allocation problems that uses a spatial index. By maintaining additional information at nodes of the spatial index, the number of swap evaluations can be reduced significantly compared to traditional exchange implementations. These gains are attractive since swap procedures are the mainstay of heuristic approaches to the problem. These results indicate the role of specialized heuristics for spatial problems.
