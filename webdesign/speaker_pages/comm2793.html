By maintaining additional information at nodes of the spatial index, the number of swap evaluations can be reduced significantly compared to traditional exchange implementations. These gains are attractive since swap procedures are the mainstay of heuristic approaches to the problem. These results indicate the role of specialized heuristics for spatial problems.</br>
