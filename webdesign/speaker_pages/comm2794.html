Title: A Branch-and-Price-and-Cut Algorithm for Batch Annealing in Steel Industry<br>Author: Ying Meng, Northeastern University, The Logistics Institute, Shenyang, 110004, China, ymeng@tli.neu.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Lixin Tang, Zhi-Long Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a batching decisions problem arising in the batch annealing operations and propose a  branch-and-price-and-cut solution algorithm.  To strengthen the upper bound, in addition to  new columns, some valid inequalities are  added to the formulation in every iteration of the column generation process.  A variable reduction strategy is also proposed to accelerate the algorithm.  For some special cases, polynomial-time solution methods are proposed to solve the problem optimally.
