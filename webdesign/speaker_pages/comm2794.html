To strengthen the upper bound, in addition to  new columns, some valid inequalities are  added to the formulation in every iteration of the column generation process.  A variable reduction strategy is also proposed to accelerate the algorithm.  For some special cases, polynomial-time solution methods are proposed to solve the problem optimally.</br>
