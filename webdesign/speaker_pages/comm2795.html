<br>Title: Smoothed Online Convex Optimization</br><br>Author: Adam Wierman, Assistant Professor, Caltech, 1200 E. California Blvd., Pasadena, CA, 91125, United States of America, adamw@caltech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lachlan Andrew, Minghong Lin, Alan Roytman</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Out work on sustainable data center design during the last  few years has repeatedly led us to a class of problems we term  smoothed online convex optimization (SOCO) problems. SOCO is a  variant of the class of online convex optimization (OCO) problems,  and is strongly related to the class of metrical task systems, each  of which have been studied largely independently. In this talk I will discuss some recent progress toward unifying the results and algorithms from these communities.</br>
