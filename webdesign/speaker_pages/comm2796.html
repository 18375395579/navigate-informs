Title: Flow and Cut Models for the Minimum Energy Broadcasting Problem in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks<br>Author: Dag Haugland, Associate Professor, University of Bergen, Department of Informatics,, PB. 7803, Bergen, N-, 5020, Norway, nmidd@uib.no<br>Coauthor(s): Joanna Bauer, Di Yuan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop flow and cut-based integer programming models for the problem of minimizing the total energy of a broadcast session in wireless ad hoc networks. The strength of the models is analyzed theoretically, and we prove that the strongest flow-based model and its cut-based counterpart are equally strong. By expanding the network, we also show how the problem can be transformed to the minimum Steiner tree problem in digraphs. Reports on numerical experiments comparing the models are provided.
