The strength of the models is analyzed theoretically, and we prove that the strongest flow-based model and its cut-based counterpart are equally strong. By expanding the network, we also show how the problem can be transformed to the minimum Steiner tree problem in digraphs. Reports on numerical experiments comparing the models are provided.</br>
