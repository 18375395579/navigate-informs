Such problems are common in a broad range of practical applications and the NP method is therefore applicable to many operational and planning problems in both manufacturing and service industries. In this tutorial we introduce how to implement the NP method, demonstrate its key convergence properties, show how to integrate other exact and heuristic optimization methods into the very general framework the NP method provides, and evaluate its performance relative to other comparable methods. We also present several case studies from application areas that include supply chain management, health care delivery, and data mining.</br>
