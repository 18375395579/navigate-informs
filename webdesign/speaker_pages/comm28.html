Title: Competitive Supply Chain Design for the Emerging Biofuel Industry<br>Author: Yun Bai, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N. Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, United States of America, yunbai1@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jong-Shi Pang, Yanfeng Ouyang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a competitive supply chain design problem for an emerging industry which competes for resource supply with existing industries. A Stackelberg leader-follower game model is proposed to determine optimal facility location, scouring and pricing for the emerging industry, resource allocation for multiple suppliers. Lagrangian relaxation based solution approach is developed to solve the DC-MPEC model efficiently for large scale problem instances.
