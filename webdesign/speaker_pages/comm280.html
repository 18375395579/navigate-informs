Title: A Capacitated Model for the Simultaneous Optimization of Facility Location and Inventory Decisions<br>Author: Burcu Keskin, Assistant Professor, University of Alabama, Operations Management, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States of America, bkeskin@cba.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sila Cetinkaya, Halit Uster<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recent research has indicated substantial benefits with the integration of facility location and inventory decisions. Motivated by these results, we consider a two-stage integrated facility location and inventory problem while taking total logistics costs and real-life capacity restrictions into account. We model the problem as a nonlinear mixed integer program and develop efficient solution approaches. We present numerical results that illustrate the benefits of integrated decision making.
