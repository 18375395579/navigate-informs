Motivated by these results, we consider a two-stage integrated facility location and inventory problem while taking total logistics costs and real-life capacity restrictions into account. We model the problem as a nonlinear mixed integer program and develop efficient solution approaches. We present numerical results that illustrate the benefits of integrated decision making.</br>
