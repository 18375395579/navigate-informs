The stoch prog has a random variable as solution, making the stochastic approximation infinite dimensional and unimplementable. Assuming the solution to lie in a Hilbert space we give a new finite dimensional approach that is soundly justifiable and computationally efficient. Bounds on the dimensionality needed are provided.</br>
