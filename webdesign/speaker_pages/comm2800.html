Title: Finite Dimensional Approach to Stochastic Approximation in Hilbert Space<br>Author: Ankur Kulkarni, PhD Student, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States of America, akulkar3@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vivek Borkar<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We address a convex stoch prog where the underlying probability measure is not necessarily a counting measure and provide a stochastic approximation algorithm for the same. The stoch prog has a random variable as solution, making the stochastic approximation infinite dimensional and unimplementable. Assuming the solution to lie in a Hilbert space we give a new finite dimensional approach that is soundly justifiable and computationally efficient. Bounds on the dimensionality needed are provided.
