An example of such application is the transportation of medical specimens. We propose better vehicle routing solutions that can efficiently satisfy random demand and urgent requests. We formulate a multi-trip vehicle routing problem, and devise a heuristic based on insertion and Tabu search. Simulations on randomly generated data and on real-world data show significant improvement from existing methods.</br>
