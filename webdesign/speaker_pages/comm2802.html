Title: A New Approach for Routing Courier Delivery Services with Urgent Demand<br>Author: Chen Wang, University of Southern California, University Park Campus, Los Angeles, CA, 90007, United States of America, wang20@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fernando Ordonez, Maged Dessouky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The courier delivery industry is faced with random demand, as well as urgent requests. An example of such application is the transportation of medical specimens. We propose better vehicle routing solutions that can efficiently satisfy random demand and urgent requests. We formulate a multi-trip vehicle routing problem, and devise a heuristic based on insertion and Tabu search. Simulations on randomly generated data and on real-world data show significant improvement from existing methods.
