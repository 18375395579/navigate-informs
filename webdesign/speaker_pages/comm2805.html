Title: An Outer Approximation Algorithm for the Robust Shortest Path Problem<br>Author: Mehrdad Shahabi, PhD Student, West Virginia University, 1227 Pineview Dr, Morgantown, WV, 26505, United States of America, mehrdad.shahabi@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Avinash Unnikrishnan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The mean standard deviation shortest path problem is reformulated as a  conic quadratic program, and an outer-approximation algorithm based  algorithm is developed.  Numerical experiments show that the  outer-approximation algorithm significantly outperforms standard integer  programming algorithms. Preliminary results are shown demonstrating the  efficiency of this algorithm for the mean variance case.
