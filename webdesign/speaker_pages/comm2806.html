<br>Title: Mechanism Design for Stochastic Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Samuel Ieong, Stanford University, 353 Serra Mall, Rm 120, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, sieong@cs.stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mukund Sundararajan, Anthony Man-Cho So</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We design economic mechanisms for eliciting optimization parameters  privately known to selfish agents in two-stage stochastic optimization  problems.  We show that the expected welfare maximizer can be  implemented in perfect Bayesian equilibrium.  We study algorithmic  issues that arise in implementation, and demonstrate a tradeoff  between computational efficiency and incentive guarantee.</br>
