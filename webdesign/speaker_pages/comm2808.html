Title: Approximation Algorithms for Location-routing Problems: Creating Benchmark for Strategic Decisions.<br>Author: Mozart Menezes, Associate Professor, University of Calgary, 2500 University Dr. SE, Calgary, AB, T2G5R4, Canada, mozart.menezes@utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Vedat Verter, Rongbing Huang, Serigne Gueye<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We aim in identifying opportunities for improvement in real-world location-routing problems. Create an approximation scheme for location and routing problems that is easy to implement, provides a reasonable good feasible solution, provides lower bounds on costs, and provides procedures for adapting different real situations so the scheme presented could be used.  We present results discriminating measures such as vehicles?capacity utilization, technology, distance travelled, and CO2 emissions.
