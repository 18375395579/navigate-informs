The core of the method is a randomized dependent rounding scheme, called geometric rounding. We apply this method to solve the winner determination problem in a single-minded combinatorial auction and prove its advantage on sparse auctions. It also provides theoretical bounds for the multi-unit combinational auction problem.</br>
