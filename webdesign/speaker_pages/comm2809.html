Title: Geometric Rounding and Resource Allocation Problems<br>Author: Dongdong Ge, Stanford University, 37 Angell Ct Apt 201, STANFORD, CA, 94305, United States of America, dongdong@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Simai He, Zizhuo Wang, Yinyu Ye, Shuzhong Zhang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper presents a general technique to develop approximation algorithms for resource allocation problems with integral assignment constraints. The core of the method is a randomized dependent rounding scheme, called geometric rounding. We apply this method to solve the winner determination problem in a single-minded combinatorial auction and prove its advantage on sparse auctions. It also provides theoretical bounds for the multi-unit combinational auction problem.
