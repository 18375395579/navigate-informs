Title: Decomposition Based Lower Bounds for a Dynamic PCB Assembly System<br>Author: Mohammad Yazdani Sabouni, PhD Student, Oregon State University, School of Mech, Indust, and Mfgr Engr., 204 Rogers Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331-6001, United States of America, yazdanim@onid.orst.edu<br>Coauthor(s): R. Logen Logendran<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce the problem of integrating internal (machine) and external (kitting) setup times and a dynamic assembly system in the assembly of printed circuit boards (PCBs). Two algorithms are developed for this problem. Since obtaining the optimal solutions is practically difficult or even impossible, to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms, we use the Branch-and-Price methodology to decompose the original problem and iteratively construct a lower bound.
