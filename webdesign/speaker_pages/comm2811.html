Title: Listing Unique Fractional Factorial Designs<br>Author: Abhishek Shrivatsava, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, akshriv@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Fractional factorial designs are a popular choice for designing experiments. Choosing a design requires searching among all the statistically distinct designs. We provide a method for efficiently enumerating 2-level designs distinct under relabeling of factor, level and run labels. We use a graph to model each design and provide a sufficient condition for checking isomorphism of two designs. We also provide an efficient algorithm for generating non-isomorphic designs.
