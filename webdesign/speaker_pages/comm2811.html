Choosing a design requires searching among all the statistically distinct designs. We provide a method for efficiently enumerating 2-level designs distinct under relabeling of factor, level and run labels. We use a graph to model each design and provide a sufficient condition for checking isomorphism of two designs. We also provide an efficient algorithm for generating non-isomorphic designs.</br>
