Title: Liver Transplantation Timing with Ambiguous Health Transition Probabilities<br>Author: David Kaufman, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, davidlk@engr.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The living-donor model (LDM) for the optimal timing of liver transplantation requires the estimation of underlying health transition probabilities from clinical data. Such estimation may be a source of ambiguity. We account for ambiguity in a robust DP formulation of the LDM in which the decision-maker plays a max/min sequential game against nature. Structural results and a robust modified policy iteration algorithm are presented. Numerical examples with clinically obtained data are discussed.
