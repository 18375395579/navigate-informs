Title: Static and Dynamic Resource Allocation for Perimeter Security<br>Author: Matthew Bailey, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, 15243, United States, mdbailey@engr.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nan Kong<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a model to assist in the allocation of resources for perimeter security, while accounting for its impact on dynamic operations.  More generally, we introduce a framework for optimally allocating static interdiction devices in a zero-sum, one player controlled stochastic game.  We first introduce the general model, then illustrate the technique on a problem of perimeter security, and finish with a computational illustration.
