Title: Portfolio Choice Under Model Uncertainty<br>Author: Stefan Weber, Assistant Professor, School of OR&IE, Cornell University, 279 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, sweber@orie.cornell.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of utility maximization under model uncertainty in the presence of both cost and risk constraints. Downside risk is measured by utility-based shortfall risk. We assume that investors take a worst case approach. By means of its dual problem, the optimization problem can explicitly be solved.
