Title: Building Robust Project Schedules in an Environment Subject to Resource Uncertainties<br>Author: Olivier Lambrechts, K.U.Leuven, Research Center for OM, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, B-3000, Belgium, olivier.lambrechts@econ.kuleuven.be<br>Coauthor(s): Willy Herroelen, Erik Demeulemeester<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In practice, project execution is subject to disruptions. Our aim is to generate baseline project schedules that are as well as possible protected against the impact of disruptions caused by resource breakdowns. Optimally building robust schedules is hard due to the stochasticity of the problem and interactions between disruptions. Therefore, we impose additional constraints allowing us to develop good solution procedures for subproblems of the RCPSP with stochastic resource availabilities.
