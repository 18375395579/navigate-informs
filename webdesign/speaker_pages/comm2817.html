Most reconstruction methods use statistical and heuristic techniques that rely on a priori knowledge about various parameter distributions. We present a deterministic algorithm that parsimoniously reconstructs sibling groups. We use Mendelian laws of inheritance to generate feasible sibling groups and optimally select a minimum set of groups necessary to explain the data.</br>
