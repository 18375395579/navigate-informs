Title: Denoising Monte Carlo Sensitivity Estimates<br>Author: Kyoung-Kuk Kim, Assistant Professor, KAIST, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-701, Korea, Republic of, catenoid@kaist.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wanmo Kang, Hayong Shin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are popular in academia and industry. We are interested in improving sensitivity estimates obtained from MC experiments with respect to given parameter values, motivated by, but not restricted to, financial applications. Denoising and interpolation methods, which have been used for a long time in many different areas, are proposed in a new form which is quadratic, easy to implement, and tailored to our objectives. This heuristic approach is supported by numerical experiments.
