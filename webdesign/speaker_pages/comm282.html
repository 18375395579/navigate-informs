Title: Maximizing a Class of Submodular Utility Functions<br>Author: Shabbir Ahmed, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, 30332, United States of America, sahmed@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alper Atamturk<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We report polyhedral results for a class of combinatorial optimization problems involving submodular utility maximization. Strong valid inequalities are derived by lifting lower dimensional inequalities. By exploiting special structure, we provide a complete characterization of the lifting function and its subadditive approximation. Computational experiments with capital budgeting problems show the effectiveness of the derived inequalities within a branch-and-cut approach.
