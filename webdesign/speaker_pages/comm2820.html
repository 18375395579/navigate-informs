Title: Stochastic System Optimal Network Design Problem<br>Author: Gopal Patil, PhD Candidate, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 4002 JEC, Department of Civil Engineering, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, patilg@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We address the issue of demand uncertainty in the transportation NDP by formulating the System Optimal Network Design Problem (SONDP) as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse. Our focus in this paper is on accounting for stochasticity and hence we adopt the relatively simple SO approach instead of more realistic UE approach.  We formulate the SONDP as a two stage stochastic programming formulation. In the first stage of the stochastic SONDP, improvement and path flows are decided. The second stage penalizes the deviation in the demand realization. One key contribution of this work is in arriving at appropriate penalty functions for this problem. Computational results on multiple transportation networks show the benefit of accounting for stochasticity in the proposed formulation.
