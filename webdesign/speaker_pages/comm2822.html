Shenoy</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to introduce the mixed tree method for solving the hybrid decision problem. We are able to solve the American Put Option Problem with many stages by approximating the conditional density functions using mixed trees, and the computation time grows linearly with the increase of the stages.We compare the optimal strategies obtained from LIP method with the mixed trees method.</br>
