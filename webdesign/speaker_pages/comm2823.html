We derive a class of bounds for the optimal objective value of this problem by solving a number of truncated deterministic equivalent problems, each of which corresponds to a subset of scenarios. For the cases where the number of scenarios is large, we apply sampling techniques. Computational results for several stochastic linear and integer programs are presented.</br>
