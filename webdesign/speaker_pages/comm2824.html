Title: A Stochastic Programming Duality Approach to Inventory Centralization Game<br>Author: Xin Chen, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois, 1206 West Green Street, 224 MEB, MC-244, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, xinchen@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jiawei Zhang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A class of cooperative games arising from inventory centralization is studied in this paper. The optimization problems corresponding to the inventory games are formulated as stochastic programs. We observe that the strong duality of stochastic linear programming not only directly leads to a series of recent results concerning the non-emptiness of the cores of such games, but also suggests a way to find an element in the core.
