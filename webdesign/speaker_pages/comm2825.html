<br>Title: Almost Sure Asymptotic Optimality in Online Routing Problems</br><br>Author: Michael R. Wagner, Assistant Professor, Department of Management, Cal State East Bay, 25800 Carlos Bee Blvd, Hayward, CA, 94542, United States of America, michael.wagner@csueastbay.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Jaillet</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider online routing problems such as the online TSP.   The problems are online since the problem instance is revealed   incrementally. We introduce probabilistic assumptions as a tool   to study online algorithms that do not utilize the probabilistic   information. Under very mild assumptions we show that many online   algorithms are asymptotically optimal, with probability one.</br>
