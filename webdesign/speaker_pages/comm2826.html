Title: Warehouse Order Picking with Cart Constraints<br>Author: Samir Amiouny, Senior Consultant, ILOG Inc., 8545 Orphee, Brossard, QC, J4Y 3E3, Canada, samiouny@ilog.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe a warehouse order picking optimization problem in which there are constraints on the placement of boxes on picking carts. We present a solution based on generating a number of promising feasible pick routes and selecting the best among them using CPLEX. The implementation at a national retailer resulted in substantial improvements in picking efficiency.
