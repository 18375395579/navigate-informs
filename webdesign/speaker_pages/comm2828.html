The goal is to define manufacturing and logistics policies that allow the company to have a competitive level of service at minimum cost. Supply chain planning is formulated as a large MIP model. We solved small size MIP problems and propose a heuristic using a time decomposition approach for larger problems. Computational results are reported as well as an application to a real industrial case.
