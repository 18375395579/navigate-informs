<br>Title: A Network based Method to Identify Highly Discriminating Subsets of Biomarkers</br><br>Author: Seyed Javad Sajjadi, University of South Florida, 4202 E Fowler Ave, ENC 2400, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, ssajjadi@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaoning Qian, Bo Zeng, Amin Ahmadi Adl</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: To identify highly predictive biomarkers, we integrate individual predictive power of risk factors with their interactions and formulate a new network-based optimization model to derive a collection of cliques with the maximum total weight. An analytical algorithm based on column generation method is developed to achieve optimal or near optimal solution. Experimental results show that our method can identify important biomarkers with better prediction accuracy.</br>
