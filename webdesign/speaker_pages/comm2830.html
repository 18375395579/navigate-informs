Title: Equipment Replacement Optimization: Algorithms, Implementations, and Numerical Results<br>Author: Wei Fan, Associate Professor, The University of Texas at Tyler, Department of Civil Engineering, 3900 University Blvd, Tyler, TX, 75799, United States of America, wfan@uttyler.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Randy Machemehl, Mason Gemar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The primary function of equipment managers is to replace the right equipment at the right time and at the lowest overall cost. First, both deterministic and stochastic dynamic programing models are formulated for the equipment replacement optimization (ERO) problem. Second, both Bellman’s and Wagner’s approaches are developed to solving the ERO. Finally, the implementation techniques are presented. Comprehensive ERO numerical results are also discussed.
