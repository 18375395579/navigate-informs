<br>Title: IMBOSH: IMprovement BOundary Search Heuristic for Solving Unequal Area Plant Layout Problem</br><br>Author: Artak Hakobyan, West Virginia University, 1056 Van Voorhis Road, Apt. K 418, Morgantown, WV, 26505, United States, artakhak@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan McKendall</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this paper promising techniques are presented to solve the Facility Layout Problem with unequal area departments. The deficiency of most methods used to solve the discrete representation of the unequal area FLP is that the departments in the solution may have irregular shapes, and the computational time may increase considerably when considering smaller grid sizes. However, the heuristics presented in this paper solve the discrete model without these deficiencies.</br>
