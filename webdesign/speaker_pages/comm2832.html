There exists an aggregation method that reduces data without causing errors. It was developed for covering problem with 0-1 type coverage, and we generalize the method to apply to gradual coverage covering problem. We approximate a gradual coverage function into a step-wise function using K-means algorithm, and a common reachability set is constructed accordingly. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
