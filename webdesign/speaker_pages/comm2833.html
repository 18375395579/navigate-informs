We will show that a straightforward implementation of the ABHC-concept to the Vehicle Routing Problem leads to results which are competitive with the best-known / state-of-the-art algorithms from literature. At the same time this new approach shows a striking simplicity: easy to understand, easy to code, and independent on any obscure parameter settings.</br>
