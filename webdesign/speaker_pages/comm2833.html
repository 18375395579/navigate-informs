Title: Applying the Attribute-Based Hill Climber Heuristic to the Vehicle Routing Problem<br>Author: Ulrich Derigs, Professor, WINFORS - University of Cologne, Pohligstrasse 1, Köln, 50969, Germany, derigs@informatik.uni-koeln.de<br>Coauthor(s): Raimund Kaiser<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The attribute based hill climber method (ABHC) proposed by Whittley and Smith [2004] is a variant of the general tabu-search principle. We will show that a straightforward implementation of the ABHC-concept to the Vehicle Routing Problem leads to results which are competitive with the best-known / state-of-the-art algorithms from literature. At the same time this new approach shows a striking simplicity: easy to understand, easy to code, and independent on any obscure parameter settings.
