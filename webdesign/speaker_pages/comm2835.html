<br>Title: A Computational Study of the Maximum Co-2-plex Problem</br><br>Author: Benjamin McClosky, Rice University, 6100 Main St. - MS 134, Houston, TX, 77030, United States, bjm4@rice.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Balabhaskar Balasundaram, Illya Hicks</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: 2-plexes are cohesive subgraphs which were introduced to relax the structure of cliques. A co-2-plex is the complement of 2-plex and is therefore similar to a stable set. We present an exact algorithm for solving the maximum co-2-plex problem.</br>
