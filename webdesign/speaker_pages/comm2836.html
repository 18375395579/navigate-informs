The proposed algorithm benefits from the greedy approach of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) in determining the support set of sparse vector. Bayesian framework of the proposed method is adopted from relevance vector machine (RVM). Performance guarantee of the proposed method is obtained. We prove that the ideal risk of the proposed method outperforms the best known unbiased sparse estimator under certain conditions.
