An augmented Lagrangian method for solving a convexification of the problem will be presented. The algorithm yields an optimal solution for problems involving r-concave probability distributions. For arbitrary distributions, the algorithm provides bounds for the optimal value and nearly optimal solutions. The method is compared numerically to two cutting plane methods.</br>
