We have previously constructed an adaptive trust-region algorithm that allows the use of sub-samples when possible, adjusting the sample size at each iteration. We here consider extensions of this algorithm that are based on variance reduction techniques, such as quasi-Monte Carlo sampling, and show that substantial numerical gains can then be achieved.</br>
