Title: Fibonacci Numbers, Basis Reduction, and Integer Programming<br>Author: Gabor Pataki, Department of Statistics and Operations Research, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States, pataki@email.unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bala Krishnamoorthy<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We conduct a detailed computational study of a reformulation method for IPs called column basis reduction (CBR). We consider variants that work in the rangespace and the nullspace; solving feasibility and optimization problems; and various problem classes.
