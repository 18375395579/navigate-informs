Title: A Projected Gradient Algorithm for Network Equlibrium<br>Author: Michael Florian, Professor, University of Montreal, P.O.Box 6128, Station, Montreal, QC, H3C3J7, Canada, mike@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Isabelle Constantin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: An efficient adaptation of the projected gradient algorithm for solving network equilibrium problems is presented. Comparison with the OBA method of Bar-Gera and other algorithms demonstrate the computational efficiency of the method on large scale problems.
