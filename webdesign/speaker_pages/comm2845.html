Title: A Frequency-Domain Approach to Traffic Oscillation Measurements<br>Author: Xiaopeng Li, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, li28@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fan Peng, Yanfeng Ouyang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper discusses traditional traffic oscillation estimation methods and proposes a new quantification method based on frequency domain approaches. Applications to real-world traffic data show that the proposed approach effectively identifies important oscillation properties and reveals insights. This method is also extended to estimate oscillation periods that vehicles experience.
