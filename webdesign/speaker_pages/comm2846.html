Title: An Algorithm for the Projection a Point on the Intersection of Two Nonnegative Hyperplanes and the Nonnegative Orthant<br>Author: Claudio Santiago, Postdoc researcher, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA, 94550, United States of America, pratas@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Nelson Maculan, Maria Helena Jardim<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this work, we present a quadratic algorithm for the projection of a point on the intersection of two hyperplanes with nonnegative coefficients and the nonnegative orthant. Interior point methods are the most efficient algorithm in the literature to solve this problem. While efficient in practice, their efficiency is highly dependent on a series of parameters (especially for nonlinear problems). We propose a new method based on the KKT optimality conditions.
