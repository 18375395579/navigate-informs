Res., CP 6128, Succ Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada, bastin@iro.umontreal.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Sample average approximations are a popular approach to deal with complex optimization problems involving expectations. The accuracy is however related to the sample size, so that the numerical cost can be prohibitive. We examine numerical and theoretical improvments of a previoulsy proposed adaptive strategy, varying the number of draws from iteration to iteration, in the light of recent developments in the trust-region and stochastic programming litterature.</br>
