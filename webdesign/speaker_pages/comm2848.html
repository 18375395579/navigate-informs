Title: Supply Chain Inventory Optimization Under Multiple Sourcing Options<br>Author: Stefan Minner, University of Mannheim, Schloss, Mannheim, BW, Germany, minner@bwl.uni-mannheim.de<br>Coauthor(s): Steffen Klosterhalfen, Daniel Kaiser<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We analyze multi-stage safety stock optimization when multiple sources for replenishment exist. The model extends existing approaches for general networks under the guaranteed service assumption. We show optimality properties of safety stock allocations and discuss optimization algorithms based on dynamic programming and a heuristic estimation of distribution algorithm.
