Title: Dynamic Lagrangian Dual and Reduced RLT Constructs for Solving 0-1 Mixed-integer Programs<br>Author: Cole Smith, Associate Professor, ISE, University of Florida, Weil Hall 303, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, j.cole.smith@gmail.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We enhance the strength of Lagrangian relaxations for solving mixed-integer programs, by dynamically augmenting the Lagrangian dual with cuts induced from a disjunction implied by partial branch-and-bound enumeration. These cuts are also obtainable via an appropriate Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) representation. We exploit the strength inherent in such higher-dimensional RLT reformulations, and thus also limit the number of variables controlled by subgradient optimization.
