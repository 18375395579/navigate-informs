<br>Title: Joint Assessment and Restoration of Power Systems</br><br>Author: Pascal Van Hentenryck, Professor, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, pvh@nicta.com.au</br><br>Coauthor(s): Carleton Coffrin, Nabeel Gillani</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the joint damage assessment and recovery  of the power infrastructure after a natural disaster has occurred.  Earlier work in this area proposed an optimization algorithm  for the recovery phase, assuming that the infrastructure damage was  known precisely. This paper lifts this assumption and proposes online stochastic optimization approaches that use constraint programming to solve the deterministic problems.</br>
