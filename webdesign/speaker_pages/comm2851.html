Title: Implementation and Evaluation of Separation Algorithms Based on Mixed Integer Rows<br>Author: Philipp Christophel, DS&OR Lab, University of Paderborn, Warburgerstr. 100, Paderborn, -, 33098, Germany, christophel@dsor.de<br>Coauthor(s): Uwe Suhl, Leena Suhl<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Cutting plane separation algorithms are an important part of modern mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers. For generating cutting planes from the rows of the constraint matrix three separation algorithms are usually implemented: aggregated c-MIR cuts, flow cover cuts and flow path cuts. In this talk we give some details about the implementation of these algorithms, show alternatives and extensions to them and evaluate their importance for solving MIP problems.
