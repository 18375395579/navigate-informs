<br>Title: Many Objective Visual Analytics: Decision Support for the Design of Complex Engineered Systems</br><br>Author: Matthew Woodruff, PhD Candidate Industrial Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, 212 Sackett Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, mjw5407@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We apply a new many-objective visual analytics (MOVA) approach to the conceptual design of a General Aviation Aircraft product family design problem. MOVA emphasizes learning through problem reformulation, enabled by visual analytics and many-objective search. Two highly aggregated formulations impose unexpected preferences on solutions, resulting in a myopic view of the problem. In contrast, a many-objective formulation enables the selection of a well-informed solution using visual analytics.</br>
