Title: MIPLIB 20XX: On the Difficulties to Find a Good Set of MIP Instances for Benchmarking<br>Author: Thorsten Koch, Senior Scientist, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin, Takustraße 7, 14195 Berlin-Dahlem, Germany, koch@zib.de<br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Martin, Tobias Achterberg<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Benchmarking MIP solvers is difficult at best.  How could we compare the performance of two solvers in a fair and meaningful way?  What are suitable criteria for selecting problem instances in a benchmark? Only difficult to solve instances?  Constructing unsolvable instances is always possible. Only real-world examples? People who want results tend to use models that work well with existing solver technology. We will try to propose some answers to these questions. Discussion welcome.
