The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model with uncertain processing time.  To solve the problem, a hybrid method of optimization via simulation and branch-and-pricing algorithm is proposed to tackle the problem. Finally, the computational experiment results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model and method.</br>
