Title: Unconstrained and Constrained Bandits via Parwise Comparison<br>Author: Eric Denardo, Professor, Yale University, PO Box 208267, New Haven, CT, 06520-8267, United States, eric.denardo@yale.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eugene Feinberg, Uriel G. Rothblum<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A novel approach to the multi-armed bandit replaces stopping times with pairwise comparison.  This approach is used to show that priority rules are optimal, it leads to efficient computation, it encompasses linear and exponential utility functions, and it allows for constraints that link the bandits.
