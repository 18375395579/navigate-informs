<br>Title: Disjunctive Cutting Plane Approach Two-Stage Mixed-Binary Stochastic Programs with CVaR</br><br>Author: Nataly Youssef, Graduate Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 143 Albany St., Apt. 014C, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, youssefn@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lewis Ntaimo</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a disjunctive cutting plane approach to two-stage stochastic 0-1 programs with CVaR. We propose an outer branch and bound algorithm on the first-stage continuous variable introduced by the linearization of CVaR and perform an inner disjunctive cutting step on second-stage binary variables. We employ a simple convexification that does not involve reverse programming techniques. Computational experiments are conducted on standard instances to assess the performance of our algorithm.</br>
