Title: A Global Optimization Algorithm for Reliable Network Design<br>Author: Jitamitra Desai, University of Arizona, 1127 E. James E.

The resulting model formulation turns out to be a nonconvex mixed-integer 0-1 program for which a globally convergent branch-and-bound procedure is designed. Computational results are reported for a hypothetical case and related extensions are also presented.
