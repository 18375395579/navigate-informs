<br>Title: On the Approximate Linear Programming Approach for Network Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Cornell University, 223 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, ht88@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chaoxu Tong</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: One way to obtain bid prices for network revenue management problems involves using the approximate linear programming approach on the dynamic programming formulation of the problem. This gives a linear program whose number of constraints increases exponentially with the number of flights. So, the linear program is solved via column generation on the dual. We show how to a priori reduce the number of columns to a polynomial size, potentially eliminating the need for column generation altogether.</br>
