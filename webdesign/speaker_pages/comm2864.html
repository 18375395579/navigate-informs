Title: On Implementing a Parallel Integer Solver Using Optimization Services<br>Author: Sanjay Mehrotra, Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60601, mehrotra@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Ma, Huanyuan Sheng<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We will present a framework for implementing a parallel integer solver using optimization services and standard instances.  Depending on the progress computational results will be presented describing the viability of this approach for implementing parallel solvers for solving difficult integer programs within the IMPACT solver package.
