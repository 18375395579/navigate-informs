<br>Title: Molecular Structure Determination by a Discrete Geometric Approach</br><br>Author: Carlile Lavor, Dr., UNICAMP, IMECC - UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, 13083-859, Brazil, clavor@ime.unicamp.br</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The problem of identifying 3D molecular structures by exploiting distance information is a Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP), which can be formulated as a nonconvex global minimization problem. Defining an artificial ordering on the atoms of the protein molecule, we can prove that the MDGP can be reformulated as a combinatorial problem and solved by an exact algorithm: the Branch and Prune (BP) algorithm.</br>
