Title: A Sequential Response Surface Methodology for the Aircraft Rotation Problem<br>Author: Siriwat Visoldilokpun, PhD Student, Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, PO Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, siriwatvi@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger, Victoria Chen, H.W. Corley, Seoung Bum Kim<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Most existing simulation optimization techniques are computationally intractable for large-scale problems. We develop a column generation approach for response surface methodology using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The algorithm is based upon Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition within Kelley’s cutting plane algorithm. We apply the approach to an aircraft rotation problem.
