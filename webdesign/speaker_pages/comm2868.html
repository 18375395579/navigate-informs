The finished products will be transported by trains. The objective is to minimize the shutdown times of equipment and aversion to maintenance time considering multiple coal mines. We first develop a mixed integer linear programming model and then a hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to solve it. Computational results show that our algorithm can produce good-quality solutions efficiently.</br>
