This uses a sampling based preprocessing heuristic to generate a starting point; a starting barrier parameter; a method for step-length calculation without performing line searches; and a method for adaptive addition of scenarios over the course of the algorithm while generating scenarios using quasi-Monte-Carlo sampling. Results show significant savings for certain class of problems.</br>
