<br>Title: Bounding and Decomposition for Transmission and Generation Planning With Intermittent Resources</br><br>Author: Francisco Munoz, Ph.D., The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States of America, francisco.munoz@jhu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ben Hobbs</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a two phase approach to solve large-scale grid planning problems with intermittent generation. Phase one is a bounding approach based on Jensen’s inequality and Monte Carlo importance sampling, while Phase two is an enhanced Benders decomposition. We improve the convergence of Benders decomposition by including an auxiliary lower bound in the master problem from phase one. Our method is applied to the 240-bus WECC system and tested in both single and parallel computer systems.</br>
