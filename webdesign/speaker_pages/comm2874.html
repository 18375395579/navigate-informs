Title: Hierarchical Target Setting for Large Enterprise<br>Author: Yingdong Lu, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, yingdong@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Debarun Bhattacharjya, Mark Squillante<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We formulate and solve a stochastic optimization problem to determine performance targets for large enterprises with a complex hierarchy. Solution techniques and structural properties  of the stochastic optimization are discussed. Numerical  experiments show that our approach provides better targets than several widely adopted business practices.
