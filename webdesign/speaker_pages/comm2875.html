Title: Price-bands: A Technical Tool for Stock Trading<br>Author: Jinwook Lee, Rutgers University, Rutgers Business School, Piscataway, NJ, United States of America, jinwook@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Given a stochastic process with known finite dimensional distributions, we construct lower and upper bounds within which future values of the stochastic process run, at a fixed probability level. For a financial trading business, such set of bounds are called “price-bands?or “trading-bands?that can be used as an indicator for successfully buying or short-selling shares of stock. In this paper, we present a mathematical model for the novel construction of price-bands using a stochastic programming formulation. Numerical examples using recent US stock market intraday data are presented.
