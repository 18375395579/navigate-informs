<br>Title: Semidefinite Programming Approaches for Sensor Network Localization with Noisy Distance Measurements</br><br>Author: Pratik Biswas, Graduate Student, Stanford University, Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, pbiswas@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kim-Chuan Toh, Yinyu Ye</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A sensor network localization problem is to determine the positions of the sensor nodes in a network given incomplete and inaccurate pairwise distance measurements. We describe a general semidefinite programming (SDP) based approach for solving the graph realization problem, of which the localization problem is a special case. We investigate the performance of this method on problems with noisy distance data and propose ideas to improve the estimation accuracy.</br>
