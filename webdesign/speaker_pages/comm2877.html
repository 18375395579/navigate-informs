The methods are based on the inverse formulation of stochastic dominance constraints using Lorenz functions. Convergence of the methods is proved for general probability distributions. In the case of discrete distributions convergence is finite, without the assumption of equal probabilities of the realizations. Comparison with primal cutting plane methods is provided.</br>
