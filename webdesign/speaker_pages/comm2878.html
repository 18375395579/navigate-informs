Title: Solving a Class of Parallel Machine Scheduling Problems with Nonlinear Cost Functions<br>Author: Thomas Sharkey, PhD Student, University of Florida, ISE Department, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States, sharkeyt@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): H. Edwin Romeijn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a capacitated parallel machine scheduling problem which minimizes the sum of assignment costs of jobs to machines and the sum of convex functions of the makespans of the machines. We propose a greedy heuristic based on the dual multipliers associated with the optimal solution of a relaxation of the problem that allows each job to be split between machines, as well as an algorithm to solve that relaxation. We also perform a computational study of the performance of these algorithms.
