The initial controls are set without complete knowledge of the parameters. After some fixed time T, the controller is allowed to take a recourse action. This problem turns out to be a non-convex stochastic programming problem. We analyze the structural properties of this stochastic programming problem and discuss possible solution methodologies.</br>
