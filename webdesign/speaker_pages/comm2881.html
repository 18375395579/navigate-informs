<br>Title: A Two-stage Algorithm to Herbert-Stevens Model: From a Monocentric to a Duocentric City</br><br>Author: Haoying Wang, PhD Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, 106 Armsby Bldg, University Park, PA, 16802-5600, United States of America, halking@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: I revisit Wheaton (1974)'s revised Herbert-Stevens model and propose a new two-stage algorithm to the problem. Using an example based on monocentric city framework I demonstrate that the determination of optimal net return to land in the first stage can be converted into a constrained NLP problem, which is feasible to be efficiently solved by Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The algorithm is then applied to a more complex duocentric city framework. The results show that the new algorithm works well.</br>
