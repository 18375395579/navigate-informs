<br>Title: The Matching Law: Application of a Psychological Model to a Management Problem</br><br>Author: Philip Leclerc, Virginia Commonwealth University, PO Box 843083, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States of America, leclercpd@vcu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laura McLay, Jason Merrick</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Many optimization models require that human behavior be modeled. We introduce Herrnstein’s Matching Law, a model of choice behavior developed in operant psychology. We explore a class of non-convex optimization problems created by introducing the Matching Law into a preexisting optimization problem, and demonstrate how to approximately solve a particular class of such problems using separable programming. We apply our method to an assignment problem.</br>
