Title: The New Decomposition Solver in SAS/OR<br>Author: Matthew Galati, SAS Institute, 100 SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC, United States of America, matthew.galati@sas.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This talk demonstrates the new DECOMP feature in SAS/OR for using decomposition-based techniques for solving MILPs.  OPTMODEL allows a user to easily experiment with different decompositions simply by defining the partition of constraints in the original space. We discuss the overall design motivated by a goal to minimize user burden and reduce the need for algorithmic expertise. We present results from client applications, including those in shared and distributed memory parallel environments.
