Title: Mathematical Programming Applications of LPECs<br>Author: John Mitchell, Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Math Sciences, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, mitchj@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jing Hu, Jong-Shi Pang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Linear programs with complementarity constraints have many applications in practice. Perhaps the best known are formulations of bilevel linear programming problems and of nonconvex quadratic programming problems. We discuss other applications, including inverse convex quadratic programming, testing copositivity of matrices on polyhedral cones, and verification of B-stationarity in mathematical programs with complementarity constraints.
