Perhaps the best known are formulations of bilevel linear programming problems and of nonconvex quadratic programming problems. We discuss other applications, including inverse convex quadratic programming, testing copositivity of matrices on polyhedral cones, and verification of B-stationarity in mathematical programs with complementarity constraints.</br>
