Title: Resilient Supply-chain Network Design with Multi-sourcing<br>Author: Haifei Yu, PhD, Northeastern University, No.11, Lane 3, WenHua Road, Heping District,Liaoning, Shenyang, 110004, China, hfyu@mail.neu.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Shoufeng Ji<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: With the uncertainty risk of supply disruptions, it is critical for the supply-chain system to be resilient. We study the problem of designing a resilient supply chain network with multi-sourcing, and propose a chance-constrained programming model, and use a mixed integer linear programming to solve it. We evaluate the benefit of multi-sourcing, balance operation costs, resilience, and disruption risk by the computational experiments.
