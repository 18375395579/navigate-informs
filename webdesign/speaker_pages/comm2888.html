It is however not clear how large the resulting quadratic problems can be. In this talk we consider all possible quadratizations(not necessarily depending on a particular construction), and prove sharp lower and upper bounds on the size of the resulting quadratic functions. Our upper bounds are in fact constructive, resulting in new quadratization algorithms.</br>
