They includes existing criteria, such as the margin maximization and nu-SVM, as special cases. Although the new criterion is first formulated as a nonconvex optimization, it results in a convex optimization by employing the nonnegative l1-regularization. Numerical examples demonstrate how the developed methods work for bond rating.</br>
