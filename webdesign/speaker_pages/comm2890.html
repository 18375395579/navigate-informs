Title: User Equilibrium with Recourse<br>Author: Avinash Unnikrishnan, University of Texas Austin, 6.512 ECJ Hall, Austin, United States, avinash@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A traffic equilibrium formulation, accounting for online information and user recourse is provided. The User Equilibrium with Recourse (UER) is formulated as a mathematical program, which is proved to satisfy all the optimality conditions. The presented solution method solves an online shortest-path problem as a sub-routine to arrive at the optimal UER solution. The above model is highly beneficial in understanding network flow behavior under information provision.
