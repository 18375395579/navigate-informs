Title: The Knowledge-gradient Policy for Ranking and Selection with Correlated Normal Beliefs<br>Author: Peter Frazier, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, pfrazier@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell, Savas Dayanik<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a Bayesian ranking and selection problem with normal rewards and a correlated normal prior. Because this formulation of the ranking and selection problem models dependence in the belief between alternatives, algorithms within it may perform efficiently even when the number of alternatives is very large. We propose a fully sequential policy called the correlated knowledge-gradient policy, which is provably optimal in some special cases and has bounded suboptimality in all others.
