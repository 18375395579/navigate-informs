Because this formulation of the ranking and selection problem models dependence in the belief between alternatives, algorithms within it may perform efficiently even when the number of alternatives is very large. We propose a fully sequential policy called the correlated knowledge-gradient policy, which is provably optimal in some special cases and has bounded suboptimality in all others.</br>
