<br>Title: A Stochastic MPEC with an Application to Wastewater-derived Energy</br><br>Author: Chalida U-tapao, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States of America, cutapao@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven Gabriel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). This two-level problem is a stochastic model for wastewater-derived energy with a strategic wastewater treatment plant as the upper-level player. The lower-level players make up the fertilizer, natural gas, CNG and electricity markets. All players are price-takers. The strategic player’s decisions involve converting uncertain amounts of biosolids into biogas and/or electricity for internal or external purposes.</br>
