Title: A Benders-SQP Framework for Non-linear Programming under Uncertainty<br>Author: Ankur Kulkarni, PhD Student, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States of America, akulkar3@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We address two-period stoch. NLP and use seq quadratic programming on such problems. The resulting QP approx. are stoch. QPs with random recourse. Existence questions are studied under such a recourse framework. The stoch. QPs are solved using two variants of Benders decomposition: (1) inexact-cut L-shaped method, (2) QP extension of a trust-region method of Linderoth and Wright. Multipliers are obtained by solving a low-dimensional QP. The algo. is tested on a set of stoch. NLP test problems.
