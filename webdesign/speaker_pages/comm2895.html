Title: Approximating the Value Function of a Mixed Integer Linear Program<br>Author: Menal Guzelsoy, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, megb@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The value function of a mixed integer linear program (MILP) is a function that returns the optimal solution value as a function of the right-hand-side. In this study, we approximate the value function of a MILP by considering various subadditive approximations to the value functions derived from single row relaxations using results from MILP duality and the technique of maximal subadditive extension.
