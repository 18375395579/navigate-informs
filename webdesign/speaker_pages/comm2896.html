<br>Title: Monotone Policies in Dynamic Medical Treatment Planning</br><br>Author: Archis Ghate, University of Washington, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Seattle, WA, United States of America, archis@uw.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A central problem in medicine requires physicians to choose dose levels that achieve adequate disease control while limiting adverse effects over a treatment course with multiple decision points. We propose a stylized stochastic dynamic programming formulation of this problem and prove the existence of a monotone optimal policy in which dose levels increase with disease severity. This result is illustrated using an example from cancer radiotherapy.</br>
