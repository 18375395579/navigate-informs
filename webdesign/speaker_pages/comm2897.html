Title: Novel Mathematical Model and Algorithm for Sibling Relationship Reconstruction<br>Author: W. Art Chaovalitwongse, Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Rd, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, wchaoval@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mary Ashley, Saad Sheikh, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Bhaskar DasGupta, Chun-An Chou, Isabel Caballero<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: There has been a growing application of molecular markers (microsatellites) to study wild populations of plant and animals. This has created the need for new computational methods of establishing pedigree relationships (sibsets) among individuals in these populations. In this talk, we present a new mathematical model for parsimoniously reconstructing the sibsets. This model is a generalization of set covering problem and we present a new algorithm to solve this problem.
