Title: Benchmarking a Mip Solver<br>Author: Tobias Achterberg, Ph.D, ILOG, Ober-Eschbacher Strasse 109, Bad Homburg, 61352, Germany, tachterberg@ilog.de<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Computational research needs experiments to evaluate the impact of new  algorithms. Therefore, many scientists present benchmark results to  demonstrate the significance of their ideas.  In this talk, we offer  examples of pitfalls in the context of benchmarking MIP solvers and give  hints on how benchmarks can be set up in a reasonable way. We present  benchmarks that show the significant performance improvements of the new CPLEX release.
