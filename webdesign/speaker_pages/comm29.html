<br>Title: Electricity Market-Clearing using Decision Rule Approximations for Stochastic Programming</br><br>Author: Jianhui Wang, Affiliate Professor, Auburn University, 9700 S. Cass Avenue, Bldg. 221, Argonne, IL 60439, USA, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States of America, jianhui.wang@anl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Munoz-Alvarez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This work explores traditional and extended linear decision rules as approximations to solve the originally intractable multi-stage stochastic program. The performance of these approximations is studied for a multi-period day-ahead electricity market clearing based on co-optimized forward energy and flexibility (i.e., reserve) contracts.</br>
