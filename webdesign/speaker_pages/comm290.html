Title: Generalized Mixed Integer Rounding Inequalities for Integer Programming Problems<br>Author: Kiavash Kianfar, PhD Candidate, Department of Industrial Engineering, North Carolina State University, 458 Daniels Hall, Campus Box 7906, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States, k_kianfar@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yahya Fathi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a new class of valid inequalities for the mixed integer programming problem. These valid inequalities are based on a generalization of the concept of mixed integer rounding that has been extensively discussed in the open literature. We present theoretical properties of these valid inequalities, compare them with existing valid inequalities, and discuss their relationship with facets of the master cyclic group polyhedra.
