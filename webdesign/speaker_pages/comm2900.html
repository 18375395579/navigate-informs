Title: Stochastic Approximation Algorithms and Max-Norm Projections<br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, 223 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, huseyin@orie.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sumit Kunnumkal<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: If the iterates of a stochastic approximation algorithm are constrained to lie in a closed and convex set W, then the standard approach is to project the iterates onto this set. In this talk, we consider the case where the projection of the vector z onto W is chosen as a vector v in W that minimizes the max norm of z-v. We show how our results can be used to improve the performance of Q-learning  algorithm.
