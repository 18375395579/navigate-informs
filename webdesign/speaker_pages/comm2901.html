Initially specializing to a set-packing problem, we relax a subset of the binary variables and solve the resulting mixed integer program with Benders decomposition. We assess methods for partitioning the binary variables into binary and relaxed, and explore means for recovering integer-feasible solutions to the original model. We provide preliminary results comparing our decomposition to standard branch-and-bound.</br>
