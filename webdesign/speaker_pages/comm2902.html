Røyset</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal search where environmental conditions can impact the effectiveness of the search plan.  We use a multi-period model to task search assets over multiple mission cycles.  Assuming time-phased weather reporting, we use a multi-stage stochastic program to compute optimal solutions which account for evolving environmental uncertainty by recommending scenario-based search plans.</br>
