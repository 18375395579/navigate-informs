Title: Optimal Search under Evolving Uncertainty<br>Author: Jesse Pietz, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Road, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, japietz@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Johannes O. Røyset<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal search where environmental conditions can impact the effectiveness of the search plan.  We use a multi-period model to task search assets over multiple mission cycles.  Assuming time-phased weather reporting, we use a multi-stage stochastic program to compute optimal solutions which account for evolving environmental uncertainty by recommending scenario-based search plans.
