<br>Title: Portfolio Selection Problem with Transaction Costs: An Option Pricing Approach</br><br>Author: Zhen Liu, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Department of IE/MS, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, zliu@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John R. Birge</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We studied the modeling and numerical solution of portfolio   selection problem with various transaction costs: In analogous to American option pricing problems, our problem is modeled as buy-and-hold portfolio problems plus optimization ones. Buy-and-hold problems are solved by Local Discontinuous Galerkin method to achieve higher order of accuracy. We incorporate transaction costs in the optimization problems to find the non-trade region. Last convergence of our algorithm will be discussed.</br>
