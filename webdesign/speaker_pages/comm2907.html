<br>Title: Recovering Low CP/Tucker Ranked Tensors, with Applications in Tensor Completion</br><br>Author: Shaozhe Tao, Ph.D. student, ISyE, University of Minnesota, 2508 Delaware St. SE, APT123A, Minneapolis, MN, 55414, United States of America, taoxx120@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Jiang, Shuzhong Zhang, Xiang Gao</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a method to find tensor decompositions with low CP/Tucker rank. In our approach, no prior knowledge of tensor rank is assumed. The key idea is to recover a group sparsity structure. The problem reduces to multi-block optimization. Two solution methods proposed are Block Coordinate Decent (BCD) and Maximum Block Improvement (MBI). We also use our method to solve the tensor low-rank completion problem. Simulation results show that our new method performs well numerically.</br>
