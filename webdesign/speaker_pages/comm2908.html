Title: Approximate Online Optimization<br>Author: Katrina Ligett, PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University, katrina+@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sham Kakade, Adam Kalai<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We show how to convert nearly any offline approximation algorithm into an online approximation algorithm that can applied to a sequence of optimization problems.   In particular, given a polynomial-time offline approximation algorithm with approximation ratio R, we show how to solve the sequential online decision version of the problem in polynomial time, achieving competitive ratio R+eps, for arbitrarily small eps.
