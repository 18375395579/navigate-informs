Toint<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We introduce a new trust-region method for unconstrained optimization where the radius update is computed using the model information at the current iterate rather than at the preceding one. The update is then performed according to how well the current model retrospectively predicts the value of the objective function at last iterate. Global convergence to first- and second-order critical points is proved and numerical experiments indicate that the new method is competitive.
