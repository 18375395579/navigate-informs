Title: A Multi-objective Integrated Approach for Emergency Response Network Design<br>Author: Jyotirmoy Dalal, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, jyotirmoy.dalal@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Halit Uster<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider an emergency response network design problem to determine supply locations and flows required in a large scale evacuation setting.  We develop a multi-objective optimization model with generalized cost structures and proximity requirements.  We present an epsilon-Costraint based approach for generating the efficient frontier and the computational results, demonstrating the efficiency of the method.
