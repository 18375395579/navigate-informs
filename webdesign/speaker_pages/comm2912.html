<br>Title: A Variational Inequality Model for Road Pricing with Environmental Constraints</br><br>Author: Henry Liu, University of Minnesota, Department of Civil Engineering, Minneapolis, MN, United States, henryliu@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiao-Zheng He</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we consider a road pricing problem with environmental capacity constraints, which has been proposed for a decade without appropriate model and solution methods due to the requirement of explicit functional information and high computational cost. We formulate this problem as a constrained Inverse Variational Inequality (IVI) that has been applied to link-based toll pricing problems recently. A revised proximal-point algorithm is adopted as the solution method.</br>
