<br>Title: Application of Interactive Surrogate Constraint Method to Index-plus-alpha Portfolio O  Optimization</br><br>Author: Yuji Nakagawa, Professor, Kansai University, Department of Informatics, Takatsuki-shi, 569-1095, Japan, nakagawa@res.kutc.kansai-u.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ross James, Cesar Rego, Fred Glover</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present an interactive surrogate constraint method to solve non-separable non-convex optimization problems. The method is applied to index-tracking optimization problems of two variants of the index-plus-alpha-funds model. The fund tracks a market benchmark with respect to monthly return and outperforms it by a small amount, alpha. The two index fund models are applied to the Tokyo Stock Market where high quality portfolios were found for the Japanese 225 NIKKEI stocks and 1440 TOPIX stocks.</br>
