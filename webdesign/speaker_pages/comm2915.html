Title: Empirical Study and Problem Generation for Multiplechoice Multidimensional Knapsack Problem<br>Author: Chaitr Hiremath, Wright State University, 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway, Dayton, OH, 45435, United States, hiremath.2@wright.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Raymond Hill<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present an empirical study of legacy and new systematically developed heuristics for the Multiplechoice Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MMKP). Existing problem sets are used in the study and results compared with a new systematically generated problem set. We report our results as a function of problem constraint and correlation structure.
