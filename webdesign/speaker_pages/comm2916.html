<br>Title: Exact Primal-Dual Regularization of Linear Programs</br><br>Author: Dominique Orban, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, CP 6079 Succ. Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC, H3C-3A7, Canada, Dominique.Orban@polymtl.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Friedlander</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In the framework of linear programming, we propose a theoretical justification for regularizing the linear systems used to compute search directions when the latter are (nearly) rank deficient. We present a primal-dual infeasible algorithm for LPs with explicit primal and dual regularization. The regularization is termed exact to stress that, although the LP is regularized, we are still able to recover a solution of the original LP, independently of the values of the regularization parameters.</br>
