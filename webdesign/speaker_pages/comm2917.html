Title: A Smoothing Algorithm to Solve a Complex Model for Regional Biofuel Development<br>Author: Mashor Housh, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States of America, mashor.housh@gmail.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A MILP model that combines refinery, transportation, agriculture, water resources, crops and energy markets is developed to address biofuel production, infrastructure needs, and policy implications. The model is solved by a specially designed smoothing algorithm based on a heuristic method which converts the MILP to a sequence of problems each involving a minimization of a continuously differentiable function. Comparison between the smoothing algorithm and a commercial MILP solver is provided.
