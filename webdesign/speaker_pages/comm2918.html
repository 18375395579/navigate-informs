Title: Robust Optimization and Regret-based Mechanism Design<br>Author: Craig Boutilier, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, cebly@cs.toronto.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nathanael Hyafil<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Classic direct economic mechanisms, like  VCG (Vickrey-Clarke Groves), require participating agents to fully reveal their type (i.e., preferences or utility function over potential outcomes).  This can be practically impossible in realistic multi-attribute settings.   We study partial revelation mechanisns in which an each agent's type space is partitioned into a finite set of partial types, each partial type corresponding to a subset of possibile utility functions. Each agent  (should) report the partial type within which their full type lies.   While classic impossibility results show that such incentive compatibility is generally impossible without full type revelation, we propose a class of partial revelation mechanisms that use regret-minimization to select outcomes given a partial type vector. We show that it achieves approximate ex-post equilibrium implementation.  We use robust optimization techniques to compute the necessary outcomes and show that this can be made computationally tractable in domains of moderate size. We also describe an algorithm for myopically optimizing the partitioning of each agent's type space to reduce manipulability and social welfare loss.   This allows for the automated design of one-shot partial revelation mechanisms with worst-case guarantees on both manipulability and efficiency.
