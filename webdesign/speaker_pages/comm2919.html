Title: Using GA and GRASP to Maximize Network Value of Customers<br>Author: Hong Guo, PhD Student, University of Florida, Decision & Information Sciences Department, Stuzin Hall 355, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, guohong@ufl.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Customers' network value maximization problem in viral marketing is a newly emerged NP-hard problem. The increased availability of customer data offers the opportunity to formulate the problem. Using genetic algorithm (GA) and greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP), this paper finds approximate solutions to network value maximization problems. Computational results comparing different subroutines are based on both randomly generated networks and real large-scale customer network.
