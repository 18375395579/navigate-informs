<br>Title: New Formulations for Optimization with Stochastic Dominance Constraints</br><br>Author: Jim Luedtke, Georgia Institute of Tech., jluedtke@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present new integer and linear programming formulations for first and second order stochastic dominance constraints respectively.   These formulations are more compact than existing formulations, and relaxing integrality in the first order constraints formulation yields a formulation for second order constraints, demonstrating the strength of this formulation. Computational tests illustrate the benefits of the new formulations.</br>
