X is said to be structured if there exist dependent p rows in X, where X is an n by p matrix. The cogirth (the cardinality of a minimum cocircuit) of a linear matroid associated with X is very useful for a robustness study. We show applications of the cogirth of a linear matroid in engineering and statistics and develop a new algorithm using matroid decomposition.</br>
