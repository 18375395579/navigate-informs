We study a network where shippers collaborate to minimize system wide repositioning costs by negotiating prices with several carriers. The problem of finding the optimal routes that minimize total cost of covering all the shippers' demand is NP-Hard. We develop an algorithm to solve this optimization problem that uses integer programming as a subroutine.</br>
