Title: Greedy Rules vs. Real-Time Complete Reoptimization Strategies for the Online Inventory Routing<br>Author: Hani Mahmassani, University of Maryland, 3128 J. H. Kim Building, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, masmah@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ricardo Giesen, Patrick Jaillet<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study strategies for the online inventory routing problem (OIRP) under real-time information. We propose a greedy heuristic and a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for the off-line version and introduce different rolling horizon strategies for the OIRP. We examine potential benefits of updating plans based on real-time information.
