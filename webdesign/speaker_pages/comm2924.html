This talk will describe a simulation-based, local search approach to workforce scheduling. In contrast to traditional approaches that decomposes staff scheduling into a muti-stage problem, this approach is a  monolithic approach which solves the problem in a single stage. This  approach is used in a highly successful commercial system.</br>
