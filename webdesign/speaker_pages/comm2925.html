<br>Title: Amsaa: Solving Almost Optimally Large Multistage Stochastic Combinatorial Problems</br><br>Author: Luc Mercier, Brown University, Box 1910, Providence, 02912, United States, mercier@cs.brown.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pascal Van Hentenryck</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic Programming, Dynamic Programming, and Anticipatory Algorithms all aim at maximizing the expected value of a decision process, but all three fail at reaching optimality in practice on large highly combinatorial stochastic problems. We introduce Amsaa, a novel algorithm that takes the best of these three approaches. Benchmarks on a stochastic project scheduling problem show that the obtained expected values are significantly higher than with alternative state-of-the-art techniques.</br>
