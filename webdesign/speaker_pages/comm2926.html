Title: Protein Folding Type Prediction via MILP<br>Author: Fadime Uney Yuksektepe, PhD Candidate, Koc University, College of Engineering, Rumelifeneri yolu, Sarýyer, Ýstanbul, 34450, Turkey, funey@ku.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Metin Turkay<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this study, a three-stage mixed-integer programming (MIP) based hyper-box enclosure method is presented for protein folding type prediction. The performance of this method is tested on distinct protein folding type benchmark data sets. Leave-one-out (jack-knife) test results shows that proposed approach is efficient.
