Title: Strong Relaxations for Fluence Map Optimization Under Dose-volume Restrictions<br>Author: Ronald Rardin, White Chair and Distinguished Professor, University of Arkansas, Ctr for Innov in Healthcare Logistics, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, rrardin@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Langer, Jean-Philippe Richard, Ali Tuncel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In radiation therapy planning, the fluence map optimization problem (FMOP) aims to optimally adjust beam/beamlet intensities to control dose distributions over various tissues. When subject to dose-volume restrictions, FMOP becomes NP-Hard and is typically formulated as a MILP. We show how this problem can be expressed as a disjunctive program, present new linear programming relaxations strengthened with valid inequalities, and report computational results.
