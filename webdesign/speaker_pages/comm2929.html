<br>Title: Simultaneous Assignment & Sequencing of Product Families to Minimize Sequence-Dependant Setup Costs</br><br>Author: Susan Heath, Assistant Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, 1 University Circle, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, skheath@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Douglas Morrice, Jonathan Bard</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) as a next-generation solution to a known production scheduling problem. The scheduling problem consists of scheduling multiple product families on parallel, identical production lines so as to minimize complex sequence-dependant setup costs. This problem is represented as a multiple traveling salesman subset-tour problem (MTSSP). We use a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to generate good quality solutions.</br>
