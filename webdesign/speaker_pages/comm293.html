Bldg 2, 4800 Calhoun Road, Houston, TX, 77204, United States of America, ginolim@uh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Allen Holder</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss new solution techniques for the p-median problem, with   the goal being to improve the solution time and quality of current   techniques.  In particular, we hybridize the discrete Lloyd algorithm and the vertex substitution heuristic.  We also compare three starting point techniques and present a new solution method that provides consistently good results when appropriately initialized.</br>
