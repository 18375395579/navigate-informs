Title: A Revenue Management Application of Nonlinear Approximate Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Canan Uckun, University of Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave., Chicago, IL, 60422, United States of America, cuckun@chicagogsb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dan Adelman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: For a revenue management problem, we explore a strong functional form to approximate the optimal dynamic programming value function.  Whereas most of the ADP literature employs weighted combinations of non-parametric basis functions, our basis functions are nonlinearly parameterized. We provide a solution methodology to solve the resulting non-linear program.
