We use an optimal control approach to determine how the allocation decision will change over time, as an epidemic evolves. Our model considers several epidemiological objectives relevant in practice, and non-linear epidemic dynamics. We characterize the optimal solution, identify conditions for optimality, and provide numerical examples.</br>
