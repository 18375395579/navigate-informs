Title: Exact Primal-dual Regularization of Linear Programs<br>Author: Dominique Orban, Professor, Ecole Polytechnique de Montréal, Math & Industrial Eng Department, 2900 Boulevard Edouard Montpetit, Montréal, H3T 1J4, Canada, dominique.orban@polymtl.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Friedlander<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a primal-dual algorithm for linear programs (LPs) with  explicit primal and dual regularization.  The regularizations are  exact in the sense that a solution of the original LP can be  recovered independently of the regularization parameters.  This  regularization leads to a sequence of symmetric quasi-definite linear  systems.
