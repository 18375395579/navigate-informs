Title: On the Recent Advances in the Mosek Interior-point Optimizer<br>Author: Erling Andersen, CEO, MOSEK ApS, Fruebjergvej 3 Box 16, Copenhagen, O, 2100, Denmark, e.d.andersen@mosek.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The interior-point optimizer implemented in MOSEK is intended for solution of   large scale sparse linear, conic, and convex problems.   In this talk we will present the recent advantages in the implementation of   interior point optimizer for linear problems. These advances includes an   improved stopping criteria, better numerical stability and enhanced efficiency.  Finally, we will present computational results.
