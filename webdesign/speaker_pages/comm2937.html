We model a team’s player selection decisions as an optimization problem subject to uncertainty induced by imperfect knowledge of opposing teams?player valuations and draft strategies. We solve this discrete stochastic optimization problem using heuristic search. We present computational results for simulated NFL drafts and fantasy football drafts.</br>
