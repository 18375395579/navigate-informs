Title: And the Seattle Seahawks Are Now On the Clock...<br>Author: Jeffrey Ohlmann, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, Tippie College of Business, 3749 Donegal Ct., Iowa City, IA, 52246, United States, jeffrey-ohlmann@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Gibson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Sports leagues conduct new player entry drafts in which franchises select players to complement their existing rosters. We model a team’s player selection decisions as an optimization problem subject to uncertainty induced by imperfect knowledge of opposing teams?player valuations and draft strategies. We solve this discrete stochastic optimization problem using heuristic search. We present computational results for simulated NFL drafts and fantasy football drafts.
