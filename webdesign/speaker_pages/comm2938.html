<br>Title: Strong Formulations for Stochastic Unit Commitment Problems</br><br>Author: Yongpei Guan, Assistant Professor, University of Oklahoma, 202 West Boyd Street, Rm124, Norman, OK, 73019, United States of America, yguan@ou.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The electricity energy market is transitioned from a Zonal to a Nodal framework in a Deregulated Power Market. There are certain emerging issues due to uncertain demands. In this talk, we focus on studying a fundamental model, named stochastic unit commitment problem, in power portfolio optimization. We developed a strong formulation for the problem and computational experiments show the efficiency of our approach.</br>
