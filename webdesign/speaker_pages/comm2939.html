Title: Very Large Scale Vehicle Routing with Spherical Clustering<br>Author: Fahrettin Cakir, University of Iowa, 108 John Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, 52242, United States of America, fc.cakir@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Nick Street, Barrett Thomas<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a cluster-first, route-second technique that solves large scale vehicle routing problems using spherical clustering techniques. We obtain comparable solutions in terms of runtime and quality on benchmark instances.
