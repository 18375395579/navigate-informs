Title: Finding Diverse Solutions of High Quality to Binary Integer Programs<br>Author: Andrew Trapp, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 100 Institute Rd, Worcester, MA, 01609, United States of America, atrapp@wpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Renata Konrad<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: While the standard output of an optimization solver is a single optimal solution, at times a set of high-quality and diverse solutions might be very beneficial. We discuss a new, general method to obtain such solutions to pure binary integer programs. We use fractional programming techniques and Dinkelbach's algorithm to generate solutions that evaluate well with respect to both 1) individual performance and, as a whole, 2) mutual variety. We conclude with encouraging computational results.
