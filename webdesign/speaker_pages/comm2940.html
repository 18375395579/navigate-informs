<br>Title: Final Exam Scheduling at the US Air Force Academy</br><br>Author: Christopher Nielsen, 2354 Fairchild Drive, U.S. Air Force Academy, CO, 80840, United States, christopher.nielsen@usafa.af.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Armacost</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Each semester, the AF Academy registrar must generate final exam schedules for 4000 students. The current greedy scheduling algorithm is frequently unable to find feasible schedules for every cadet. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program. We present computational results, offer alternate formulations to enhance tractability, and discuss integration into our campus information system.</br>
