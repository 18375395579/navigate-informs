Title: Solving the Redundancy Allocation Problem to Maximize System Reliability Using Column Generation<br>Author: David Coit, Associate Professor, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, coit@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Leila Zia<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The redundancy allocation problem is a well-known problem to maximize system reliability by selecting components and redundancy levels. In this formulation, a custom column generation algorithm is developed and applied to the problem. It has superior features compared to existing mathematical programming approaches to the problem.
