Title: Configuring a Paired-Vehicle Recourse Strategy for the VRP with Stochastic Demand using Tabu Search<br>Author: Alan Erera, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, alan.erera@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Aykagan Ak<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a paired-vehicle recourse strategy for the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD), in contrast to existing research that uses recourse strategies where each vehicle operates independently.  A tabu search heuristic is developed to find good solutions given this alternative recourse strategy, and a computational study reveals that the paired recourse strategy may lead to expected travel cost savings of 3% to 17%.
