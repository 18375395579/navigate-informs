Title: Aircraft and Passenger Recovery with Cruise Speed Control<br>Author: M. Selim Akturk, Bilkent University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Bilkent, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, akturk@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): U. Arikan, Sinan Gurel<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a new approach to solve the aircraft and passenger recovery problems simultaneously. We first formulate a nonlinear mixed integer model along with cruise speed and aircraft swapping decisions, which is second-order conic quadratic representable. Consequently, we could solve 97% of the realistic test problems optimally in less than one minute using a commercial MIP solver.
