Title: Consistent Pricing of Options on Leveraged ETFs<br>Author: Martin Haugh, Columbia University IE&OR, 500 West 120th Street, Mudd 332, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, mh2078@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Ahn, Ashish Jain<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of pricing options on leveraged ETFs in a manner that is consistent with the pricing of options on the underlying security. The difficulty is that tractable underlying price dynamics do not in general translate into tractable LETF dynamics. We overcome this problem by approximating the LETF dynamics so that approximate LETF option prices can be computed very quickly via standard transform methods. We justify our approximations via Monte-Carlo experiments.
