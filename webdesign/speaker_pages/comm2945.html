Title: A Second-order Method for Stochastic Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCCs)<br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Asst.

Importantly, the algorithm comes with a convergence guarantee of providing a second-order KKT point, through the use of both Newton and negative curvature directions. Scalability is ensured through decomposition schemes for obtaining both the Newton and negative curvature directions. We provide scalability results on a test problem set of two-period stochastic programs with complementarity constraints.
