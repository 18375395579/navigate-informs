Silva-Monroy, Zev Friedman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In practice, the economic dispatch (ED) problem (setting min-cost generation levels in an electrical grid) is approximated as a deterministic linear program. However, especially with high renewables penetration, the real problem is both stochastic and non-linear. We investigate the use of progressive hedging to solve stochastic, non-linear ED with AC power flow. Computational experiments on standard IEEE benchmarks are discussed, in addition to parallelization on modest-scale compute clusters.</br>
