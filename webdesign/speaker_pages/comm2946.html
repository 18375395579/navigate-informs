Title: Progressive Hedging for Stochastic Economic Dispatch with AC Power Flow<br>Author: John Siirola, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, United States of America, jdsiiro@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Paul Watson, Cesar A. Silva-Monroy, Zev Friedman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In practice, the economic dispatch (ED) problem (setting min-cost generation levels in an electrical grid) is approximated as a deterministic linear program. However, especially with high renewables penetration, the real problem is both stochastic and non-linear. We investigate the use of progressive hedging to solve stochastic, non-linear ED with AC power flow. Computational experiments on standard IEEE benchmarks are discussed, in addition to parallelization on modest-scale compute clusters.
