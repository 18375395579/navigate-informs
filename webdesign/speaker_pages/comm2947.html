Title: Applying High Performance Computing to Multi-area Stochastic Unit Commitment<br>Author: Anthony Papavasiliou, Assistant Professor, Catholic University of Louvain, Voie du Roman Pays 34, Office b.114, Louvain la Neuve, 1348, Belgium, anthony.papavasiliou@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a parallel implementation of Lagrangian relaxation for solving stochastic unit commitment subject to wind supply uncertainty and component failures. We present a scenario selection algorithm inspired by importance sampling and validate its performance by comparing it to a stochastic formulation with a very large number of scenarios. We examine the impact of narrowing the duality gap on performance and running time and compare it to the impact of increasing the number of scenarios.
