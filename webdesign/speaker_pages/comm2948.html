Title: Designing Productive Assembly System Configuration Based on Hierarchical Subassembly Decomposition<br>Author: Hui Wang, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, huiwz@umich.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Fast development of energy systems entails a responsive and reconfigurable assembly system. This talk presents the assembly system design for energy products by considering relations among assembly hierarchy in product designs. A subassembly decomposition based method is proposed to address challenges in the reconfigurable system design including complex configuration design, system design for product family, and system configuration and reconfiguration considering stochastic product evolution.
