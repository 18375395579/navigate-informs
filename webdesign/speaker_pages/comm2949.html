We show that MOPs with uncertainty in the objective functions or the right-hand side of the constraints are equivalent to MOPs with uncertainty in the constraint coefficients.  For data uncertainty represented as ellipsoidal sets, we transform the uncertain MOP into a tractable and deterministic MOP, keeping the same Pareto solution set.</br>
