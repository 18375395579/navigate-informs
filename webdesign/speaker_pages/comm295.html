Title: A Strongly Polynomial Algorithm for Convex Quadratic Programming with a Fixed Number of Constraints<br>Author: Hans Kellerer, University of Graz, Dept. for Statistics and OR, Graz, E3 8010, Austria, hans.kellerer@uni-graz.at<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider convex quadratic programming problems in n variables with a fixed number of linear constraints and n box constraints. Such problems may serve as continuous relaxations for scheduling problems. We use the Cholesky decomposition to transform the problem into a quadratic programming problem with linear constraints of a special structure, The running time of the obtained algorithm is strongly polynomial.
