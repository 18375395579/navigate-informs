Title: Goal Programming Approach for National Analysis of Wildland Fire Management<br>Author: Tarun Kumar, IBM Research, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, ktarun@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Gyana Parija, Steven Carty, Andy Kirsch, Soujanya Soni<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a new multi-criteria budget allocation model for assigning  national budgets across multiple Fire Planning Units (FPU) in the US.  Causal relationships between the various effectiveness measures and  underlying historical data are learned to devise effective and robust  computational approaches to solve the goal programming problems  (preemptive and non-preemptive). We also discuss our computational  experiences working with representative FPU data instances.
