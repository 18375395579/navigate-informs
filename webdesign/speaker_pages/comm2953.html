<br>Title: Solving Stochastic Quadratic Programs Via Iterative Sampling</br><br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Asst.

However, when the second-stage distribution governing the randomness of the second-period problems is continuous, computing the expectations of cuts becomes difficult. In this paper, we construct estimators in the context of quadratic programming and provide confidence intervals for the upper and lower bound of the optimal value. We report computational results on a  quadratic programming test problem set.</br>
