<br>Title: Protein Structure Prediction by Linear Programming</br><br>Author: Jinbo Xu, Assistant Professor, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, 1427 East 60th Street, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, j3xu@tti-c.org</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This talk will present a linear programming approach to protein threading, one of the most successful methods for protein structure prediction. The LP approach can empirically solve the protein threading problem within polynomial-time, although this problem is NP-hard. A protein structure prediction package, RAPTOR, has been developed based on this LP approach. RAPTOR is one of the best prediction programs in two consecutive CASP (Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction) events.</br>
