Title: A Solution Algorithm for 2-Facility Planar Location-allocation Problems with Dense Demand<br>Author: Alper Murat, Assistant Professor, Wayne State University, 2051 Manufacturing Engineering Bldg., 4815 Fourth St., Detroit, MI, 48202, United States, amurat@wayne.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vedat Verter<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: There exists a convex-hull property where two optimal subsets are separated by a line in solving discrete 2-facility planar location and allocation problems. This approach is efficient for small size problems where the size of the problem is determined by number of customers. We propose an extension to this approach for problems with continuous demand and demonstrate its effectiveness for Euclidean and Manhattan metric based distances.
