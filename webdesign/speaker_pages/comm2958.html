Title: Modeling the Economics of Variable Generation Resources<br>Author: James Merrick, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), 3420 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, United States of America, jmerrick@epri.com<br>Coauthor(s): Geoffrey Blanford<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The US-REGEN model is a general equilibrium model of the United States economy, with a detailed regional representation of the power sector. The power sector component is formulated as a quadratic programming problem. This talk will provide an overview of the optimization formulation, focusing on how the spatial and temporal distributions of variable generation resources are represented. The formulation of the sub-problem to choose and weight representative hours will be additionally presented.
