Title: Solving Nonconvex MINLPs with LaGO- Current and Future Developments<br>Author: Stefan Vigerske, Humboldt University Berlin, Department of Mathematics, Unter den Linden 6, Berlin, 10099, Germany, stefan@math.hu-berlin.de<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: COIN-OR/LaGO implements an extended Branch and Cut algorithm for the solution of block-separable nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs). First, nonconvex terms are underestimated by quadratic terms using a powerful heuristic. Subsequently, nonconvex quadratic terms are convexified. Further, a simple constraint propagation method is applied to reduce variable bounds. Finally, we discuss future developments on integrating LaGOs techniques in the constraint programming framework SCIP.
