Title: The Airport Ground Staff Tour Scheduling Problem based on Flexible Cyclic Work Templates<br>Author: Ferdinand Kiermaier, PhD student, Technische Universität München, Arcisstr. 21, München, Ba, 80333, Germany, ferdinand.kiermaier@wi.tum.de<br>Coauthor(s): Markus Frey, Jonathan Bard, Rainer Kolisch<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the airport ground staff tour scheduling problem. The tour generation is based on flexible cyclic work templates - a new rostering approach which differs from classical cyclic and non-cyclic tour generation. For the shift generation, we include fractionable breaks (see Rekik 2010), that is breaks which are not required to be attributed as a whole but can be divided into fractions. A MIP formulation and a column-generation based solution method are presented.
