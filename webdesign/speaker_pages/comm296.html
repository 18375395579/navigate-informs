The tour generation is based on flexible cyclic work templates - a new rostering approach which differs from classical cyclic and non-cyclic tour generation. For the shift generation, we include fractionable breaks (see Rekik 2010), that is breaks which are not required to be attributed as a whole but can be divided into fractions. A MIP formulation and a column-generation based solution method are presented.</br>
