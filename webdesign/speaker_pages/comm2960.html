Title: Minimizing Rational Functions by Exact Jacobian SDP Relaxation<br>Author: Li Wang, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Ave., RM 236, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, wang40@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Feng Guo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the optimization problem of minimizing a rational function.  We reformulate this problem as polynomial optimization by the technique of homogenization. These two problems are shown to be equivalent under some general conditions. The exact Jacobian SDP relaxation method proposed by Nie is used to solve the resulting polynomial optimization.
