Title: Large Scale Traffic Signal Control: A Simulation-based Approach<br>Author: Carolina Osorio, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Room 1-232,  77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, osorioc@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Linsen Chong<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a simulation-based optimization algorithm that efficiently solves large scale traffic signal control problems. The method is based on a metamodel approach that combines information from a detailed yet inefficient traffic simulator with information from a highly efficient and scalable macroscopic traffic model. We efficiently solve a signal control problem for the entire Swiss city of Lausanne, and derive signal plans that reduce network-wide trip travel times.
