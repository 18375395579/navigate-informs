Title: Voltage and Reactive Power Control Using Approximate Stochastic Annealing<br>Author: Eugene Feinberg, Stony Brook University, Department of Applied Mathematics, Stony Brook, NY, United States of America, eugene.feinberg@stonybrook.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jiaqiao Hu, Eting Yuan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This talk discusses voltage and reactive power control for distribution networks.  We propose to use an approximate stochastic annealing (ASA) algorithm for solving the voltage and reactive power control problem to minimize energy losses. Our testing results indicate that the ASA algorithm yields within a modest amount of computational time near-optimal solutions.
