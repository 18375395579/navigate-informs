The goal is to minimize the total cost for the whole planning horizon, including energy purchasing cost, revenue from the critical peak pricing, wind sales, and imbalance penalties due to wind over- and under-commitments. We propose a multi-stage stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming model and present an optimal stopping view of this model.</br>
