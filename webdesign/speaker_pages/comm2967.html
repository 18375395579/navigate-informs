<br>Title: Multiple Objective Picker Routing Problems with Turn Penalties</br><br>Author: Melih Çelik, Georgia Institue of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, melihcelik@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Haldun Sural</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of routing order pickers in a warehouse with the objectives of travel time and turn minimization. First, we show that the turn minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time. We then go on to propose a polynomial time algorithm that generates the efficient frontier for the biobjective problem that minimizes travel times and the number of turns. Lastly, we treat U-turns as a separate objective and extend our algorithm to handle all three objectives.</br>
