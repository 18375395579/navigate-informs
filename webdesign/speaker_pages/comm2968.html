<br>Title: Optimal Computing Budget Allocation for a Single Design by using Regression with Sequential Sampling</br><br>Author: Douglas Morrice, Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, Red McCombs School of Business, 2110 Speedway Stop B6500, Austin, TX, 78712-1750, United States of America, Douglas.Morrice@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiang Hu, Loo Hay Lee, Chun-Hung Chen, Ek Peng Chew</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we develop an efficient single design budget allocation procedure using regression for a transient mean performance measure that follows a certain underlying function form. A sequential sampling constraint is imposed. We formulate the problem as a c-optimal design. The procedure provides the optimal number of simulation replications and simulation run lengths given a certain computing budget. Numerical experimentation confirms the efficiency of the procedure.</br>
