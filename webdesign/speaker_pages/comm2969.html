Title: Perfect Estimation with Imperfect Samplers<br>Author: Chang-han Rhee, Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, chrhee@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Glynn<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a randomization idea for constructing unbiased estimators based on a sequence of biased estimators and discuss two applications: computations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and Markov chain Monte Carlo. In the first case, the idea produces the first finite-variance unbiased estimators with a square root convergence rate for a general class of multi-dimensional SDEs. In the second case, it provides an alternative approach to perfect sampling algorithms.
