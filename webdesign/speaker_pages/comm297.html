<br>Title: An Exact Algorithm for Power Grid Interdiction Problem with Line Switching</br><br>Author: Long Zhao, University of South Florida, 14249 Les Palms Circle, Tampa, FL, 33613, United States of America, longzhao@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: As one of the most effective operations to mitigate deliberate outages or attacks, transmission line switching recently has been included in power grid interdiction model. This bi-level problem is a challenging nonconvex discrete optimization problem, and only a few recent heuristic procedures are available. In this talk, we describe a column-and-constraint generation algorithm to derive the global optimal solution. Numerical results confirm the quality of solutions.</br>
