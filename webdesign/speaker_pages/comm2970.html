<br>Title: Semi-Automated Grading of Online Exams and Assignments</br><br>Author: Armann Ingolfsson, Associate Professor, University of Alberta School of Business, 4-30K Business Building, Edmonton, AB, T6G2R6, Canada, armann.ingolfsson@ualberta.ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We have given online assignments and exams in several management science courses for about 10 years, using custom-designed web tools.  The presentation will focus on semi-automated marking of complicated problems, where students report an array of numerical values, e.g., decision variables for an optimization problem.  We will describe a structured way of giving partial credit for such problems, based on consistency, feasibility, and optimality.</br>
