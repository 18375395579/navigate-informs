After an initial observation period, the manager has the ability to update the staffing level based on a revised forecast. The manager operates under QoS constraints which can be very general. The resulting problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. When utilization is the metric, the resulting solution can be written in a closed form analogous to a newsvendor solution.</br>
