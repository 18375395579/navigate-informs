Hall</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a capacity allocation and scheduling problem, and design an ascending auction mechanism to allocate capacity to the various jobs. We introduce flexible time blocks as markets goods, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our auction mechanism, and develop fast solution procedures for the winner- and bid-determination problems. We show that flexible time block auctions provide efficient schedules, and investigate tradeoffs in the facility owner's choice of market good.</br>
