<br>Title: Asymptotic Comparison of Popular Approaches to Pricing Bermudan Options</br><br>Author: Sandeep Juneja, Professor, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, HB Road, Colaba, Mumbai, 400005, India, juneja@tifr.res.in</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ankush Agarwal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider two phase implementations for pricing Bermudan options of least squares, stochastic mesh and  nearest neighbor method. We discuss optimal computational budget allocation between two stages in these methods and identify the asymptotic convergence rate of the estimator mean square error under optimal budget allocations. We compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of these methods.</br>
