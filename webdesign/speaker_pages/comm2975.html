Title: A Model and an LP-based Rounding Heuristic for the Facility Layout Problem<br>Author: Zeynep Kirkizoglu, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, zkirkizo@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haldun Sural<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a mixed integer programming model for the facility layout problem. It uses the sequence-pair representation for department overlap prevention constraints and epsilon-accurate representation of the department areas. We analyze the LP relaxation of the model and propose an LP-based rounding heuristic for solving the problem. Computational results are provided.
