Title: Single Item Lot Sizing Problem with Remanufacturing<br>Author: Ibrahim Karakayali, Research Assistant, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, ibrahimk@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elif Akcali, Sila Cetinkaya, Halit Uster<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a single item lot sizing problem for a hybrid manufacturing and remanufacturing system. We develop a mixed integer linear programming model to determine the optimal timing of manufacturing, remanufacturing, and disposal setups and the associated lot sizes. We develop efficient solution procedures based on decomposition techniques and conduct extensive computational tests to investigate the efficiency of the proposed solution procedures.
