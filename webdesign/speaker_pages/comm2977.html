<br>Title: Optimization Models and Applications in United Airlines Irregular Operations: Now and Future</br><br>Author: Jianhong Qiao, Senior Analyst, United Airlines, 1200 E Algonquin Rd, Elk Grove Village, IL, 60007, United States of America, jianhong.qiao@united.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shravanth Gongireddy, Zhifeng Chen, David Newton, Qiang Gong, Joseph Mathews</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Real time irregular operations in airline industry lack sophisticated optimization models and integrated implementation due to prohibitively large problem size, system complexity, and running time limitation. Good solutions against unexpected events, e.g. weather, should efficiently and effectively rebook passengers, reassign pilots and flight attendants, and balance aircrafts. A future system integrates optimization models and pursues globally optimal solutions with reasonable solving time.</br>
