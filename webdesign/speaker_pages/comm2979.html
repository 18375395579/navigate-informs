<br>Title: Towards Globally Optimal Solutions for MINLPs by Discretization Techniques</br><br>Author: Björn Geißler, Dr., FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, Cauerstr. 11, Erlangen, 91058, Germany, bjoern.geissler@math.uni-erlangen.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Martin, Antonio Morsi, Lars Schewe</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We show how to turn any general purpose MIP-solver into a general purpose solver for MINLPs. To this end we construct arbitrary tight MIP-relaxations of the underlying nonlinear problem by extending some well-known MIP-techniques for piecewise linear functions. We present an  algorithm which is based on an adaptive refinement of these relaxations and provide numerical evidence for the success of our approach by means of problems from gas network optimization.</br>
