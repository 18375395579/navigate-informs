Speci?cally, given a graph with edges that may fail at random, we seek a minimum cost subset of edges such that the graph remains connected with high probability. Besides a scenario-based formulation with a branch-and-cut decomposition algorithm, we consider an alternative formulation based on a class of inequalities derived from extension of graph cuts to graphs with random failures.
