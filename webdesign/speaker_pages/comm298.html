<br>Title: Chance-constrained Reliable Network Design</br><br>Author: Yongjia Song, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, ysong29@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Luedtke</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a chance-constrained model for the design of reliably connected networks. Speci?cally, given a graph with edges that may fail at random, we seek a minimum cost subset of edges such that the graph remains connected with high probability. Besides a scenario-based formulation with a branch-and-cut decomposition algorithm, we consider an alternative formulation based on a class of inequalities derived from extension of graph cuts to graphs with random failures.</br>
