The goal is not to find an improved polyhedral relaxation of the convex hull of feasible solutions but to reformulate such that the new variables introduced provide good branching directions, and in certain circumstances permit one to deduce rapidly that the instance is infeasible. We analyze the case of one equation in more detail.</br>
