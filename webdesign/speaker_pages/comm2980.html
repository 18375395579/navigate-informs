Title: Lattice Based Extended Formulations for Integer Linear Equality Systems<br>Author: Karen Aardal, CWI, Kruislaan 413, Amsterdam, 1098 SJ, Netherlands, Karen.Aardal@cwi.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Laurence Wolsey<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study extended formulations for a set of equations in integers in order to tackle the feasibility problem for the same set of equations in nonnegative integers. The goal is not to find an improved polyhedral relaxation of the convex hull of feasible solutions but to reformulate such that the new variables introduced provide good branching directions, and in certain circumstances permit one to deduce rapidly that the instance is infeasible. We analyze the case of one equation in more detail.
