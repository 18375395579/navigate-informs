The ACOPF is non-convex.  The current software is either too slow or fails to find an optimal solution.  Consequently, we solve linear approximations. In this presentation, we review the history of attempts to solve the ACOPF including different formulations and algorithms.  We present the iterative linear current voltage formulation and computational results on four standard IEEE test problems.</br>
