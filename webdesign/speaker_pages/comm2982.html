<br>Title: Dip and DipPy: Towards a Generic Decomposition-based MIP Solver</br><br>Author: Ted Ralphs, Associate Professor, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, ted@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Galati, Jiadong Wang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: DIP is a software framework for simplifying the implementation of a range of decomposition-based algorithms for solving mixed integer linear optimization problems. Recent development has focused on the implementation of a generic decomposition-based solver, capable of either automatically detecting block structure or exploiting structure identified by the user through a Python-based modeling language called DipPy. We present the latest developments and computational results with the framework.</br>
