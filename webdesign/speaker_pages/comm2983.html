Title: Approximating the Stability Region of Binary Variables with Linear Objectives<br>Author: Martin Savelsbergh, Professor, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Tech, 765 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States, mwps@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Ahmed, Fatma Kilinc Karzan, George Nemhauser, Alejandro Toriello<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study sensitivity and stability analysis for NP-hard optimization   problems. We focus an optimal solution's sensitivity to changes in the   cost coefficients of binary variables. We establish inner- and outer   approximations of the region in the cost-vector space for which the   optimal solution remains optimal.  Furthermore, we investigate   techniques to quickly re-optimize when the current solution is no longer optimal.
