Title: Experiments with Disjunctive Conic cuts for Mixed Integer Second Order Cone Optimization (MISOCO)<br>Author: Julio Goez, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, United States of America, jgoez1@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Tamás Terlaky, Pietro Belotti, Imre Polik, Ted Ralphs<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate the derivation and use of disjunctive conic cuts for solving MISOCO problems. We first describe the derivation of these cuts. Then, we analyze their effectiveness in a branch and cut framework. Various criteria are explored to select the disjunctions to build the cuts, as well as for node selection and branching rules. These experiments help to understand the impact these cuts may have on the size of the search tree and the solution time of the problems.
