Title: Redundancy Generation Strategy in Solving a Class of MIP Problems Using Benders Decomposition Method<br>Author: Changyong Zhang, PhD Student, Department of Mathematics, University of Southern California, 3620 S.

By simply decomposing the problem into a master problem and subproblems, it may take a significant number of iterations to search the optimal solution, due to the possible looseness of the feasible region. In this abstract, a strategy of generating redundant constraints to tighten the feasible region of the master problem is introduced, based on the study of a typical MIP problem.
