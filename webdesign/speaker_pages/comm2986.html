Title: Semi-continuous Network Flow Problems<br>Author: Gustavo Angulo, 922 Myrtle St NE, Apt 2, Atlanta, GA, 30309, United States of America, gangulo@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Ahmed, Santanu Dey<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider network flow problems where some of the variables are restricted to be semi-continuous. We introduce the single-node semi-continuous flow set with variable upper bounds as a relaxation.  Two particular cases of this set are considered, for which we present complete descriptions of the convex hull in terms of linear inequalities and extended formulations. We study the efficacy of the polyhedral results on a class of semi-continuous transportation problems.
