(The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania), 33 Oxford Street #219, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, jacomo@eecs.harvard.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider devising a pit stop strategy in Formula One (F1) racing. We formulate an F1 race as a full-information game, show how to solve for competitor risk aversion from data, and note that competitors are strongly risk averse. We show that the game compels risk averse play and matches well with a game class where security-level strategies are optimal. We conclude by showing that our game-theoretic approach outperforms other methods, and discuss its extension to R&D portfolio investment.</br>
