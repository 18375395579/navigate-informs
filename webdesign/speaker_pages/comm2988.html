<br>Title: Validation Analysis of Robust  Stochastic Approximation</br><br>Author: Guanghui Lan, Georgia Tech, School of ISyE, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, glan@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alex Shapiro, Arkadi Nemirovski</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to develop accuracy  estimates for stochastic programming problems by employing robust  stochastic approximation (SA) type algorithms. We show  that while running a Robust SA procedure one can compute, with a small additional effort, lower and upper statistical bounds for the optimal objective value. We demonstrate that the quality of these bounds are comparable with those of sampling average method (SAA) for certain class of stochastic programs.</br>
