Title: On unified view of nullspace-type conditions for sparse and low-rank recoveries<br>Author: Fatma Kilinc-Karzan, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, fkilinc@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Arkadi Nemirovski, Anatoli Juditsky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present general framework to handle sparsity structures and associated recoveries of signals from their linear image of reduced dimension possibly corrupted with noise. This unified treatment includes sparse and block-sparse recoveries as well as low-rank matrix reconstruction. We present sufficient conditions for the recovery to be precise in the noiseless case, derive error bounds for imperfect recovery under these conditions and present efficiently verifiable sufficient conditions.
