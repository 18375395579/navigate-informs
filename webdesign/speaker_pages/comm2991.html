<br>Title: Polyhedral Analysis of the Set Covering Polytope</br><br>Author: Anureet Saxena, Tepper School of Business, CMU, 5624 Fifth Ave, Appt C13, Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, United States of America, anureets@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This talk concerns the facial structure of the set covering polytope. We introduce the notion of cover hypergraphs and illustrate their application in generalizing well-known results from the literature. We introduce a new lifting procedure - Relaxation Lifting Procedure - which is more efficient than the conventional one.  Finally, we give a compact polyhedral representation of the entire class of valid inequalities which can be obtained by sequential and simultaneous relaxation lifting.</br>
