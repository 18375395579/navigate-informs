<br>Title: Modeling Disjunctive Constraints with a Logarithmic Number of Binary Variables and Constraints</br><br>Author: Juan Pablo Vielma, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, 30332, United States of America, gtg531t@mail.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Nemhauser</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: For specially structured disjunctive constraints we give sufficient conditions for constructing mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations with a number of binary variables and extra constraints that is logarithmic in the number of terms of the disjunction. Using these conditions we introduce formulations with these characteristics for SOS1, SOS2 constraints and piecewise linear functions. We present computational results showing that they can significantly outperform other MIP formulations.</br>
