Title: Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis of Risk Measurement Procedures<br>Author: Romain Deguest, IEOR Dep - Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, NYC, NY, 10027, United States of America, rd2304@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rama Cont, Giacomo Scandolo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Measuring the risk of a portfolio involves two steps: estimating its loss distribution from data and computing a risk measure which summarizes its risk. We define the notion of risk measurement procedure, which includes those two steps, study the robustness of risk measurement procedures and their sensitivity to a change in the data set. We illustrate a conflict between subadditivity and robustness and show in particular that using historical VaR leads to a robust procedure.
