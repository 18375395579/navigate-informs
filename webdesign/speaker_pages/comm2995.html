Title: Disconnected or Almost Disconnected MIP<br>Author: Zonghao Gu, Gurobi Optimization Inc., 3733-1 Westheimer Rd., #1001, Houston, TX, 77027, United States of America, gu@gurobi.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Some MIPs are disconnected originally or become disconnected after presolve reductions or after fixings based on reduced costs. To solve a MIP to optimality, we can solve all disconnected pieces one by one. This can be much faster than solving the MIP as a whole. However, optimality gap considerations can cause complexities. We will talk about our approach to address the complexities and several implementation issues. We will also talk about “almost disconnected?MIPs.
