Title: A Robust and Data-driven Approach to Call Centers<br>Author: Xuan Vinh Doan, MIT, 77 Mass.

We compare our approach with  risk-averse data-driven approach using different validation and testing data  models. Computational results show that the robust fluid model provides strong  and highly tractable solutions to call centers.
