<br>Title: Determining Optimal Configuration of Hospital Inpatient Rooms in the Presence of Infectious Patients</br><br>Author: Tolga Tezcan, University of Rochester, 305 Schlegel Hall, Rochester, NY, 14627, United States of America, tolga.tezcan@simon.rochester.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edieal Pinker</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the optimal configuration of hospital inpatient rooms when some of the patients have infectious diseases and need to be isolated. We assume that the demand is random and seasonal. Our solution procedure is based on a stochastic program that uses asymptotic approximations for the system performance under different admission polices. We show the effectiveness of the proposed solution procedure for large systems and derive general insights.</br>
