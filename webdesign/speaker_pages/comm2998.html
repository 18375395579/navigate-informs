Title: Microgrid Modeling using the Stochastic Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model DER-CAM<br>Author: Michael Stadler, Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(USA), Center for Energy & Innovation(Austria), One Cyclotron Road, Berkeley (for Berkeley Lab), CA, United States of America, MStadler@lbl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Mohammad Bozchalui, Afzal Siddiqui, Chris Marnay, Ratnesh Sharma, Markus Groissböck, Goncalo Cardoso<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) is a mixed integer linear optimization tool that has been designed by Berkeley Lab., USA and used in Australia, Austria, Germany, Portugal, Japan, and in China. It is also considered as basis for the European project Energy Efficiency and Risk Management in Public Buildings (EnRiMa). This presentation deals with the new stochastic programming features within DER-CAM, e.g. fuel cells or driving patterns for electric vehicles.
