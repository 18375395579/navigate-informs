Title: Nonlinear Semidefite Programming Approach for Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming<br>Author: Jiming Peng, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 801 South Wright Street, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, pengj@illinois.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: QCQP is a powerful model that arises from various applications and known to be NP-hard. In this talk, we introduce a new class of approximation algorithms based on nonlinear SDP via integrating semidefinite relaxation and a special kind of penalty method. The new NLSDP can provide tighter bound for QCQP than the standard SDP. A bi-section search algorithm is proposed to solve the NLSDP. The computational complexity of the algorithm is estimated and numerical results will be reported.
