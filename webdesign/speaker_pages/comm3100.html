<br>Title: Performance Evaluation for Current Aeromedical Base Locations of New Mexico with Managerial Insights</br><br>Author: Elif Tokar Erdemir, Research Assistant, SUNY at Buffalo, 60 Maple Court Apt. 1, Amherst, NY, 14226, United States, et5@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Rogerson, Alan Blatt, Rajan Batta, Seth Spielman, Marie Flanigan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The current aeromedical system of New Mexico is designed without considering path demand, i.e. traffic roads with a weight signifying relative crash occurrence. From this perspective, we analyze the loss in accident coverage and location error for current aeromedical bases. We also provide managerial insights that will show the relevance of considering path demand. Additionally, we address the tradeoff issues in adding new trauma centers vs. new aeromedical bases to the current system.</br>
