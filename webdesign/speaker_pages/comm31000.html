Title: Bringing Context to the Explore-Exploit Trade-Off: Considering the Impact of Selection and Turbulent Environments<br>Author: H. Posen, University of Michigan, hposen@bus.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Leventhal<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Strategy and organization scholars have argued that firms should pursue  strategies that balance exploitation and exploration. Since March's  seminal paper, research has focused significant attention on the  mechanisms by which firms might pursue balance (e.g. ambidexterity). In  this paper, we direct attention to an equally important question that  has garnered much less attention in the literature: what factors affect  the level of exploration? We employ a computational model based on the  canonical n-armed bandit formulation. We examine the two basic  rationales for exploration: static and dynamic. While the static  rationale focuses on exploration as a mechanism for the identification  of a good choice from the set of alternatives, the dynamic rationale  focuses on exploration as enabling a firm to adjust in a turbulent  world. Our counterintuitive result is that in the presence of  environmental turbulence, the optimal balance requires less, not more,  exploration (i.e. exploit in the face of turbulence).
