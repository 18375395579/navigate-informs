Title: Six Sigma and Simulation:  A Yin and Yang Approach Towards the Pursuit of Better<br>Author: Simon Goerger, Assistant Professor & ORCEN Director, Department of Systems Engineering, Building 752 (Mahan Hall), United States Military Academy, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, Simon.Goerger@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ernest Wong<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The Chinese constructed Yin-Yang to represent how things work. The black and white energies cause everything to happen. But they aren’t completely black and white, and one can’t exist without the other. As OR practitioners, we know the goals of six sigma and simulation as being contradictory: six sigma is an exacting optimization tool that aims for reduced defects; simulation is a robust learning instrument that aims to enlighten. I examine how these two tools can work as one towards better.
