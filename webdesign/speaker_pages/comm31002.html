The black and white energies cause everything to happen. But they aren’t completely black and white, and one can’t exist without the other. As OR practitioners, we know the goals of six sigma and simulation as being contradictory: six sigma is an exacting optimization tool that aims for reduced defects; simulation is a robust learning instrument that aims to enlighten. I examine how these two tools can work as one towards better.</br>
