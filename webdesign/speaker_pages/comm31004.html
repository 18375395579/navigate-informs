Title: Multi-Story Space Assignment Problem<br>Author: J. MacGregor Smith, Professor, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, jmsmith@snail.ecs.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Hahn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We provide a formulation of the Multi-Story Space Assignment Problem (MSAP) which allows one to model the location of activities with multi-story facilities as a Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP). The MSAP also inlcudes the evacuation planning for the facility. The formulation and its transformation into a GQAP along with some preliminary computational results are presented.
