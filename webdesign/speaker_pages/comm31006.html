<br>Title: Online Social Influence and Borrowers?Default Decisions on Peer-to-Peer Lending</br><br>Author: Bin Gu, Arizona State University, P.O. Box 874606, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, bin.gu.wp02@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eric Lu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We assess social influence on borrowers' default decisions in a peer-to-peer lending market. We find that online borrowers are significantly influenced by default events in their social networks. A friend’s default decision more than doubles a user’s default rate. We also find that not all friends are equal. The social influence is only significant among online friends made through the peer-to-peer lending site. Social influence is not significant among offline friends.</br>
