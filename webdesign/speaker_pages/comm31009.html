Title: Trust and Trustworthiness in Forecast Information Sharing<br>Author: Ozalp Ozer, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, oozer@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kay-Yut Chen, Yanchong Zheng<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine the problem of a supplier soliciting forecast information from a manufacturer who has private information about future demand, and has an incentive to exaggerate. Standard theory predicts that asking for forecast will result in a “babbling equilibrium?in which no information will be exchanged. However, laboratory experiments revealed that parties exchange information far better than predicted. We propose a behavioral theory and model to explain this phenomenon.
