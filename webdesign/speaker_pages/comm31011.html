<br>Title: Learning Under Ambiguity: An Experiment</br><br>Author: Yaroslav Rosokha, PhD Student, The University of Texas at Austin, 2225 Speedway Stop C3100, Austin, TX, 78712-1690, United States of America, yaroslav.rosokha@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Othon Moreno Gonzalez</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We design and conduct an economic experiment to compare the learning process of the agents under risk and ambiguity. Decisions are made in conjunction with a sequence of draws (with replacement), allowing us to track beliefs over time. We estimate: (1) Bayesian updating allowing for base rate fallacy; (2) Bayesian updating with multiple priors; and (3) Reinforcement Learning. Our findings suggest that new signal in is over-weighted more in risky than in ambiguous environments.</br>
