Mudd Building, 500 W. 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, xh2140@columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a rank-dependent portfolio choice model in continuous time that captures the role in decision making of three emotions: hope, fear and aspirations. We solve the portfolio choice problem both thoroughly and analytically, and these solutions motivate us to introduce a fear index, a hope index and a lottery-likeness index to quantify the impacts of three emotions, respectively, on investment behavior.</br>
