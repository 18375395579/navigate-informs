Title: An Incentive Scheme to Resolve Parkinson's Law in Project Management<br>Author: Bo Chen, Professor, University of Warwick, Warwick Business School, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom, Bo.Chen@wbs.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Hall, Xiaotie Deng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A major challenge in executing many projects is the widespread prevalence of Parkinson's Law, which results in wasting the benefit of potential early project completion. We design mechanisms that incentivize task owners to complete their tasks early when possible and to report their ability to do so when they realize this is possible with progress on their tasks. Our mechanisms further incentivize task owners to get ready for starting their tasks early.
