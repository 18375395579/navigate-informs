Title: Coordination in Combinatorial Auctions with Unknown Bundles<br>Author: Zhen Hao, Technical University Munich, Boltzmannstr 3, Garching, Germany, hao@in.tum.de<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Bichler<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: One of the main strategic challenges in combinatorial auctions is the coordination problem of bidders when they do not know the bundles, which are of interest to other bidders. We propose a combinatorial auction format, in which we leverage information on losing coalitions, which is collected by the auctioneer. We analyze how bidders respond to different levels of information feedback and overall efficiency compared to the combinatorial clock auction.
