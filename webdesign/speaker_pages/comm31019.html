Huang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Clearly distinguishing between bottlenecks and non-bottlenecks, as well as scientifically identifying the significance of each bottleneck, is a difficult task in a job shop. We propose a identification model of primary bottleneck cluster (PBC) to determine the exact size, importance, and hierarchy of bottleneck candidates, and use hierarchical clustering and TOPSIS to identify multi-order PBCs. Feature attributes of Machines and distance metric of clustering impact PBC identification.</br>
