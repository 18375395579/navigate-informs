Title: Enabling Greater Sustainability in Vehicle Fleet Sales through Customer Oriented Analytics<br>Author: Daniel Reich, Ford Motor Company, 2101 Village Rd, Dearborn, MI, United States of America, dreich8@ford.com<br>Coauthor(s): Natalie Olson, Erica Klampfl, Sandra L. Winkler<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Ford’s Fleet Purchase Planner (patent pending) is the first of its kind in promoting sustainability as a central purchase consideration for organizations with large vehicle fleets. In recent years, several new green vehicle technologies have emerged that present opportunities for increasing fuel economy, but this growing number of options is also making planning purchases a significantly more complicated endeavor. This decision support system is designed to simplify this process by optimizing for individual driving patterns. We are helping our fleet customers find the most cost-effective opportunities for increasing their sustainability.
