Title: Interaction between Transmission and Generation Investments and Their Influence in RPSs Designs<br>Author: Enzo Sauma, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicuña Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago, Chile, esauma@ing.puc.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Hobbs, Francisco Munoz<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We examine how the lumpiness of network expansions affects the performance of Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPSs). We found that disregarding transmission constraints or assuming that grid expansions can take place smoothly may result in overestimation of RPS compliance and underestimation of costs. We show that the interaction between flexibility and the discrete characteristics of grid expansions can have an important impact on the performance of RPSs.
