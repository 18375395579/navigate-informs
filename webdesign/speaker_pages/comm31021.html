We found that disregarding transmission constraints or assuming that grid expansions can take place smoothly may result in overestimation of RPS compliance and underestimation of costs. We show that the interaction between flexibility and the discrete characteristics of grid expansions can have an important impact on the performance of RPSs.</br>
