Title: A Learning Agent for Heat-pump Thermostat Control<br>Author: Daniel Urieli, PhD Candidate, The University of Texas at Austin, 2317 Speedway, Stop D9500, Austin, TX, United States of America, urieli@utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Stone<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: HVAC systems are a major energy consumer around the world. Heat-pump based HVAC systems have gained popularity due to their high efficiency. We describe a learning, adaptive agent that controls a heat-pump thermostat. Our agent reduces 7%-15% of the system's yearly energy consumption, comparing to the strategy that is deployed in practice, while meeting the occupants' comfort requirements. Our agent is fully implemented and tested in the GridLAB-D simulation environment.
