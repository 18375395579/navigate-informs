Predictive analytics can help achieving that by enabling early detection and identification of emerging as well as previously known patterns in operations data, which may lead to unplanned downtimes or expediting. We illustrate the utility of selected data driven predictive analytics methods with real world examples taken from the area of maintenance and logistics of a fleet of aircraft.
