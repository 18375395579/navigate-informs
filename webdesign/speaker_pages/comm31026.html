Seref, Doctoral Student, Operations Management, Decision Information Sciences, University of Florida, Stuzin Hall 361-E, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, michelle.hanna@cba.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ravindra Ahuja<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: To develop a spreadsheet-based DSS, a student needs to learn the definition of a DSS, the functionalities of a spreadsheet software, the technology of a supporting coding language, and the process of constructing a complete DSS application. In our course, we teach these components using course lectures, in-class assignments, homework exercises, and a midterm exam followed by a full DSS project assignment. We find that students leave the course equipped to develop high-quality DSS applications.
