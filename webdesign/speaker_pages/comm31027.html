Title: Algorithms for Streaming DEA<br>Author: Jose Dula, Virginia Commonwealth University, Snead Hall, Richmond, VA, United States of America, jdula@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francisco Lopez<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A real challenge for DEA arises when data stream in at high rates. Potential applications involving large data sets include auditing, appraisals, fraud detection, and security. We introduce algorithms to process streaming data in the VRS case efficiently. Results from computational tests are discussed.
