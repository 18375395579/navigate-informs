Title: Goodness of Fit Measures for Revealed Preference Tests: Complexity Results and Algorithms<br>Author: Frits Spieksma, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, frits.spieksma@econ.kuleuven.be<br>Coauthor(s): Bram De Rock, Bart Smeulders, Laurens Cherchye<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Utility maximization is a core hypothesis in neoclassical microeconomics, and testing the empirical validity of this assumption has attracted considerable attention in the literature. We provide results on the computational complexity of popular goodness-of-fit measures, such as Afriat’s efficiency index, Varian’s efficiency vector-index, and the Houtman-Maks index. These results explain the computational difficulties that have been observed in literature when computing these indices.
