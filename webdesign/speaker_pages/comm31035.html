Title: Arbitrage as Representation<br>Author: Daniel Beunza, Assistant Professor, Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, Management Division, 708 Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, db2417@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Stark<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Existing theories of arbitrage offer a valuable but incomplete understanding of the phenomenon. One literature stream, grounded in neoclassic finance, views arbitrage as a straightforward process of linking like markets for the same security. Another stream, rooted in psychology and behavioural finance, presents arbitrage as an inherently limited in its effects. Both approaches, however, stem from a presentist, under-socialized and over-abstracted view of individual calculation that ignores Knightian uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we undertake a three-year ethnographic study of arbitrage trading at the trading room of a Wall Street investment bank. We find that arbitrage is a cogntive and material process that emerges from the juxtaposition of information, calculative frames, visualization and social relations. In contrast to the existing views of arbitrage as perfect linking device or flawed repository for herding, our view suggests that arbitrageurs constitute a forum for resolving differences in beliefs about the economy.
