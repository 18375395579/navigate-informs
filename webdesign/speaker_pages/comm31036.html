<br>Title: Estimating Usable Habitat for the California Spotted Owl</br><br>Author: Richard Church, Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, United States, church@geog.ucsb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ross Gerrard</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Activities such as thinning and fuels removal to reduce the risk of fire alter the extent and quality of specific habitat types. The focus of this paper deals with estimating the impact of such activities on the habitat of the California spotted owl. This paper develops a modeling framework, including a spatial optimization model that attempts to estimate effective or useful habitat both pre- and post-treatment.</br>
