<br>Title: The View from Onshore</br><br>Author: Frank MacCrory, Fordham University, 113 W 60th St, New York, NY, 10023, United States of America, fmaccrory@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jason Dedrick, Kenneth Kraemer</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Offshoring creates geographically dispersed teams and threatens onshore IT staff. Increased monitoring and withdrawal (absenteeism and turnover) might negate the cost savings from offshore labor. Our theoretical models examine how offshoring affects information asymmetries, specifically team monitoring and withdrawal. We test our models using a 5 year dataset of 5704 IT staff. Absenteeism and turnover are greater on offshoring projects, but modular team design still lowers overall costs.</br>
