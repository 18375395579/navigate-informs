Title: Election Day Routing of Rapid Response Attorneys<br>Author: Justin Goodson, Saint Louis University, 3674 Lindell Blvd., St. Louis, MO, 63128, United States of America, goodson@slu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Since the US presidential election of 2000, political campaigns have deployed volunteer lawyers to provide real-time information and assistance to poll observers. To assist with the routing of these rapid response attorneys (RRAs) among polling locations, we design annealing-based heuristics to equitably and efficiently allocate volunteer resources. We describe how our efforts to route RRAs in one state benefited election day operations during the 2012 election.
