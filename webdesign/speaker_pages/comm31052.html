These analytics are used to quantify resource needs; assess performance against objectives; and determine strategic direction. Five models-The Strategic Decision Model (SDM), Operational Workforce Analysis, Criminal Alien Population Model, Deployment Optimization Model, and the Network Optimization  Mode- are used for this innovative analytics support. The innovation is in the integration of models, the out-come centered approach, and how these models deliver traditional industrial engineering solutions to creatively solve a public sector challenge of immigration enforcement. Over the last three years, Booz Allen has changed the way that ICE talks about, and thinks about, performance. Booz Allen has shaped the thinking of ICE's senior leadership and supported the development of an agency-wide, quantitatively-driven strategy to identify and remove criminal aliens from the U.S. effectively and efficiently. The agency looks for opportunities to optimize rather than just seek incremental improvements. The evolution in mindset is one strong impact of the analytics support at ICE.</br>
