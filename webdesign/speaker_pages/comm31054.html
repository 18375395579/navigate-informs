Title: Early Detection of Emerging Patterns of Adverse Events<br>Author: Artur Dubrawski, Systems Scientist/Adjunct Professor, Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, awd@cs.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We review the use of selected machine learning techniques in early detection of emerging patterns of adverse events in spatio-temporal and event-based data. These techniques have been successfully applied in support of monitoring food safety and bio-surveillance, where reliable and rapid detection is the key to effective protection of public health. We discuss performance, implementation issues and we hint on possible applications of the presented methods beyond their original deployment areas.
