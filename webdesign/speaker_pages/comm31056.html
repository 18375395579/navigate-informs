It aims at providing the next revolution in wired broadband access networks through a hybrid fiber-to-the-curb and DSL last mile architecture. A main component is the joint and dynamic optimization of resources in Frequency, Amplitude, Space, and Time. This talk will overview this project, with a focus on interesting optimization problem formulations.</br>
