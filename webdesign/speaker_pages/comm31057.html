<br>Title: Managing Intensive Care Units (ICUs): Speedup vs. Admission Control</br><br>Author: Galit Yom-Tov, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa, 32000, Israel, gality@techunix.technion.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Carri Chan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Due to uncertainty in the demands of critical patients, the ICU is often congested. Consequently, physicians have adopted a number of adaptive mechanisms–delayed admission, admission control, speedup, etc.–to manage access to ICU care. This work focuses on two primary mechanisms: speedup and admission control. We examine the tradeoff between speeding up service of current patients to increase access to care versus reducing new admissions to enable high quality care for admitted patients.</br>
