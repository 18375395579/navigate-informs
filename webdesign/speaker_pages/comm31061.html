<br>Title: An Extended Model of IS Project Control</br><br>Author: Cecil Eng Huang Chua, Assistant Professor, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, Singapore, aehchua@ntu.edu.sg</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper demonstrates that indifference curve theory can be applied to explain the relative quantities of all modes of project control, because it can model control modes as simultaneous complements and substitutes. Furthermore, indifference curve theory is compatible with and obtains identical results as existing theory. Furthermore, the mathematical nature of indifference curves enable us to simulate control problems, and helps to explain why minimum levels of formal control are preferred.</br>
