<br>Title: An Auditing Protocol for Spreadsheets</br><br>Author: Stephen Powell, Professor, Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, 03755, United States, Stephen.G.Powell@Dartmouth.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Barry Lawson, Kenneth Baker</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Spreadsheets are routinely used in important business situations, despite the evidence that errors are prevalent. However, little research is available on the best approaches to finding errors. We have developed a formal spreadsheet auditing protocol and applied it to 50 spreadsheets from a wide range of sources. We report on the errors discovered with the protocol. We provide recommendations for best practices in auditing, and in building spreadsheets that make auditing easier.</br>
