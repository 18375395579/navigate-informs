One fundamental difference is the underlying delay distribution. A single-track line is likely to have a Weibull delay distribution, and a double-track line is likely to have an Exponential distribution. This study quantifies this transition by simulating shared corridors at various traffic densities at different double tracking percentages. These results will help plan for better on-time-performance.</br>
