Title: The Delay Distribution<br>Author: Samuel Sogin, Assistant Manager Service Scheduling, Union Pacific, 1400 Douglas Street, STOP 1120, Omaha, NE, 61801, United States of America, samsogin@gmail.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Previous research has shown that single and double-track railways  operate differently. One fundamental difference is the underlying delay distribution. A single-track line is likely to have a Weibull delay distribution, and a double-track line is likely to have an Exponential distribution. This study quantifies this transition by simulating shared corridors at various traffic densities at different double tracking percentages. These results will help plan for better on-time-performance.
