Title: Malliavin Greeks without Malliavin Calculus<br>Author: Nan Chen, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Room 709A, William M. W. Mong Engineering Building, Shatin, N.

A recent line of work derives estimators through Malliavin calculus. The question of whether one should discretrize first and then differentiate, or differentiate first and then discretize is raised. We show that in several important cases the first route produces the same estimators found through Malliavin calculus, but using only traditional elementary techniques.
