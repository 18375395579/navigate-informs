Title: Supplier Evasion of a Buyer’s Audit: Implications for Auditing and Compliance<br>Author: Terry Taylor, University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, taylor@haas.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erica Plambeck<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Many brands have recently been tarnished by publicity of suppliers?labor and environmental violations, and have responded by increasing their auditing efforts. Suppliers seek to pass audits not only through efforts to comply with standards, but also through efforts to deceive auditors. We characterize when auditing backfires by increasing deception effort and reducing a supplier’s effort to comply with labor and environmental standards.
