Title: Rationale and Development of a Security Assurance Index and its Application to Cyber Attacks on Control Systems<br>Author: Martin Michael Plum, Advisory Engineer/Economist, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, PO Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID, 83415-3878, United States, Martin.Plum@inl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): George A. Beitel<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Assurance categories were developed to support the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts in the mitigation of Cyber Attacks on Control System.  Defined according to the risk of life and economic loss, the minimum range is designated by policy; whereas, the maximum limit seems to be constrained only by limits and interdependencies of the controlled systems.  This paper will present an overview of some existing scales of disaster and security assurance and the rationale behind the development of the Security Assurance Index (SAI).  Use of the SAI and its associated security assurance levels (SAL) has proven helpful in managing risk due to the index’s ease in use, communication, and understanding.  As a test of reasonableness, SAL-1 meets the minimum threshold limits of DHS interest and responsibility as defined by HSPD-7; whereas, SAL-5 is consistent with the 9-11 attack on the World Trade Center.  The addition of higher risk categories will be discussed for its applicability to other WMD events such as bio-terror events or the detonation of nuclear weapons in densely populated areas.
