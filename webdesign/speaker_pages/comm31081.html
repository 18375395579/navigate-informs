Title: High-Level Model of the DoD Supply Chain: The MIDAS Multi-Echelon Sustainment Simulation<br>Author: Soraya Stevens, Division Engineer, BBN Technologies, 10 Moulton Street MS 6/3A, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, sstevens@bbn.com<br>Coauthor(s): Carroll Keyfauver, Jeffrey Tustin, Daniel Hazen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: MIDAS is a composite simulation of linked sub-simulations that together model global deployments of large-scale scenarios over multiple theaters. We will present MIDAS' sustainment capabilities for tracking and delivering multi-echelon resupply using opportunistic mode selection to satisfy demands at all nodes within complex supply chains.  This includes discussion of setup, tracking consumption and safety stockage demands, capacity-constrained planning, and discussion of future directions.
