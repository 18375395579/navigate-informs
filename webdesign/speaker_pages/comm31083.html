Title: Sequential Stopping Rules for Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Guzin Bayraksan, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, P.O. Box 210020, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, guzinb@sie.arizona.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A critical component of Monte Carlo sampling-based methods is determining when to stop to ensure a desired quality of the solutions. In this talk, we present several rules to stop and increase the sample sizes. We discuss computational issues and compare the empirical performance of different stopping rules on problems from the literature. We also apply variance reduction techniques and test their effectiveness.
