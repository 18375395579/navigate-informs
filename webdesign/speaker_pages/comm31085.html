Title: Social Learning with Partial Observations<br>Author: Asu Ozdaglar, Professor, EECS/MIT, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States, asuman@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Daron Acemoglu, Munther Dahleh, Ilan Lobel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a model of social learning with partial observations from the past. Each individual receives a private signal about the correct action he should take and also observes random samples of past actions. We characterize conditions under which asymptotic learning occurs and study the role that asymmetry between conditional signal distributions plays on asymptotic learning.
