Title: Can’t Wait To Look in the Mirror: The Impact of Experience on the Better-Than-Average Effect<br>Author: Cade Massey, Assistant Professor of Organizational Behavior, Yale University, School of Management, 135 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States, cade.massey@yale.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Robinson, Ron Kaniel<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Decades of research show that an impossibly large percentage of people believe they are better than average in a wide range of activities. In a study of MBA students, we investigate how experience affects this bias. Matching longitudinal surveys about grades expectations with data on classroom performance, we find that experience actually exacerbates the better-than-average effect. This is due in part to students being more responsive to positive feedback than to negative feedback.
