<br>Title: Predicting Vendors?Reliability in Search Results</br><br>Author: Olivia Sheng, Presidential Professor, University of Utah, David Eccles School of Business, Salt Lake City, UT, United States of America, Olivia.sheng@business.utah.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhongming Ma, Gautam Pant</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A search engine provides two distinct types of results, organic and sponsored, and each of them uses different mechanisms for selecting and ranking relevant web pages. Vendors appearing in these results are expected to have varying reliability ratings (e.g., a satisfactory or unsatisfactory record based on overall customer experiences). In this paper we attempt to examine a vendor’s reliability rating based on cues such as product price, type of result, and result index and page.</br>
