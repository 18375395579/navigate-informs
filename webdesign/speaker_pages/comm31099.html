Title: The Role of DARPA in Seeding and Encouraging New Technology Trajectories<br>Author: Erica Fuchs, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Baker Hall 131E, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, erhf@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This study unpacks how DARPA leverages social networks among technologists to seed and encourage new technology trajectories in the computing industry. The results show how DARPA (1) facilitates brainstorming sessions among thought leaders, (2) provides seed funding to unconnected researchers working on related projects, (3) brings funded researchers together to discuss their results, and (4) acting as third party validation of new technologies to latter-stage funding agencies and industry.
