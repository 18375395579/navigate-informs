<br>Title: Creating New Enterprises as a Structured Design Problem</br><br>Author: Karl Ulrich, Professor, The Wharton School, 500 Huntsman Hall, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, ulrich@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Enterprises can be represented by a template or grammar using standard primitives (e.g., products, customers, transactions). By representing enterprises this way, a search space of new ventures can be made explicit and structured design methods can be used to explore this space. This framework, with its roots in Simon's Sciences of the Artificial offers the potential for a rigorous theoretical foundation to the enterprise creation process in the fields of entrepreneurship and innovation.</br>
