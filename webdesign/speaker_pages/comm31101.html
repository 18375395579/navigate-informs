<br>Title: Evidence of Biases in the Adoption of Energy Efficiency Initiatives by Small and Medium Sized Firms</br><br>Author: Suresh Muthulingam, UCLA, suresh.muthulingam.2010@anderson.ucla.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Charles Corbett</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the adoption of energy efficiency initiatives using a database of over 100,000 recommendations provided to small and medium sized firms. We find that adoption of a recommendation depends not only on its characteristics but also on how it is presented. Adoption rates are higher for those initiatives appearing early on in a list of recommendations. Adoption is also not influenced by the number of options provided to decision makers, contrary to theoretical predictions.</br>
