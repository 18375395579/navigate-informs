Subjects offered $5, $10 or $15 gift cards were more likely to donate blood and more so for higher reward values. The rewards also led to social spillovers, spatial displacement and short-term shifts in donation timing, but no long-term effects. Effects were stronger for subjects with lower donation costs and less reputational concerns.</br>
