Title: Short-term, Long-term, Social and Spatial Effects of Rewards for Blood Donation: A Field Experiment<br>Author: Mario Macis, Assistant Professor, Johns Hopkins University, 100 International Dr, Baltimore, MD, United States of America, mmacis@jhu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Slonim, Nicola Lacetera<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In a natural field experiment with the American Red Cross we studied the total effects of incentives on pro-social behavior. Subjects offered $5, $10 or $15 gift cards were more likely to donate blood and more so for higher reward values. The rewards also led to social spillovers, spatial displacement and short-term shifts in donation timing, but no long-term effects. Effects were stronger for subjects with lower donation costs and less reputational concerns.
