Greve, Anup Walvekar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine the sources of time wasting in professional football (soccer). Although purposely delaying the game is illegal, it is a potential strategic behavior that players in specific positions (e.g., goalkeeper) or entire teams may engage in when it increases the chances of a favorable match outcome. We test heuristic rules for when players might waste time in re-starting the play after a stoppage, along with analytical rules based on the estimated arrival rates of goals for both teams. We find evidence of systematic and strategic time wasting across many player behaviors. The evidence supports a reconsideration of the current time-keeping rules in the game of football.
