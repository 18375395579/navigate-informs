<br>Title: An Open-architecture GIS Component for Creating Multiband Traffic Density Maps</br><br>Author: David Hunt, Oliver Wyman, One University Square, Suite 100, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, David.Hunt@oliverwyman.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We will present the architecture behind a GIS mapping component, which was built to generate multiband traffic density maps.  Utilizing a web-based, open-architecture design allows this component to be called from nearly any software system that can provide a traffic file and access to a network.</br>
