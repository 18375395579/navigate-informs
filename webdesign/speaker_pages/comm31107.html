<br>Title: Aggregating Inconsistent Information: Ranking and Clustering</br><br>Author: Nir Ailon, Institute for Advanced Study, School of Mathematics, Einstein Drive, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States, nir.ailon@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Moses Charikar, Alantha Newman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A ranking of web pages is to be computed from outputs of several search engines. A clustering of microarray data is to be computed from outputs of several clustering heuristics. More generally: How do we combine possibly contradicting information from different sources? These questions are in the intersection of combinatorial optimization and social choice theory. I will survey recent work related to their computational aspects and present new and improved approximation algorithms.</br>
