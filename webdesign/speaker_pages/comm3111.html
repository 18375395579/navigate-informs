Recognizing the diverse and evolving nature of cyber attack, this work develops multiple algorithms requiring minimal a priori information. Specifically, algorithms exploring the attacker’s capability, opportunity, and behavior trends will be presented. Promising results suggest the validity and future directions in proactive cyber defense.</br>
