Title: Security Games: Challenges in Modeling Human Adversarial Behavior<br>Author: Milind Tambe, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, tambe@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rong Yang, James Pita<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Stackelberg security games have received significant attentions in recent years given their deployment for real-world security problems. Many of these real-world systems have adopted the standard game-theoretic assumption that the adversaries are perfectly rational; this assumption may not hold when facing human adversary with bounded rationality. We provide an overview of our research efforts to address human bounded rationality in the context of security games.
