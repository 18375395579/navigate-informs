We show, counter-intuitively, that firms?investments in accessibility can be socially inefficient. Increasing accessibility benefits patients, but manufacturers invest excessively in this to minimize the risk of stockouts. This makes it difficult to efficiently allocate vaccines during shortages. We study different ways to address this problem.</br>
