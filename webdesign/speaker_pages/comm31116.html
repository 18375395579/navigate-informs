In the late 1970s Dick Chase published articles espousing an operational delineation of services. In 2004, articles came out refuting long-held marketing perspectives on services, authored by marketing professors themselves. A 2007 empirical study showed that the most valid service basis was the model presented by Chase in 1978. Where does this leave our understanding today?</br>
