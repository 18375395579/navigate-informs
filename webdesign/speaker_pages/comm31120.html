Title: Conformity and Decoupling in the Face of Pluralism:  Theoretical Lessons Inspired by Stories of Compliance and Defiance of the Church in the Rwandan Genocide<br>Author: Emily Block, University of Notre Dame, Mendoza College of Business, Notre Dame, IN, United States of America, eblock1@nd.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A key challenge for institutional theory has been the systematic understanding of conformity and deviance.  This quest has been further complicated by recent work calling for a more comprehensive picture of the complexity that comes with pluralistic institutional environments.  In this research we consider the conditions under which actors in a pluralistic institutional environment will join the majority and conform to institutionally driven behaviors and the conditions under which actors are likely to deviate and defy institutionally prescribed behavior.  In order to illustrate this theorizing we draw from stories that emerge from the study of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide and in particular the role of the Church during that time period.
