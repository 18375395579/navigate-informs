<br>Title: The GAMS Grid Computing Facility</br><br>Author: Alexander Meeraus, GAMS Development Corporation, 1217 Potomac Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20007, United States, AMeeraus@gams.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: As multiple CPUs and High Performance Computing Grids are becoming available more widely, the GAMS language has been extended to take advantage of these new environments. New language features facilitates the management of asynchronous submission and collection of model solution tasks in a platform independent fashion. A simple architecture, relying on existing operating systems functionality allows for rapid introduction of new environments and provides for an open research architecture.</br>
