Title: The Operational Readiness Level Metric for Technology Development<br>Author: Kenneth Donovan, Lockheed Martin Fellow, Lockheed Martin, 1801 State Route 17C, MD 0532, Owego, NY, 13827, United States of America, ken.b.donovan@lmco.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Operational Readiness Level (ORL) is a proposed metric for assessing the operational maturity of a technology during the development cycle. ORL addresses a limitation of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) metric that measures the technical maturity of an item, rather than the operational use. ORL requires early verification of the operational usage of a technology solution, thereby guiding technology development to produce items that benefit the user.
