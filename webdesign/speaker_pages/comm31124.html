Title: Examining Various Tournament Selection Strategies for Spatially Constrained Forest Planning Problems<br>Author: Matthew Thompson, Graduate Student, Department of Forest Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, matthew.thompson@oregonstate.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Most forest planning implementations of Genetic Algorithms have used some form of proportional or ranking-based selection.  Use of tournament selection may accelerate the process of evolution and could be a promising strategy for difficult forest planning problems.  This research will examine the impact on solution time and quality from using deterministic and stochastic tournament selection strategies for spatially constrained forest planning.
