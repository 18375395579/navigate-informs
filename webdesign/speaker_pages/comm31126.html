Identifying the inputs that most impact the system can be a critical step. Here, we introduce a new, simple method for identifying active factors in Gaussian process models for computer screening experiments. The posterior distribution of an inert factor is used as a reference distribution against which the importance of true experimental factors can be assessed.</br>
