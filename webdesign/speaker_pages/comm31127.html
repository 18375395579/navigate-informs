<br>Title: Reducing Costly Information Acquisition in Auctions</br><br>Author: Kate Larson, University of Waterloo, Computer Science Department, klarson@cs.uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Most auction research assumes that potential bidders have private information about their willingness to pay for an item.

Recent attempts at modeling this phenomena has brought to light complex strategic behavior arising from information-gathering, and has shown that traditional approaches to auction and mechanism design are not able to overcome it.</br>
