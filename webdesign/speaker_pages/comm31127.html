Title: Reducing Costly Information Acquisition in Auctions<br>Author: Kate Larson, University of Waterloo, Computer Science Department, klarson@cs.uwaterloo.ca<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Most auction research assumes that potential bidders have private information about their willingness to pay for an item.  In reality, bidders often have to go through a costly information-gathering process in order to learn their valuations. Recent attempts at modeling this phenomena has brought to light complex strategic behavior arising from information-gathering, and has shown that traditional approaches to auction and mechanism design are not able to overcome it.
