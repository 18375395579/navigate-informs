Title: Balancing Investment in FQHCs and Medicaid for Improved Access and Coverage<br>Author: Paul Griffin, Professor and Head, Pennsylvania State University, Dept. of Industrial Engineering, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, pmg14@engr.psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyunji Lee, Christina Scherrer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The objective of this study is to find a balanced investment between CHC expansion and relaxing Medicaid eligibility to improve both access and coverage. The comparison is achieved by integrating mathematical models with several data sets that allow for specific estimations of healthcare need. We use the state of Pennsylvania as a test case. Our results have implications for policymakers on how increasing access or increasing coverage affect primary care.
