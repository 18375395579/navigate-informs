Title: Quantifying Two Effects of the Crowds: Size of the Crowd and Individual Contributions<br>Author: David Budescu, Professor of Psychology, Fordham University, 441 East Fordham Road, Dealy Hall, Bronx, NY, 10458, United States of America, budescu@fordham.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eva Chen, James Marcus<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present new methods designed to measure meaningfully the effects observed in the process of aggregating probabilistic forecasts from multiple judges (the ``wisdom of the crowd'').  We derive measures of the size of the crowd and the contributions of the various individuals to the crowd. We illustrate them by analyzing responses from the Aggregative Contingent Estimation System (ACES), a forecasting website in which over 2000 judges have provided forecasts for more than 200 events.
