Title: Combining Judgments with Evidence from Multiple Research Programs<br>Author: Stephen Hora, Professor, University of Southern California, 3710 McClintock Ave., Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, hora@price.usc.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Risks from radiation exposures during mammography and from failure to detect malignancies must be balanced.  Recent evidence has shown that a dose of radiation with a lower energy level may be more destructive than the same dose at a higher energy level.  Data from epidemiology, animal, DNA, microdosimetry, and cellular radiobiology studies are used to assess the impact of different energy levels on the target human tissue.
