Recent evidence has shown that a dose of radiation with a lower energy level may be more destructive than the same dose at a higher energy level.  Data from epidemiology, animal, DNA, microdosimetry, and cellular radiobiology studies are used to assess the impact of different energy levels on the target human tissue.</br>
