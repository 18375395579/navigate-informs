To anticipate the demand for manpower specialties, we need to capture country-centric health care requirements using standard health statistical indicators. The majority of the need is focused on prevention of infectious diseases such as TB, malaria, and yellow fever.  Once a medical manpower workload is established, delivery can be discussed among NGOs, volunteer organizations and military medical personnel.</br>
