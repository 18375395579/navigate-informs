<br>Title: Sequencing Patients in a Surgical Day-care Center: A Software Application</br><br>Author: Brecht Cardoen, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven - Faculty of Business and Economics, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, BE-3000, Belgium, Brecht.Cardoen@econ.kuleuven.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erik Demeulemeester</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present an application that visualizes the impact of patient sequencing on the availability of critical resources, such as recovery beds or medical instruments. The tool also incorporates diverse integer programming algorithms to optimize a multi-objective function, which includes amongst other the leveling of the recovery's bed occupation. Next to the development phase of the software application, we discuss both its implementation in a Belgian hospital and the resulting contributions.</br>
