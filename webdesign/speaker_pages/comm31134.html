Previous studies reported that CCR could improve health outcomes, but had limited effect on changing physicians' behavior. In order to study clinicians' adherence to CCR, we conducted a survey instrument to measure users' demographics and attitudes toward CCR. Logistic regression was applied to identify and model the prognostic predictors affecting users' adherence to CCR.</br>
