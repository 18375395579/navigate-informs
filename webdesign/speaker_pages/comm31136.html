An Empirical Study of ICU Performance</br><br>Author: Diwas Kc, PhD Candidate, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut St., Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, diwas@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We find that the discharge decision in a cardiac ICU is not only medical, but also operational. A capacity constrained ICU discharges patients early and this decision has eventual capacity and quality implications. In some cases, an early discharged patient develops further complications leading to a longer ICU revisit. In this paper, we explore the quality-capacity tradeoff to determine if a hospital should “do it right the first time?or “revisit and rework.?</br>
