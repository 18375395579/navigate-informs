Title: Isolating the Effects of Health IT on Performance: Empirical Test of Complementarities and Learning<br>Author: Ritu Agarwal, University of Maryland, ragarwal@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Corey Angst<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine HIT adoption and process-level value, incorporating the effects of learning that occurs through complementarities.  We use a dataset of HIT adopted by almost 400 nationally-representative hospitals in the US, matched with quality and financial performance data to examine a specialty IT application related to cardio care.  Results show that when a temporal learning component is introduced into the model as a complementary effect, the IT-Performance link becomes stronger.
