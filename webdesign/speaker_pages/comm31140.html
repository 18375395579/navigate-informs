Title: The Effect of Focus Across the Service Portfolio of Acute Hospitals<br>Author: Stefan Scholtes, Professor, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, United Kingdom, s.scholtes@jbs.cam.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Sandra Sülz, Ludwig Kuntz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Acute hospitals are legally obliged to provide services across a spectrum of acute conditions. In contrast to manufacturing firms, they cannot narrow this portfolio when they decide to focus on specific services. This raises the question whether non-focus services suffer when hospitals focus on some services or whether certain types of focus services can pull up non-focus services as well? We investigate these questions empirically with a multi-hospital dataset from Germany.
