Title: Cut Generator for Chvatal-Gomory Rank 1 Inequalities<br>Author: Brady Hunsaker, Assistant Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1036 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, hunsaker@engr.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Baz, Craig Tovey<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present code submitted to the COIN-OR Cut Generator Library (CGL) for Chvatal Gomory rank 1 inequalities.  Separation of these inequalities requires the solution of a MIP and has been explored by several researchers.  We discuss the formulation used to separate the inequalities, user interface and parameters, and possible applications.  We also discuss the potential use of this code as a model for other MIP-based CGL routines.
