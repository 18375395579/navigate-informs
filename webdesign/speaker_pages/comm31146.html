<br>Title: Acro: A Common Respository for Optimizers</br><br>Author: William Hart, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800, MS 1318, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States of America, wehart@sandia.gov</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We describe Acro, a collection of optimization-related software libraries. The Acro Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development, integration and support of optimization software libraries. Acro includes both individual optimization solvers as well as optimization frameworks that provide abstract interfaces for flexible interoperability of solver components. We will survey the capabilities of Acro and compare it to the COIN-OR software effort.</br>
