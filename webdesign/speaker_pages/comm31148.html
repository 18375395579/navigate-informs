<br>Title: Decision Bias in the Sequential Search for the Best Alternative: A Laboratory Investigation</br><br>Author: David Hall, PhD Candidate, Clemson University, 113 Daniel Ave, Seneca, SC, 29678, United States of America, dchall@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gulru Ozkan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: How to optimally and sequentially search for the best alternative has been examined extensively in the extant New Product Development literature.
