Title: Decision Bias in the Sequential Search for the Best Alternative: A Laboratory Investigation<br>Author: David Hall, PhD Candidate, Clemson University, 113 Daniel Ave, Seneca, SC, 29678, United States of America, dchall@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gulru Ozkan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: How to optimally and sequentially search for the best alternative has been examined extensively in the extant New Product Development literature. The optimal search policy is to develop products with the highest net present value, often requiring radical innovation. Yet to the contrary, anecdotal evidence suggests that incremental innovation may be preferred. With this in mind, we ask: Do agent’s decision biases cause them to develop incremental products at the expense of radical products?
