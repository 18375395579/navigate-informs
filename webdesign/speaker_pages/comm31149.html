However, blood screening tests are imperfectly reliable and prevalence rates are uncertain. The budget-constrained decision-maker needs to select a set of screening tests so as to minimize the infection risk in the blood pool. We analyze structural properties of an optimal solution and perform a case study using real data.</br>
