<br>Title: A New Methodology for Investigating Health Disparities</br><br>Author: Chester Spell, Associate Professor, Rutgers University Camden, School of Business, 227 Penn Street, Rm 331, Camden, NJ, 08102-1656, United States of America, cspell@camden.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Katerina Bezrukova, Alok Baveja</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A challenge in understanding disparities in health between communities is evaluating the effect of multiple disparity-related factors  (e.g., disease incidence, location, access to care).  Using the emerging concept of macro-faultlines, or alignment of characteristics that individuals within a population share, we develop an innovative method that assesses 'total health disparity.? The goal is to address community-based disparities and preventive-health strategies in a more informed manner.</br>
