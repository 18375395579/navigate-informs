Title: Algorithms for DEA with Streaming Data<br>Author: Jose Dula, Virginia Commonweatlth University, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA, United States of America, jdula@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francisco Lopez<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Abstract: A challenge for DEA arises when data stream in quickly and the analysis needs to keep up. The relevant performance measure becomes the processing rate. This will determine the types of applications for this extension of DEA. Although computers and LP solvers play a major role in this, it is new algorithms that will permit real extensions of the performance limits. We explore algorithms especially developed for DEA with streaming data and report on their performance.
