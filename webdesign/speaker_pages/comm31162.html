<br>Title: The Effect of Alignment of Product Architecture and Organization Structure on Product Performance</br><br>Author: Jin-Kyu Park, Assitant Professor, Florida International University, Industrial & Systems Engineering, 10555 West Flagler St. / EC 3100, Miami, FL, 33174, United States of America, kyupark@fiu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sebastian Fixson</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research is to test the hypotheses that product architecture and firm boundary are highly interrelated and that their joint effect plays a critical role for product performance.  We use a distinctive measurement of product architecture and unique research setting: the U.S. bicycle component industry from 1980 to 1992, to test the hypotheses.  This study shows that only when product architecture changed from modular to integral, organizational structure is critical for product performance.</br>
