Title: Behavior-consistent Information-based Network Traffic Control for Evacuation Operations<br>Author: Yu-Ting Hsu, Purdue University, 3000 Kent Ave., Nextrans Center, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, yhsu@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose an information-based control module to determine route guidance for evacuation traffic management. It seeks to incorporate realism by factoring likely evacuee response in the determination of route guidance, to seek consistency between evacuee behavior and the control objective. Numerical experiments are conducted; they highlight the importance of considering behavior-consistency and indicate the limits of implementing linguistic route guidance in real-world evacuation operations.
