It seeks to incorporate realism by factoring likely evacuee response in the determination of route guidance, to seek consistency between evacuee behavior and the control objective. Numerical experiments are conducted; they highlight the importance of considering behavior-consistency and indicate the limits of implementing linguistic route guidance in real-world evacuation operations.</br>
