Title: Branching in SCIP<br>Author: Gerald Gamrath, Research Assistant, Zuse-Institut Berlin, Takustr 7, Berlin, 14199, Germany, gamrath@zib.de<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Deciding how to branch is one of the most important decisions any branch-and-bound based MIP solver has to take. In this talk, we discuss the so-called “hybrid branching?scheme, which combines the well-known concepts of strong-branching and pseudo-costs with more general criteria like conflicts and inferences originating from the SAT and CP context.  Regarding a current example, we discuss drawbacks of current methods and present recent experiments concerning an extended strong branching.
