Title: A Result Language  (OSrL) and Solver Option Language (OSoL) for Distributed Optimization<br>Author: Kipp Martin, Professor, University of Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States, kipp.martin@chicagogsb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Fourer, Jun Ma<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present an XML-based result language (OSrL) and an XML-based solver option language (OSoL) for distributed optimization systems. We also describe associated in-memory objectes OSResult and OSOption that are used in a library to support client-solver communication in a system based on Web Services.
