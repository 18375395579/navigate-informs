Returns policies help to stimulate demand by insuring consumers against potential product misfit.  However, this increases the chances that firms will be left with excess stock when unwanted items are returned.  We develop an integrated model to address consumers' purchase and keep-or-return decisions, as well as firms' operational decisions.</br>
