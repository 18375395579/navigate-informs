Rau, Instructor of History, Department of History and Politics, Drexel University, MacAlister Hall 3025, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, erau@drexel.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper argues that the arrival in the United States in 1942 marks a broader attempt by civilian scientists, military officers, and other professionals to institute a coherent technology policy during World War II. Victory in war vindicated the general consensus on government-industry-university coordination (despite deep disagreements over its implementation), thereby paving the road for OR’s postwar career as a tool in science and technology policy making.</br>
