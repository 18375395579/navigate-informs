<br>Title: Mathematical Programming Methods for the Optimization of the Emergency Health-care Service in Milan</br><br>Author: Giovanni Righini, University of Milan, Via Bramante 65, Crema, CR, Italy, righini@dti.unimi.it</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marco Trubian, Roberto Cordone, Alberto Ceselli, Andrea Pinciroli</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we will present a case study we have done for the emergency health care service in the city of Milan.  The main subproblem concerns real-time relocation of available ambulances. Related subproblems concern the choice of the parking areas for the ambulances, the trade-off between the level of service provided to non-urgent calls and the probability of not responding to urgent calls in time, service cost minimization and night duties scheduling of heart surgery wards.</br>
