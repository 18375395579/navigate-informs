Title: Deployment Concerns and Battle Management Scheduling of Unmanned Aerial Systems<br>Author: Jeffrey Schvey, Raytheon, 235 Presidential Way, Woburn, MA, 01801, United States of America, Jeffrey_E_Schvey@raytheon.com<br>Coauthor(s): George Blaha<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present an overview of operations studies using a decentralized network of airborne sensors to provide missile defense engagement support.  We consider deployment concerns such as basing logistics and target area coverage, as well as sensor resource scheduling during engagements to maximize system effectiveness.  Results for various deployment strategies and sensor scheduling techniques are shown.
