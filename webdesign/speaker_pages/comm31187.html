Title: Social Media and Its Future in the Army<br>Author: Evan Szablowski, United States Military Academy, Department of Mathematics, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, evanszab@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Kathryn Coronges, Chris Arney, Hilary Fletcher<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Social Media (SM) have taken a central role in transforming the way people communicate and how we think about social engagement.  Young generations have grown up enmeshed in SM, producing expectations about access to information. Young soldiers expect the military to be at the frontier of this revolution.   We analyze how younger generations use SM and show how the military can benefit by applying the similar concepts to communication.
