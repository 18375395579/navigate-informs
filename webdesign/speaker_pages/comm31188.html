Title: Simulation-Based Commissioning of Factory Control Systems<br>Author: Jeffrey Smith, Professor, Auburn University, 207 Dunstan Hall, Auburn, AL, 36849, United States, jsmith@auburn.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Commissioning involves proving/demonstrating that a control system works as designed, intended and contracted. For complex factory control systems, commissioning is a time-consuming and expensive process. However, the commissioning process is critical from the contractual, performance, and safety points of view. This presentation discusses the opportunities for applying discrete-event simulation technology to the general factory control system commissioning process.
