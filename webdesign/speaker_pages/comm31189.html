We provide insights on the impact of RVI on panel size, emergency visits and patient health. We also evaluate the value of remote patient monitoring with which the physician receives informative signals from the patient such as blood pressure, weight, etc. between patient visits. We show that utilizing these signals can help the physician increase his panel size and quality of care.</br>
