Title: Is Overbidding in Online Auctions the Result of a Pseudo-Endowment Effect?<br>Author: James R. Wolf, Fisher College of Business, Ohio State University, 400 Fisher Hall, 2100 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, wolf.206@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hal R. Arkes, Waleed A. Muhanna<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Possession of an item increases an owner's valuation of it; a phenomenon termed the endowment effect. We hypothesize that temporarily being the high bidder during an auction may induce a related  pseudo-endowment effect. To test this, we examine eBay bid data and conduct a variation of the classic mug experiment.
