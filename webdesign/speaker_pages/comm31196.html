It assesses the risk of asset loss, studies business processes, and identifies opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper, we apply AHP and DEA to determine the business units that need audit.  The framework is comprehensive, flexible, and shows great potential for internal audit prioritization and resource allocation.</br>
