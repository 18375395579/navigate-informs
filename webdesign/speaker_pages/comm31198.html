Title: Double Oracle Algorithms for Game-Theoretic Resource Allocation<br>Author: Milind Tambe, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, tambe@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Manish Jain, Jason Tsai<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many strategic actions carry a component beyond the immediate locale of the effort itself. To address the exponentially large strategy spaces that result, the RUGGED algorithm for road network domains uses best-response oracles and scales to real road networks of southern Mumbai. However, when contagion is present, computing best-responses is intractable. Thus, we extend RUGGED using heuristic oracles that enable it to scale to realistically sized leadership networks from counterinsurgency.
