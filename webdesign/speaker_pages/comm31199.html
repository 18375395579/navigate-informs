Title: Kidney Exchange: Present and Future<br>Author: Tuomas Sandholm, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, United States of America, sandholm@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Dickerson, Ariel Procaccia<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: I will share my experiences in designing and developing the algorithms for the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange.  I will discuss the main challenges facing kidney exchanges, focusing on the two key dynamics: 1) various natural failures that cause most matches not to go to transplant, and 2) entry and exit of pairs and altruists.  I will discuss results from several of our recent papers that tackle optimization under these dynamics.
