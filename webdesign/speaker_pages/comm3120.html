Hardy Dr., #2095, Tempe, AZ, 85282, United States of America, bargera@bgu.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Boyce</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Traffic assignments continuously pose computing challenges, from the 1950's, as the main civilian application of the first computers, until today, when larger complex models fully utilize available computing capacities. Recently, improved convergence needed for refined scenario analyses became available. The future challenge of plausible route flows will also be discussed.</br>
