Title: Comparisons of State-of-the-art Linear Math Programming Software<br>Author: William Hart, Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 1318, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States, wehart@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Paul Watson, Cynthia Phillips<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This session will include presentations that compare the performance of math programming solvers for integer programming: 1) Linear programming solvers, 2) MILP incubment generators, 3) MILP solvers with an optimal incumbent value, and 4) MILP solvers with no incumbent. We will also discuss experimental techniques for making comparisons. These comparisons will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of open source solvers, and assess how well they compare to commercial solvers.
