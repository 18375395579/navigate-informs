Severe ADRs are estimated to cause over 100,000 fatalities in the US each year. This study examines the use of retrospective medication orders and inpatient laboratory results documented in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to identify ADRs. It correlated abnormal laboratory results with specific drug administrations by comparing the outcomes of a drug-exposed group and a matched unexposed group.</br>
