<br>Title: When Does the Devil Make Work? An Empirical Study of the Impact of Workload on Server's Performance</br><br>Author: Serguei Netessine, Professor, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fountainbleau, 77305, France, Serguei.Netessine@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fangyun Tan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a large, detailed operational data set from a restaurant chain to shed new light on how workload. We find that when the overall workload is low, an increase in the workload leads to higher server performance. However, there is a saturation point after which any further increase in the workload leads to degradation of performance.</br>
