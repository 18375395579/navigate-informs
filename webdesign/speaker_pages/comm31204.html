<br>Title: A Tale of Two Countries: Trust and Trustworthiness in China and the U.S.</br><br>Author: Yanchong Karen Zheng, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 100 Main Street, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, yanchong@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozalp Ozer, Yufei Ren</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We experimentally investigate how cultural distinctions between China and the U.S. affect the efficacy of forecast sharing in a supply chain. We demonstrate that trust and trustworthiness are lower and decline more evidently with increasing risks in China. In addition, repeated interactions lead to reversed dynamics for the evolution of trust and trustworthiness in the two countries.</br>
