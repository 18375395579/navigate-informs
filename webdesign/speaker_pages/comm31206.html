<br>Title: Does ISO 9000 Reduce Quality Risk?  A Longitudinal Study</br><br>Author: John Gray, Assistant Professor, Ohio State University, Fisher College of Business, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, gray.402@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aleda Roth, Enno Siemsen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: ISO 9000 certification is often considered a proxy for strong quality capability.  However, empirical support for the effect of ISO 9000 on quality performance has been mixed.  In this research, we use multiple years of Food and Drug Administration inspection data to determine if, in fact, ISO 9000 reduces quality risk.  We assess quality risk before, during and after ISO 9000 certification on a sample of firms in the medical device industry.</br>
