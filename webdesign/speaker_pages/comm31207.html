We apply binomial regression on proprietary archival data where we establish a relationship between product returns and a number of factors that are believed to cause expiration. Our framework of analysis allows companies to identify the main drivers of product expiration in their supply chain, understand their relative impact, and estimate the benefits of possible initiatives to reduce expiration.</br>
