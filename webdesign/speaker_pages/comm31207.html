Title: Drivers of Unsaleables in Retail Supply Chains<br>Author: Arzum Akkas, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, arzumakkas@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper analyses the drivers of product expiration in the consumer packaged goods industry. We apply binomial regression on proprietary archival data where we establish a relationship between product returns and a number of factors that are believed to cause expiration. Our framework of analysis allows companies to identify the main drivers of product expiration in their supply chain, understand their relative impact, and estimate the benefits of possible initiatives to reduce expiration.
