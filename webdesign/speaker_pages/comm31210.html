Title: Pickup and Delivery with Split Loads<br>Author: Maciek Nowak, mnowak@georgiasouthern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Özlem Ergun, Chip White<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Splitting a load such that the delivery of that load may be completed by multiple vehicles results in numerous opportunities for cost reduction.  We present an upper bound on this cost reduction.  We also discuss the problem characteristics that allow for the most benefit and those market sectors that may find split loads to be most useful.
