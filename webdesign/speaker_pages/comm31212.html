Title: Interdependent Impacts in Infrastructure Resilience Modeling<br>Author: Hiba Baroud, PhD Student, University of Oklahoma, 202 West Boyd St, Rm. 124, Norman, OK, 73019, United States of America, hbaroud@ou.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kash Barker, Jose Emmanuel Ramirez-Marquez, Claudio Rocco<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A resilience modeling approach is developed with a focus on the inherent costs of a disruptive event. This work integrates the quantitative resilience approach with a model describing the regional, multi-industry impacts of a disruptive event, thereby measuring the positive impact of resilience. A case study of an inland waterway transportation network, the Mississippi River Navigation System, illustrates the approach discussed.
