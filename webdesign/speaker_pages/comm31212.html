This work integrates the quantitative resilience approach with a model describing the regional, multi-industry impacts of a disruptive event, thereby measuring the positive impact of resilience. A case study of an inland waterway transportation network, the Mississippi River Navigation System, illustrates the approach discussed.</br>
