<br>Title: A Location Model of an Eyeglass Lens Adjustment Problem</br><br>Author: Richard Francis, Professor Emeritus, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, francis@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The problem is to find one (or several) best eyeglass lens adjustment(s) for an eye with double vision when the vision changes throughout the day.  We model the problem as a well-known location problem, and mention some personal experience.  Known theoretical results have some interesting applications, believed to be new.</br>
