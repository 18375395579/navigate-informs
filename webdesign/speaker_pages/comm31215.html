Consumer’s perception of its value depends on social capital in the network. If consumers appreciate the value, they will pay more attention to service continuity and recover soon after abnormal status occurs. Using telecom service data, we examine the role of social capital. The results indicate that network structural properties and reciprocal social norm have significant impact on consumer’s attention to service continuity in social network.
