<br>Title: Dynamic Risk Management for Real-Time Decision Support of Network Centric Systems</br><br>Author: Paul West, Assistant Professor, United States Military Academy, Department of Systems Engineering, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, paul.west@usma.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The emergence of network-centric systems of knowledgeable, autonomous, yet interdependent nodes has created unique problems for decision makers, especially in a military environment that is complex, dynamic, and characterized by uncertainty, ambiguity, and friction. This paper explores multi-attribute decision analysis methods for managing NCS in an asymmetric competitive environment and presents a real-time, values-oriented decision support system for NCS based on risk management techniques.</br>
