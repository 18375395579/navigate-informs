We reviewed systematically experimental social-psychology studies to explore what a leader can do when working with stakeholders lacking interest in learning management science but expressing opinions about decisions, nonetheless. Leaders will find the most success if they do not bring operational decisions to groups but instead act autocratically while obtaining needed information in 1:1 conversations.
