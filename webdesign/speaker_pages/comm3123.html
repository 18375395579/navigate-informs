Title: BLOSSOMS:  Blended Learning Open Source Science Or Math Studies<br>Author: Richard Larson, MIT, E40-231, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, rclarson@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Elizabeth Murray<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: BLOSSOMS is a new educational initiative to co-create with international partners an OER (Open Educational Resource) repository of interactive video modules for science and mathematics classes to enhance high school education worldwide.  With the in-class teacher integral to the pedagogy, we wish to encourage critical thinking skills and move away from rewarding rote memorization and to excite young women and men to stay with math and science.  Here we show how INFORMS members can contribute.
