Building on modular systems theory, we theorize how their mutual alignment helps sustain IT alignment by increasing IT agility. Empirical tests of a firm-level type-II moderated-mediation model using data from 223 organizations support these ideas, contributing insights into how IT architecture modularity complements IT governance choices.</br>
