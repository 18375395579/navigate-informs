Title: Fit Between IT Architecture Modularity and IT Governance Design<br>Author: Amrit Tiwana, College of Business, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, tiwana@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Benn R. Konsynski<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We conceptualize the theoretically-neglected interactions between organizational IT architecture modularity and IT governance design in shaping IT alignment. Building on modular systems theory, we theorize how their mutual alignment helps sustain IT alignment by increasing IT agility. Empirical tests of a firm-level type-II moderated-mediation model using data from 223 organizations support these ideas, contributing insights into how IT architecture modularity complements IT governance choices.
