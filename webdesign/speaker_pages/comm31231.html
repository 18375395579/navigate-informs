Title: Risk Premia and Optimal Liquidation of Defaultable Securities<br>Author: Tim Siu-Tang Leung, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, leung@ieor.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peng Liu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the optimal timing to liquidate defaultable securities in a general intensity-based credit risk model under stochastic interest rate. The model incorporates the potential price discrepancy between the market and investors under different default risk premia specifications. We introduce the delayed liquidation premium and analyze the optimal liquidation policy for various credit derivatives.
