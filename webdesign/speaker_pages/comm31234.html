Title: Heavy-tails in Natural and Man-made Disasters<br>Author: David Alderson, Assistant Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Department, 1411 Cunningham Rd, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, dlalders@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean Carlson, John Doyle<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Over the last century, natural and man-made disaster events have been heavy-tailed in the number of people killed and the amount of damage caused.  Focusing on earthquakes, forest fires, and hurricanes, we demonstrate features that contradict recently popular notions of universal self-organization for large-scale disasters.  Understanding this structure and the mechanisms which yield it is a prerequisite for policy makers to properly incorporate this intrinsic variability in disaster planning.
