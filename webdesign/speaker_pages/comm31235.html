Title: Estimating Human Resource Needs to Achieve Universal Anti-retroviral Treatment Coverage for HIV/AIDS<br>Author: Salal Humair, Research Scientist, Harvard School of Public Health, 665 Huntington Avenue, Building 1, Room 1102, Boston, MA, 02115, United States of America, shumair@hsph.harvard.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Till Barnighausen, David Bloom<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage remains a central but distant goal of global HIV efforts, even after a decade of remarkable expansion in ART programs. A fundamental challenge associated with this goal involves putting in place the necessary human resources. We formulate a model to estimate the human resource needs accounting for both the mortality reduction and prevention effects of ART. We discuss the policy implications of our results.
