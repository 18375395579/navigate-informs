Title: Centralized Topology Control and Enhanced Distribution Network LMPs for T&D Resilience<br>Author: Michael Caramanis, Professor, Boston University, Division of Systems Engineering, 15 Saint Mary's Street, Brookline, MA, 02446, United States of America, Mcaraman@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pablo Ruiz, Justin Foster<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: T&D infrastructure resilience is a key objective of efforts for the triple sustainability -- environmental, economic and energy security ?of massive clean energy generation integration. We will outline new directions towards this end encompassing (i) practical Dynamic Transmission Network Reconfiguration and (ii) expanded Distribution Network Locational Marginal Cost-based Pricing.
