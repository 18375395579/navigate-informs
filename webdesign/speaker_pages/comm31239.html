This concern is driven by the increase in broadband Internet penetration and the development of networking systems, notably the BitTorrent protocol. In our research we analyze the lifecycle of demand for piracy across movies and across countries. Our analysis helps us to evaluate the degree to which piracy serves as a complement or substitute to legitimate demand, and the optimal movie release strategies across international markets.</br>
