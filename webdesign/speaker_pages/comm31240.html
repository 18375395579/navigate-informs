<br>Title: Shake it up Baby: Scheduling with Package Auctions</br><br>Author: Kan Takeuchi, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, Department of Economics, 611 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yan Chen, John Lin, Thomas Finholt</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling the use of scientific equipments when there is synergy among contiguous time slots. The environment is based on the resource allocation problem faced by the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). In this environment, we evaluate three mechanisms in the laboratory, RAD (Kwasnica et al, 2005), generalized Vickrey auction, and a knapsack ranking mechanism which is a best-case representation of current scientific equipment time allocation methods. We find that, while the RAD and Vickrey mechanism produces higher efficiency than knapsack, the Vickrey and knapsack mechanisms achieve higher equity level among participants than RAD.</br>
