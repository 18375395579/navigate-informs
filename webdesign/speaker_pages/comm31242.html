<br>Title: Who Have Incentives to Expand the Power Transmission Systems?</br><br>Author: Enzo Sauma, Dr., Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicuña Mackenna 4860, Santiago, RM, Chile, esauma@ing.puc.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we study the economic-incentive structures for long-term transmission investment that currently exist in the United States. In particular, we analyze the incentives/disincentives that some specific market participants (holders of transmission rights, merchant investors, and generation firms) have to make socially efficient transmission expansions. We also propose some variations to the actual incentive structures that could improve efficiency from a social-welfare perspective.</br>
