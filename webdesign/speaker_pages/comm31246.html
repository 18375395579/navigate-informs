<br>Title: Monitoring a Dynamic Network</br><br>Author: Bahareh Azarnoush, Student, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, bazarnou@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Runger, Jennifer Bekki, Kamran Paynabar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Networks can naturally model many real world phenomena.
