Title: Vietnam Veteran Mortality<br>Author: Matthew S. Brooks, Texas State University, 601 University Drive, San Marcos, TX, 78666, United States of America, mb96@txstate.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Increased early mortality in Vietnam Veterans is going unnoticed and deserves analysis. Examine veteran deaths in the Social Security Administration Death File. The Vietnam Veteran is seeing a significantly different distribution of deaths than the population. A simple graphical comparison illustrates that the majority of Vietnam Veterans who died were younger (mode 50-55) vs. the population (mode of 75 or greater).  All cause mortality among the Vietnam Veteran cohort is higher than expected.
