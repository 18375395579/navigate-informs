Title: An Economic Evaluation of Opioid Addiction Treatment Services in British Columbia<br>Author: Bohdan Nosyk, Health Economist, Centre for Health Evaluation and Outcome Sciences, Vancouver, BC, Canada, bnosyk@hivnet.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Aslam Anis<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Opioid addiction carries a substantial economic burden, and treatment options currently available are few.  Experimental studies on new forms of treatment raise the question of how health and economic outcomes would be affected at the population level, if they were to be implemented.  We evaluate this potential impact through a model constructed to simulate current addict populations and treatment conditions in British Columbia, Canada.
