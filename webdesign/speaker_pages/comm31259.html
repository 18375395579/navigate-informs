Title: Using Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization to Inform New Military Vehicle Design<br>Author: Liliana Shelton, Systems Analyst, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800-1188, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States of America, lshelto@sandia.gov<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Given the stringent fiscal environment surrounding defense acquisition coupled with the need to maintain and improve military capabilities, it is extremely important to obtain greater efficiency in defense spending.  To address this issue, we employ a Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization approach that meticulously explores multitudes of possible design decisions to map out the complex trade space that exists between requirement satisfaction, performance, cost, and schedule.
