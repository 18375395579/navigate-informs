Box 162993, Orlando, FL, 32816, United States of America, halukakin@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jos?Sepúlveda<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Open source software is emerging as an important part of Today’s software world. Availability of free software creates equal access opportunity independent of available funds in many academic fields. In this paper we will compare performances of three optimization software, COIN-OR (open source), LPSOLVE (open source) and CPLEX (commercial). We will use five highly cited multi-dimensional knapsack problem sets as test beds. We will compare the solution times and the best solutions found.
