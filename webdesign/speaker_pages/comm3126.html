Availability of free software creates equal access opportunity independent of available funds in many academic fields. In this paper we will compare performances of three optimization software, COIN-OR (open source), LPSOLVE (open source) and CPLEX (commercial). We will use five highly cited multi-dimensional knapsack problem sets as test beds. We will compare the solution times and the best solutions found.</br>
