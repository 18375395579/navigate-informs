<br>Title: Input for Modeling Hospital Emergency Response: Medical Personnel Availability</br><br>Author: Anke Richter, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Defense Resources Management Institute, 699 Dyer Rd, Bldg 234, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, arichter@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joan McInerney, MD, FACEP</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: medical personnel available to perform life-saving interventions.  A common misconception is that all medical personnel can and will respond.  Surveying two New York Metropolitan Area hospitals, we assess the ability and willingness of physicians to evaluate and resuscitate victims of WMD terrorist events upon arrival to the hospital.  Significant factors influencing results are discussed and should form a more realistic basis for modeling efforts.</br>
