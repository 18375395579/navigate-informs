The administrator faces a trade-off between forming large wings to pool demand and capacity, and forming specialized wings to focus on a narrow range of care types. To inform this decision, we provide an optimization model and apply it to data from an urban teaching hospital.  We next consider a regulator of bed capacity who aims to predict and control the effects of capacity changes on society.</br>
