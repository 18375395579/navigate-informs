<br>Title: A Multi-stage Experiment Design in a Nano-enabled Medical Instrument Production Process</br><br>Author: Chumpol Yuangyai, Penn State, 310 Leohnard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, cuy113@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Harriet Nembhard</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: As many industrial experiments involve several processes in series, it becomes both prohibitively expensive and difficult to use a factorial design due to the complete randomization requirements of all treatments.  In this paper, an efficient-modified split plot design concept is proposed and then applied to the four-stage production process of nano-enabled zirconia parts for surgical instrument.</br>
