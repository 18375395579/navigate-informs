<br>Title: Heterogeneity, Network Position and Performance</br><br>Author: Jeongsik Lee, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 W Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308-1149, United States of America, Jeongsik.Lee@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: I examine how past performance influences actor positions and how accounting for endogeneity alters position-performance association. On the collaboration network of U.S. biotech inventors, I find that inventors with superior track records are more apt to occupy brokering positions. Controlling for past performance weakens the relationship between brokering position and patent performance. When inventor-level heterogeneity is accounted for, the position-performance correlation almost disappears.</br>
