Title: Incremental Capacity of Single to Double Track with Variable and Sparse Siding Spacing<br>Author: Ivan Atanassov, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Illinois RailTEC, B118 Newmark Lab, 205 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, atanass1@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tyler Dick, Mei-Cheng Shih<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This work examines the incremental capacity benefit of adding double track segments to single-track lines with sparse sidings and with variable siding spacing.  The work also examines differnt strategies for allocating the double-track resource across a railway subdivision.  These results will facilitate the development of an optimal incremental upgrade model for capacity expansion.
