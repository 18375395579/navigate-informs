A pilot study was conducted in Y-12 Occupational Health Services (OHS) and a management system was developed that monitors the flow of patients and resources in real time, assesses provider workload and predicts what the potential results are by changing schedules or the available resources, and optimizes the scheduling and availability of resources to provide the best throughput for the system.</br>
