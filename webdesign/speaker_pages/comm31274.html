Title: Real-time Location Tracking, Modeling and Simulation of Healthcare Systems<br>Author: Xueping Li, University of Tennessee, 408 East Stadium Hall, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States of America, Xueping.Li@utk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joe Wilck, Tom Berg<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We explore the use of real-time location services (RTLS) for healthcare systems optimization. A pilot study was conducted in Y-12 Occupational Health Services (OHS) and a management system was developed that monitors the flow of patients and resources in real time, assesses provider workload and predicts what the potential results are by changing schedules or the available resources, and optimizes the scheduling and availability of resources to provide the best throughput for the system.
