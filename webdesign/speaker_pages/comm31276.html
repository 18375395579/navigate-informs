Title: On Connections between RLT and Lift-and-project Relaxations for Rank Two or More<br>Author: Michel Minoux, Professor, University Paris 6, 4 Place Jussieu 75005 Paris, Paris, 75005, France, michel.minoux@lip6.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Hacene Ouzia<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We show  that  known simple links between  rank-1 Sherali-Adams  (RLT) relaxation and rank-1 Lift-and-Project closure do not readily extend to rank 2 or more.To investigate this issue, we introduce a new hierarchy of relaxations, intermediate in strength between the RLT hierarchy and the L&P hierarchy. This new hierarchy is shown to coincide with RLT for MIPs arising from pseudoboolean function minimization. Some preliminary computational results are also reported.
