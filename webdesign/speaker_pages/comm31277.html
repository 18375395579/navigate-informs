Title: Performance Characteristics of Flowshops with Work Flow Control<br>Author: Steven Harrod, Assistant Professor, University of Dayton, 1143 Ashburton Dr., Dayton, OH, 45459, United States of America, a2soft@aol.com<br>Coauthor(s): John Kanet<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Very often the terms pull and make to order are conflated and treated as synonymous. In this presentation we emphasize how this conflation is inaccurate, and by example demonstrate how important it is to describe the distinct combinations of push/pull and make to order/make to stock. Best practices are summarized by these combinations.
