Title: Conferences as Venues for the Configuration of Emerging Organizational Fields: The Case of Cochlear Implants<br>Author: Raghu Garud, Penn State University, rgarud@psu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: I examine how conferences can be occasions for the configuration of emerging organizational fields by describing three that I attended during the development and commercialization of cochlear implants. These conferences served as venues for a variety of activities to unfold ranging from the exchange of information to the enactment of technological possibilities. A full appreciation of conferences as holistic events, I argue, offers us a particularly valuable entry point into gaining a deeper understanding of how new fields are assembled in real time.
