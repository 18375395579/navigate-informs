Title: Emerging Approaches and Challenges to 3D-Printing for Tissue Engineering<br>Author: Rohan Shirwaiker, Assistant Professor, North Carolina State University, Dept of Industrial & Systems Engineering, 400 Daniels Hall, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, rashirwaiker@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sang Jin Lee<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: 3D-Printing techniques provide the ability to design and fabricate unique configurations of scaffold structures that are central to new tissue or organ formation in tissue engineering. Recent advances have enabled a paradigm shift from statically seeded polymer scaffolds to integrated 3D matrices with direct-printed live cells, although several challenges still exist. These emerging approaches and the current challenges to their lab-to-clinic translation will be presented.
