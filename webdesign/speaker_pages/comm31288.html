Title: A Game Theoretic Model of Financial Crises<br>Author: Jonathan Welburn, PhD Student, University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1513 University Avenue, 3237 Mechanical Engineering Building, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, welburn@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kjell Hausken<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Global financial crises have revealed the systemic risk posed by economic contagion. We formulate a game between countries, central banks, banks, firms, households, and financial inter-governmental organizations to model the dynamics between the players. We model strategic choices, determine equilibrium solutions, and simulate the impacts of random shocks. Our conclusions enhance the understanding of global economic risk.
