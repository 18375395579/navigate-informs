Title: Potential Impacts of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles on Locational Marginal Prices and Emissions<br>Author: Lizhi Wang, Iowa State University, 3016 Black Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, lzwang@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anhua Lin, Yihsu Chen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Temporal and spatial differences of locational marginal prices provide unique opportunity for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle drivers to take advantage of. We study how strategic recharging could impact locational marginal prices and emissions under decentralized and centralized decision making mechanisms.
