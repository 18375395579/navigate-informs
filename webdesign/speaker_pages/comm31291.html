<br>Title: Modeling the Forest Rotation Problem under the Influence of Kyoto Protocol</br><br>Author: Yavuz Gunalay, Bahcesehir University, Faculty of Economics and Admin Science, Istanbul, 34353, Turkey, yavuz.gunalay@bahcesehir.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erhun Kula</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Importance of the forestry sector has risen in recent years due to efforts to reduce the threat of climate change backed by the Kyoto Protocol. Forests because of their large biomass content make an important contribution to the global carbon cycle that has been recognised by the Kyoto Agreement which gives carbon credits to countries when they create new forest areas. Such credits affect the planning horizon especially for plantation forests.</br>
