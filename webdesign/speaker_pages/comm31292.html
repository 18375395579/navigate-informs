Although research has identified negative consequences for individual directors and top managers, inconsistent results across studies suggest that consequences may not accrue equally to all managers and directors. More importantly, the role of different stakeholders in apportioning consequences and the degree to which organizational leaders?actions may protect themselves from such consequences have not yet been fully elaborated. In addition, little is known about how changes in the institutional environment affect corporate misconduct and its after-effects.  In particular, regulatory punctuations after large-scale disruptions to business practice have the potential to change the way stakeholders respond to misconduct. By looking at the actions taken by internal and external stakeholders following revelations of misconduct before and after Sarbanes-Oxley, we explore these simultaneous gaps in the organizational misconduct literature. We argue that organizational misconduct is a stigmatizing event that leads both internal and external stakeholders to take purposive action in an attempt to avoid stigmatization. We analyze the effects of these actions on the degree to which both individual directors are stigmatized by association with organizational misconduct before and after the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation.</br>
