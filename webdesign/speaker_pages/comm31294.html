Past literature implies that tasks completed within the boundaries of one organization are easier to manage, standardize and improve, whereas tasks which require two organizations to interact are more difficult and complex to manage. Using patient data collected over a two year period, we distinguish the effects of intra-organizational tasks from inter-organization tasks on hospital performance.
