As part of its strategic planning and analytics initiative, an ad hoc committee is designing an interactive INFORMS Analytics Maturity that will be made available on the INFORMS website. It will allow you to examine three key aspects of your company/government agency/non-profit ?  ?Important characteristics of the organization (the impact of leadership, its people, key metrics/measures, and business processes)  ?Its analytic capabilities (analytic framework, roles & skills, analytic services, and analytic processes)  ?Data and infrastructure (data “health,?access, traceability, and analytic architecture)  This session will preview the model and explain how it will work, how you can access it when it goes live, and how you can make it available to colleagues at your company and at other organizations. The committee chair, Norman Reitter of Syngineering, and INFORMS Communications Director Barry List will provide this first preview and explain how you can incorporate the model into your work.</br>
