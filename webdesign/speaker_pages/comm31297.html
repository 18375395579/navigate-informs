Title: Collaborator Novelty and Creativity: Evidence from DARPA and MIT<br>Author: Phech Colatat, PhD Candidate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, E62-359, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, pcolatat@mit.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: There have been numerous attempts to understand the innovation model of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a highly regarded R&D organization.  In this paper, I uncover one aspect of the DARPA model using data from MIT patent disclosures.  Recent research on collaboration and creativity suggests that repeated collaborations can be detrimental to creativity. Consistent with this literature, I find that DARPA-funded research is less likely to involve repeated collaborations.
