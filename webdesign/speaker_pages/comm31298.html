<br>Title: Monitoring of Multistream Functional Data with Enhanced Diagnosability</br><br>Author: Qingyu Yang, Postdoctoral Research Associate, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1815 IOE Building, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48103, United States of America, qiyang@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In many complex systems, multistream functional data are often obtained through online sensing, which shows the dependency at both the spatial and time domains. This research aims to effectively utilize the independent component analysis method for the functional signal decomposition, which can achieve the enhanced system monitoring and diagnostic capability.</br>
