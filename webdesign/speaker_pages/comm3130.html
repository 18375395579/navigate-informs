<br>Title: Peptide Extraction Using Regular Expressions and Support Vector Machines</br><br>Author: Theodore B. Trafalis, Professor, The University of Oklahoma -- School of Industrial Engineering, 202 West Boyd room 124, Norman, OK, 73019, United States, ttrafalis@ou.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robin C Gilbert</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Short sequences of peptide are often contained only within the  published medical literature rather than in databases and thus are not  available until located and extracted. Herein we report the efficacy of  using regular expressions and support vector machines to differentiate  peptide sequences from the text that surrounds them. We have tested the  system on over 10,000 journal articles. Our results suggest that this  method will help in automated extraction of sequences from large texts.</br>
