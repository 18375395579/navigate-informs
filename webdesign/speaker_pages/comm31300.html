Kahn, Oguzhan Alagoz, Elizabeth Burnside, Jagpreet Chhatwal<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Although breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in the US, current methods in practice for diagnosis have low positive predictive values.  We developed an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict breast cancer risk from standardized mammographic findings and demographic risk factors.
