A common way to encourage individuals to donate to offer to match their gift. Conitzer and Sandholm introduced auctions that allow individuals to match each other's contribution. We explore this idea in a social network setting, where agents care about the contribution of their friends. We give mechanisms that raise the largest individually rational amount, and analyze the equilibria of this mechanism.
