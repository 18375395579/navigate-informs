Title: Overcoming Spreadsheet Risk in Supply Chain Modeling<br>Author: Larry J. LeBlanc, Professor, Owen Graduate School of Management, Vanderbilt University, 401 21st Avenue South, Nashville, Tn, 37203, United States of America, Larry.LeBlanc@Owen.Vanderbilt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Galbreth<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Spreadsheet optimization modeling plays an important role in the management of today’s sophisticated supply chains. However, it is inherent that spreadsheet risk occurs, defined as the chance of adverse operational or financial consequences due to errors in a spreadsheet. These risks arise because the intrinsic complexity of optimization models is beyond the expertise of many non-technical managers.  We show how to manage the substantial risks associated with the use of spreadsheets for optimization.
