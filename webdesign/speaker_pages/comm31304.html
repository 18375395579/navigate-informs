Title: An Experimental Study on Social Preferences and Supply Chain Performance<br>Author: Yaozhong Wu, Assistant Professor, NUS Business School, BIZ2 #03-08, 1 Business Link, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117592, Singapore, bizwyz@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Christoph Loch<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Supply chain contracting literature traditionally has focused on aligning incentives for economically rational players. We provide experimental evidence that social preferences for relationship and status systematically affect economic decision making in supply chain transactions, such that relationship preference promotes cooperation, individual performance, and high system efficiency, whereas status preference induces tough actions and reduces both system efficiency and individual performance.
