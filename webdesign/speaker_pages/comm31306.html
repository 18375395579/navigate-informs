One complication is naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) which leads to nuisance alarms. This paper describes data mining applied to RPMs as related to background suppression; efficient methods to examine multiple candidate alarm options; smoothing spectral data; sensor drift, and pattern recognition to recognize common NORMs.</br>
