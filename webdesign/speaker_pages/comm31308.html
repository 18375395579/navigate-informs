<br>Title: Value of Flight Cancellation and Cancellation Decision Modeling</br><br>Author: Jing Xiong, Phd Candidate, University of California, Berkeley, NEXTOR, 107E McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, jingxiong@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Current studies are focused on flight delays to assess the performance of the National Airspace System (NAS). However, flight cancellations should be studied to consummate delay metrics. In this study, we will explore Ground Delay Program (GDP) post operation data to infer the relative value of cancellations in terms of delay savings. Two cancellation metrics are developed for this purpose. In addition, we model flight cancellation decisions with a discrete choice model.</br>
