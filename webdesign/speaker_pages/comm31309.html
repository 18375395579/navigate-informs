<br>Title: Cloud Computing: Implications on Software Network Structure and Security Risks</br><br>Author: Terrence August, University of California-San Diego, Rady School of Management, 9500 Gilman Dr, MC 0553, La Jolla, CA, United States of America, taugust@ucsd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marius Florin Niculescu, Hyo duk Shin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: By software vendors offering, via the cloud, software as a service (SaaS) versions of traditionally on-premises products, security risks associated with software usage become more diversified which can greatly increase the value associated with network software. In an environment where negative security externalities are present and users make complex consumption and patching decisions, we construct a model that clarifies whether and how SaaS versions should be offered by vendors.</br>
