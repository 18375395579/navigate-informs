Business continuity management is about not making excuses. It’s about planning before a crisis event happens. It is a mind set by management that understands great companies never moan they are having problems because of a natural disaster, a terrorist event, a major recall, a fire, or a strike. To do this effectively requires planning and preparation, an understanding of risks and vulnerabilities, training for your employees and their families, and coordination within your own company up and down your supply chain. Great companies do well in spite of the event. Others fade away or worse. Yet, even now, in light of the lessons learned after September 11th and in far more recent events, many companies are not doing what’s necessary to ensure their own survival. Business continuity can’t be something that’s discussed after disaster strikes; rather, business continuity should be a critical part of a company’s way of life.</br>
