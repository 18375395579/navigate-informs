Title: Dynamic Models with Two Competitors<br>Author: Darius Walczak, PROS Revenue Managment, 3100 Main Street, Suite 900, Houston, TX, 77382, United States of America, dwalczak@prosrm.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a review of dynamic programming-based methods for a problem with two expected-revenue maximizers competing in a single market. We contrast a game theory-based model with other alternatives.  The former model is closely related to Dudey (1992, 2006), Talluri (2003), and Isler (2007).  We further investigate some of its properties.
