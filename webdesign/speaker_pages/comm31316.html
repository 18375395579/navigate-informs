Our models capture both supply- and demand-side influences of implementation. We characterize the firm's optimal/equilibrium decisions, both in the presence and absence of the system, under monopoly as well as under Cournot competition. Our focus is on understanding the firm's “willingness?to implement the symbiotic system.
