<br>Title: Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Using Mammography Bayesian Network</br><br>Author: Jagpreet Chhatwal, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 4126 Mechanical Engineering, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, jchhatwal@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oguzhan Alagoz, Elizabeth Burnside, Charles E. Kahn</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: While diagnosing breast cancer, radiologists need to interpret mammographic findings and make complex decisions such as surgical biopsy, and advanced imaging exams. We developed a Mammography Bayesian Network (MBN) based on the variables recorded by radiologist during their daily clinical practice to aid radiologists in the interpretation of mammograms. Training MBN’s parameters on the available data significantly improves its performance in predicting the risk of breast cancer.</br>
