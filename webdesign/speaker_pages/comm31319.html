It addresses some well-known issues in game theory. For example, in contrast to the Nash equilibrium, it provides one-time sensible solutions for Prisoner's Dilemma and Traveler's Dilemma agreeing with experimental results. Existence of the new equilibrium is established, its implications are discussed, and applications are presented.</br>
