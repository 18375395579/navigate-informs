<br>Title: Value of Information is Systematically Biased</br><br>Author: Steve Greidinger, Policy Decisions Forum, PO Box 30374, Bethesda, MD, 20284, United States, steve_greidinger@hotmail.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The expected value of imperfect information determines whether an inaccurate test or prediction is cost-effective.   Unfortunately, test results may not be properly interpreted or applied by decision-makers, and so we must discount the value of information in order to account for the possibility that the results will be ignored.  Value of a test may fall precipitously given political roadblocks and decision-maker indifference.  Suggestions for avoiding underutilized studies will be supplied.</br>
