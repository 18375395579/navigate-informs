<br>Title: How Keen are the Payers in Promoting Telemedicine ?Incentives for the Insurers</br><br>Author: Balaraman Rajan, Simon School of Business, University of Rochester, CS 4-339, Carol Simon, Rochester, NY, 14627, United States of America, balaraman.rajan@Simon.Rochester.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The adoption of telemedicine especially for the case of chronic disease management has been surprisingly slow. We use a markovian model to analyze the incentives for the payers in promoting telemedicine. While continuous disease management could reduce complications and help in preventive care, for the payor what might matter is the cumulative lifetime cost of a patient. The key to telemedicine is in an innovative payment system where the actual beneficiaries pay for the innovative practice.</br>
