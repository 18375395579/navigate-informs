While camera tracking is well  studied, the group following problem has not gained much  attention despite that there are many scenarios where it is  desired to maximize the visibility of moving targets. In  this work, we address the scalability issue by investigating  the idea of cached visibility. In this work, we show that  cached visibility provides better balance between efficiency  and performance.</br>
