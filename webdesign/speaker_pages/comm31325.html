Title: High Occupancy/Toll Lane Pricing under Stochastic Demand<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, 301 E Dean Keeton St Stop C1761, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lauren Gardner, Hillel Bar-Gera<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider and evaluate potential HOT lane pricing schemes, focusing on the issue of real-time pricing amidst uncertainty in demand  and driver value of time.  We conduct a set of experiments to demonstrate the impact that these stochastic factors have as their parameters vary.
