This creates major challenges in the form of (1) balancing electricity production and consumption at all times, under uncertain generation and consumption (2) encouraging customer participation. The talk will focus on a broker agent that aims at addressing these challenges. The broker is fully implemented and tested in the PowerTAC smart grid simulation environment.
