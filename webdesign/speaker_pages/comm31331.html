Title: Bidder Behavior in Multiple-Good Sealed Bid Auctions Where the Number of Bidders is Unknown<br>Author: Svetlana Pevnitskaya, Assistant Professor of Economics, Florida State University, 288 Bellamy Building, Department of Economics, Tallahassee, FL, 32306-2180, United States, spevnitskaya@mailer.fsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kurt Schnier, Mark Isaac<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the individual bidding data from a series of sealed-bid auctions with uncertainty over how many participants bidders will be bidding against. For risk-neutral individuals, there is a theory of bidding in this environment. In this paper we 1) Examine the performance of this theory using our individual bidding data, and 2) Extend the analysis to include the implications of risk preferences and potentially risk-averse bidders.
