<br>Title: Hybridization Noise Removal From cDNA Microarrays</br><br>Author: Chaitra Gopalappa, Ph.D Student, Dept. of IMSE, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, chaitra@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven Eschrich, Steven Enkemann, Tapas K. Das</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Microarray technology offers a significant tool for harnessing the true potential of human genome discovery via development of efficient disease diagnosis and treatment planning tools. A major impediment in this process has been the presence of noise distorting the gene expression values. We present a multiresolution strategy for removal of hybridization noise in microarrays.</br>
