Das<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Microarray technology offers a significant tool for harnessing the true potential of human genome discovery via development of efficient disease diagnosis and treatment planning tools. A major impediment in this process has been the presence of noise distorting the gene expression values. We present a multiresolution strategy for removal of hybridization noise in microarrays.
