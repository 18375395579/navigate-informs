Project MINDSET (Mathematics Instruction using Decision Science and Engineering Tools) is a $3 million NSF funded project designed to develop, implement, and evaluate a two-semester course for high school seniors based on the mathematics of operations research and industrial engineering. In this tutorial we will discuss two forces driving efforts to raise mathematics proficiency at the high school level: (1) minimum state standards for a high school diploma and (2) state university admission standards or expectations to be competitive. We will describe how the course we are developing is ideally designed to meet this growing need as well as address widely recognized US deficiencies in mathematics education. The primary goal of this tutorial is to motivate you to take on the challenge of bringing Project MINDSET to your local school district or possibly statewide. We will provide you with the skills and support services that will enable you to make it happen. The two major elements of the tutorial will be (a) Project MINDSET course content and how it is aligned with trends in high school mathematics education and (b) strategies for building a social network of influence to deliver a Project MINDSET course into local high schools.</br>
