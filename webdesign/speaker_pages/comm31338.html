<br>Title: The Effects of Problem Structure and Team Diversity on Brainstorming Effectiveness</br><br>Author: Svenja Sommer, Assistant Professor of Management, HEC School of Management, Jouy-en-Josas, France, sommers@hec.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stylianos Kavadias</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Since Osborne 1957 brainstorming has acquired a central role during the ideation stage of many product development projects. Yet, experiments reported in the social psychology literature suggest that group brainstorming is an ineffective way to generate ideas. We revisit the two different arguments and develop a formal model of idea generation in product development. We show that the answer is not unidirectional but contingent on the problem structure and team diversity.</br>
