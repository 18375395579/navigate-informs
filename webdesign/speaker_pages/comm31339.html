Title: A Comparison of Type I and Type III Eco-labels for Product Carbon Footprints<br>Author: Tony Craig, Post Doctoral Research Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, E40-220, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, tcraig@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edgar Blanco, Yossi Sheffi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Product carbon labels that communicate the carbon footprint of a product have emerged as a popular type of eco-label.  However, initial consumer feedback has indicated confusion at this type of label.  In this paper we present two models of carbon labels, one based on a Type III eco-label declaring the product’s exact carbon footprint and the other on a standard Type I certification-style eco-label.  We compare the results of the models on firm profits, emissions reductions, and social welfare.
