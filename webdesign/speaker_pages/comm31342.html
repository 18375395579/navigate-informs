<br>Title: Framework of Decision Support System for Intelligent Maintenance Systems</br><br>Author: Haixia Wang, University of Cincinnati, 598 Rhodes Hall, Center for IMS, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, United States, haixiaw2001@hotmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Lee</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Decision support system in Intelligent Maintenance Systems is to use predicted machine health information as well as historical data to optimize maintenance plans in a systematic way. It can be defined in three levels: equipment intelligence, synchronization intelligence, and operations intelligence. This presentation will present methodology, tools, and examples on how to realize the operations intelligence with least maintenance cost while maintaining service quality and productivity.</br>
