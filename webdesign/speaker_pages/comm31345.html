Title: Analyzing the System-wide Impact of Equipage-based Air Traffic Flow Management Algorithms<br>Author: Shervin Ahmadbeygi, Metron Aviation Inc., Reston, VA, United States of America, shervin.ahmadbeygi@metronaviation.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present algorithms to incorporate flight equipage information in Air Traffic Flow Management resource allocation mechanisms. These mechanisms enable proper management of mixed-equipage traffic and help flight operators utilize advanced avionics and increase operational efficiency. We use simulation to estimate the system-wide impact of those algorithms on airline operations.
