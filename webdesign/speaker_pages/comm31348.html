Title: On Comparing Flexibility Structures in Parallel Queueing Systems<br>Author: Douglas G. Down, Associate Professor, McMaster University, downd@univmail.cis.mcmaster.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir, Hayriye Ayhan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss two issues in the problem of comparing flexibility structures in systems of parallel servers. The first is the role of the server's scheduling policy. The second is how one may incorporate the variability of underlying distributions when making comparisons.
