<br>Title: On Comparing Flexibility Structures in Parallel Queueing Systems</br><br>Author: Douglas G. Down, Associate Professor, McMaster University, downd@univmail.cis.mcmaster.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir, Hayriye Ayhan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We discuss two issues in the problem of comparing flexibility structures in systems of parallel servers.
