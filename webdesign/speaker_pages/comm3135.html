Rardin, White Distinguished Professor, University of Arkansas, Industrial Engineering, Bell 4169, Fayetteville, AR, 72762, United States of America, rrardin@uark.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Healthcare delivery in the United States is in a crisis of inconsistent and sometimes dismal quality, safety and efficiency, with exploding cost.

This presentation reviews the vast array of opportunities in such healthcare systems engineering.</br>
