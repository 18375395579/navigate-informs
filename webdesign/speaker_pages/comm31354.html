<br>Title: Impact of Interorganizational Coordination And Quality Metrics In Offshore Execution of Processes</br><br>Author: Ravi Aron, Associate Professor, Johns Hopkins University, 100 International Drive, Room 1331, Baltimore, MD, 21202, United States of America, raviaron@jhu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Praveen Pathak</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the use of interogranizational information systems (IIS) that allow the flow of information as well as the exerting of managerial control across the boundaries of the firm and their impact on the quality of work executed offshore in knowledge-intensive processes such as in Drug Trials. We find that the use of IIS is positively associated with higher levels of quality of work unlike the use of managerial control and that the knowledge intensity of the work plays a moderating role.</br>
