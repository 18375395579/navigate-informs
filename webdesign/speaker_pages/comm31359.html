<br>Title: Service Process Modularization in E-Stores?Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Anu Bask, Postdocoral Researcher, Aalto University, Runeberginkatu 22-24, Helsinki, 00100, Finland, anu.bask@aalto.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hilkka Merisalo-Rantanen, Tuure Tuunanen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Service offerings call for new modular service process design approaches in addition to traditional service design methods. In this study, the order-delivery process of e-stores?supply chain is examined by utilizing constructs of service process modularization, modular reuse, and modular variation. Also a framework for analyzing order-delivery process and its modularity is developed.</br>
