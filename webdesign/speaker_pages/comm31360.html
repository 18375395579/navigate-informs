Title: Analysis of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) Mechanism in Combinatorial Auctions<br>Author: Sang Won Kim, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, skim14@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Sethuraman, Gabriel Weintraub<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Recent theoretical works show that the VCG mechanism can have undesirable properties, such as low revenues, in combinatorial auction settings. In contrast, recent empirical work shows the opposite for a specific important application. In this work, we develop new theoretical results for VCG mechanism that explain this apparent paradox. More broadly, we show when VCG is expected to perform well in applications and when it does not.
