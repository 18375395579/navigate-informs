Title: Experimental Operations Research<br>Author: J. Neil Bearden, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, Eller College of Management, Mcclelland Hall 417, Tucson, AZ, 85720, United States, jneilb@gmail.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: I survey laboratory studies of decision behavior in problems drawn from theoretical OR literature, focusing on job sequencing and revenue management. I argue that we should not be concerned with the “irrationality?of human decision making, but use OR models as standards to evaluate where decision making can be improved.
