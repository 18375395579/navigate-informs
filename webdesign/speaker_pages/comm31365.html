Title: Wireless Ad-hoc Biological Habitat Sensor Networks with Semantic Data Processing<br>Author: Ivan Guardiola, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering University of Missouri S & T, 223 Engineering Management 1870 Miner Ci, Rolla, MO, 65409-0370, United States of America, ivan.guardiola@ttu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In wireless ad-hoc networks often wireless radio transmissions are the most energy costly operation. Hence, in an effort to reduce the overall number of transmissions within such networks a semantic data processing technique is presented. In particular, this research focuses in the identification of animals through Hidden Markov Models in an effort to eliminate useless information and distribute the data processing necessary for identification amongst the sensors node participants.
