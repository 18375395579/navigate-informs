Hence, in an effort to reduce the overall number of transmissions within such networks a semantic data processing technique is presented. In particular, this research focuses in the identification of animals through Hidden Markov Models in an effort to eliminate useless information and distribute the data processing necessary for identification amongst the sensors node participants.</br>
