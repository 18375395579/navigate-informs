<br>Title: Estimating Intervention Effects From Per Contact HIV Transmission Rates</br><br>Author: Stephen Sorensen, Mathematical Statistician, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Mail Stop E48, Atlanta, GA, 30333, United States of America, zuc7@cdc.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stephanie Sansom</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: HIV transmission rates per partnership drive our compartmental model of HIV incidence among MSM in an urban city. Rather than using published partnership rates, we estimate them from a Bernoulli formula and data on per contact transmission rates, number of contacts per partnership, contact types and condom use. We compare our estimated partnership rates to those reported in the literature. We indicate the impact of various HIV prevention strategies on our transmission rate estimates.</br>
