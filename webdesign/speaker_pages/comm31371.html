To address the issue of “e-mail overload,?we describe a study that applies automatic document clustering to a message collection. This study provides evidence that clustering e-mail, including the assignment of weights to message attributes, improves users?ability to locate messages (over an ordered list). Consequently, we suggest directions for developing solutions for managing e-mail overload.</br>
