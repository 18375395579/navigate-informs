Title: A Solution for Addressing “E-mail Overload?Using Automatic Document Clustering<br>Author: David Schuff, Assistant Professor of MIS, Temple University, David.Schuff@temple.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozgur Turetken<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: E-mail has become the dominant tool for communications, but its volume is often overwhelming. To address the issue of “e-mail overload,?we describe a study that applies automatic document clustering to a message collection. This study provides evidence that clustering e-mail, including the assignment of weights to message attributes, improves users?ability to locate messages (over an ordered list). Consequently, we suggest directions for developing solutions for managing e-mail overload.
