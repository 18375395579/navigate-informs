Title: Burn, Baby, Burn: The Economics of Fuels Treatments<br>Author: David Butry, Building and Fire Research Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Tech, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 8603, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899, United States of America, david.butry@nist.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Geoffrey Donovan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Fuels treatments (the reduction of hazardous forest fuel load) can limit a fire’s rate of spread, reduce its intensity, and make initial suppression efforts more effective. We present a model that identifies the reductions in rate of spread, intensity, and suppression success required to equate the costs and benefits of a specified set of fuel treatments. Finally, we demonstrate that unlike fuel breaks? which are intended to stop a fire’s progress, fuel treatments must burn to be effective.
