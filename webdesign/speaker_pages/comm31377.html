We focus on three daunting societal challenges: energy and the environment; public health; and air congestion. Each focus area will feature a plenary presentation by a leader in the field, followed by a panel discussion involving key stakeholders from government and industry together with academic experts. This session is a panel discussion on aviation congestion.</br>
