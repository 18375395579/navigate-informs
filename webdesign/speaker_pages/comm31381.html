<br>Title: In Response to Surprise in New Firms: Interactions of Improvisation and Organizational Memory</br><br>Author: Yan Gong, University of California-Irvine, gongy@merage.uci.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ted Baker, Anne S. Miner, Dale Eesley</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes that two key factors related to organizational knowledge use will shape the outcome of responding to a surprise.  First, the organization’s memory enhances the chances that its surprise response will have a valued outcome. Second, both lower and higher levels of improvisation will have a relatively more positive impact on organizational outcomes than intermediate level of improvisation. We test these ideas using a sample of 141 surprise events.</br>
