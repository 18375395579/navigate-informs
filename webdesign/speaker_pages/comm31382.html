Title: When Supply-Chain Disruptions Matter<br>Author: William Schmidt, Harvard Business School, Wyss House, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, wschmidt@hbs.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Raman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We research and identify several factors that drive a differential impact of supply chain disruptions on company value. Our research reveals that the market distinguishes between disruptions not only based on the characteristics of the disruption, but also on the characteristics of the company which are under management’s direct control. Insight on this issue can help managers structure their operations and target risk mitigation efforts toward those disruptions that destroy the most value.
