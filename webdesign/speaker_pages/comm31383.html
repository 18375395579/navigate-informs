<br>Title: Malaria Treatment Distribution in Developing World Health Systems and Application to Malawi</br><br>Author: Hoda Parvin, Research Analyst, CNA, 4825 Mark Center Dr., Alexandria, VA, 22311, United States of America, parvinh@cna.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shervin AhmadBeygi, Mark Van Oyen, Peter Larson, Jonathan Helm</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present stochastic models to address malaria treatment distribution in developing world under demand uncertainty. We first analyze a two-stage stochastic programming approach to make aggregate-level nation-wide decisions. We then present a Markov decision model to develop operational-level transshipment strategies within a cluster of clinics.</br>
