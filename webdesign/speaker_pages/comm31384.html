Title: Is It Really Safe to Fly?<br>Author: Arnie Barnett, Sloan School of Management, E53-379 MIT, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, abarnett@mit.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This tutorial investigates how the mortality risk of passenger air travel has evolved over the last half-century. Much of the news is good: fatal air accidents in the First World are on the verge of extinction. But a near-extinct species can stage a major comeback, and I discuss future risks related to airport and midair collisions. I also discuss the menace of aviation terrorism, which might pose considerably greater risk to future air travelers than all other hazards combined.
