Title: Hiring, Firing and Employment Protection<br>Author: Tim Maull, PhD Candidate, Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, timmaull@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jussi Keppo<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We analyze how hiring and  firing costs as well as firing delays affect a firm's labor market demand. We solve the firm's optimal hiring and firing policies by using stochastic control. Then we study the properties of the optimal solution as well as comparative statics. Finally we perform a cross-sectional analysis over selected OECD countries.
