<br>Title: Information Based Branching Rules in Integer Programming</br><br>Author: Fatma Kilinc Karzan, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, fkilinc@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Martin Savelsbergh, George Nemhauser</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We address the issue of learning in the context of variable selection for branching in integer programming. We discuss some possibilities for performance improvement through analyzing fathomed nodes in the tree. We show experimental results demonstrating the benefit of deriving information from the fathomed nodes in the tree and different ways to guide the search using this information.</br>
