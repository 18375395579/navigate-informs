Title: Quality in Health Care<br>Author: David Czerwinski, MIT, Room E40-130, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, dczerwin@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas, Michael Kane<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We used medical insurance claims data to assess the quality of care that patients received. Claims data has the advantage of being readily available for a large number of patients. However, it has the disadvantage that the information it contains is quite limited and tends to be noisy. We developed a variety of statistical models focused on different aspects of quality care. We present our findings and discuss some of the interesting challenges involved.
