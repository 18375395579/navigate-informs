Title: Coagulation and Aggregation in High Temperature Aerosol Synthesis Reactors<br>Author: Chris Hogan, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St. SE, 103 Mechanical Engineering, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, hogan@me.umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Thaseem Thajudeen, Hui Ouyang, Ranganathan Gopalakrishnan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: High temperature reactors can be used for the production of nanomaterials in scalable quantities from vapor phase precursors.  In such systems nanoparticles grow via collisions, and collisions govern the produced nanomaterial size distribution function.  Through mean first passage time calculations we show that the collision rate coefficient accounting for nonspherical particle geometries and particle-particle interactions can be described through a simple dimensionless equation.
