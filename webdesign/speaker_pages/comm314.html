Title: Space-Time Modeling of Total Column Ozone Levels<br>Author: Mikyoung Jun, Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics / Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, smiky1008@gmail.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: For space-time processes on global or large scales, it is critical to respect the Earth's spherical shape. The cov fns of such processes should not only be positive definite, but be capable of capturing the dynamics. We develop space-time cov fns on sphere-time that are flexible for space-time interactions, especially space-time asymmetries. Our approach yields explicit expressions for cov fns, which has great advantages in computation. We apply our model to global total column ozone levels.
