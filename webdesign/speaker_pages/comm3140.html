A Construal Based View</br><br>Author: Chris Bingham, University of Maryland, 4519 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, cbingham@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: While research suggests that firms learn from their experience, little is known about how such learning occurs. Using data on the country entries of new venture firms we explore this gap. Specifically, we bring to light the importance of two forms of cognitive construal, both of which influence whether and how learning takes place over time. Overall, our findings have implications for the underexplored interplay between cognition and behavior that lies at the heart of experiential learning.</br>
