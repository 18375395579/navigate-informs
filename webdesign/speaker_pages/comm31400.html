<br>Title: Thanks, But No Thanks?:  Impact of Donor Behavior on the Humanitarian Logistics Chain</br><br>Author: Stephanie Gray Wilson, Assistant Professor, Captial University, Department of Psychology, Columbus, OH, United States of America, swilson@capital.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kathryn M. Bell, M. Ali Ulku</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Disaster response requires prompt and efficient organization and delivery of supplies and services in the Humanitarian Logistics Chain (HLC). Solicited and unsolicited donations are frequently provided by various, often uncoordinated, funding sources to assist with disaster relief. This paper explores the impact of different types of funding sources and donations on the HLC and offers a framework of how donor behavior impacts operations. We provide a research outlook for this emerging topic.</br>
