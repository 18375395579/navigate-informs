This talk describes challenges of adapting MIP formulations to multi-week team projects. The AMPL algebraic modeling language allows students to send challenging formulations to solvers. Data tables in spreadsheets also play a key role, though actual data values must often be reconstructed from limited information in the paper.</br>
