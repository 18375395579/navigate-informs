There are people who refuse to evaluate when they must due to insufficient information on forecasted threats. In this paper, we analyze Twitter data on Sandy and propose an approach to identify those people who are not willing to evacuate based on their postings on Twitter so local emergency management officials can keep their eyes on them when situations get worse.
