Title: A Generalized Perioperative Simulation as a Decision and Diagnostic Tool<br>Author: Daphne Sniekers, PhD Candidate, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, daphne.sniekers@mail.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Carter<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A generalised, simulation-based perioperative decision support tool has been designed to inform tactical level decision making. The primary intention of the tool was to evaluate various decisions regarding the effect of scheduling and availability of perioperative resources on patient flow. Through application at six hospitals, it was found that the tool is not only useful for decision making, but also to diagnose various efficiency issues that lead to poor outcomes.
