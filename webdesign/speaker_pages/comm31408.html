Title: Analyzing Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Stockpiles<br>Author: Laura McLay, Virginia Commonwealth University, PO Box 843083, 1001 W. Main Street, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States of America, lamclay@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jamie Dauberman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has the potential to prevent 70% of all cervical cancers.  The demand for the HPV vaccine is expected to dramatically rise, which could make our nation vulnerable to HPV vaccine shortages.  One major factor in the prevention of HPV vaccine shortages is the creation of vaccine stockpiles by the CDC. We use mathematical models to determine and analyze stockpile levels sufficient to minimize the effects of a production interruption for the HPV vaccine.
