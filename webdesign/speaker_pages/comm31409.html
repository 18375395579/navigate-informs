We test two hypotheses:  H1) controlling for staff size, greater delegation through the use of more staff types will decrease the throughput of visits, and H2) controlling for staff size, income per unit time generated by the practice is decreasing in the number of staff types.  We find evidence supporting both hypotheses.
