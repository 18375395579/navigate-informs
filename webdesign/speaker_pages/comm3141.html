Title: Dynamic Airspace Configuration Concepts and Algorithms<br>Author: Dr. Parimal Kopardekar, Associate Principal Investigator, Dynamic Airspace Configuration, NASA Ames Research Center, Mail Stop 210-10, Moffett Field, CA, United States, Parimal.H.Kopardekar@nasa.gov<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The paper describes concepts and algorithms for Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC).  The purpose of the DAC is to increase airspace capacity through strategic airspace organization and dynamic allocation of airspace and controller resources to reduce the imbalance between traffic demand and airspace capacity.  Preliminary findings demonstrating the benefits of these concepts will be discussed.
