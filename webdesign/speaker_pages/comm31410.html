<br>Title: A Stochastic Model for Estimating the Yield of ZnO Nanowire Growth Process</br><br>Author: Haitao Liao, Associate Professor, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, hliao@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jingyan Dong, Yong Zhu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this research, the growth process of ZnO nanowire arrays is studied. Based on the image data collected at different sites of a substrate, we develop a spatial compound Poisson model to estimate the yield of the growth process.</br>
