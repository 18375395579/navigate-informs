Writing for these audiences presents the challenge of presenting the material with many real world examples, illustrations, and scenarios so that students can connect with the topic of statistics.  Instructors appreciate the readability of a text and the inclusion of a generally accepted set of topics.  Instructors also desire many different forms of course support.</br>
