Yet little evidence confirms this link or explores its impact.  We examine these issues in software.    We show that software developed by open source teams is more modular than similar products from commercial firms; and modular software is more evolvable.  Our results suggest a product design is driven by factors other than function, with long term and unintended consequences for performance.</br>
