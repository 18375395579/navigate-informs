Title: Impacts of Data Standards on Patient Risk in Healthcare<br>Author: Paiman Farrokhvar, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering, Fayetteville, AR, United States of America, pfarrokh@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nebil Buyurgan, Ron Rardin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Data standards can increase patient safety and decrease risk in terms of improved inventory accuracy, and recall and outdate management procedures. This simulation study investigates different inventory management models as well as recall and outdate management practices for fewer system errors and better accuracy. Different scenarios are compared to suggest the best practices.
