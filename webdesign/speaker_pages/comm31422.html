Title: A Model of Terrorism and Counter Terrorism Expenditure<br>Author: Peiqiu Guan, PhD Student, University at Buffalo, Department of Industrial Engineering, 435 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260-2050, United States of America, peiqiugu@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhuang, Stephen Hora<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This research studies a game theoretic resource allocation problem under the budget limitation for both governments and terrorists. Our results show that the possibility of attaching multiple targets brings higher payoff to the terrorists and higher damage to the governments. Regression analysis suggests that the terrorist’s strategy depends on both government and the terrorist's target valuation, while the government strategy only depends on the government target valuation.
