Title: Measuring Inefficiency in Dynamic Traffic Networks: A Numerical Study<br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sukkusur@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kien Doan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this study, we first categorize different circumstances of the network inefficiency and the price of anarchy. Instead of finding a tight bound for the price of anarchy, we explore the trend of the network inefficiency in more realistic networks. We begin with the departure time choice single bottleneck model. Then the general dynamic networks are considered for different demand levels. Open questions of interest to the research community will be discussed.
