<br>Title: Bonder Scholarship: Estimating the Patient's Price of Privacy in Liver Transplantation</br><br>Author: Burhaneddin Sandikci, The University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, bus2+@pitt.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The end-stage liver disease patients in the United States join a waiting list for cadaveric liver transplantation. The details of the composition of this list are only partially available to the public. We call the loss associated with having suboptimal accept/reject decisions due to incomplete information as the price of privacy. We present different models (for an individual patient) to estimate the patient’s price of privacy. We also present numerical results parameterized by clinical data.</br>
