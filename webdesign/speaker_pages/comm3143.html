Title: African American Tourism and Inner City Economic Development<br>Author: Henry Louis Taylor Jr, Professor/Director, Center for Urban Studies, SUNY Buffalo, Main St Campus, Buffalo, NY, 14214, United States of America, htaylor@buffalo.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: African Americans spend 30 billion on tourism annually.  Yet, the travel and tourism industry largely ignores this market, as do many urban centers, attempting to revive their sluggish economies.  A potentially significant link exists between African American tourism and inner city economic development.  Developing black heritage tourism sites in inner city communities and connecting them to other regional tourist attractions, would spur inner city economic development.
