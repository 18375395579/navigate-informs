<br>Title: Assessing Appointment Systems' Operational Performance with Policy Targets</br><br>Author: William Millhiser, Assistant Professor, Baruch College, City University of New York, One Bernard Baruch Way, Box B9-240, New York, NY, 10010, United States of America, william.millhiser@baruch.cuny.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Emre Veral, Benedetto Valenti</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a paradigm shift in performance evaluation of outpatient appointment schedules. Our research addresses the traditional dilemma between patient and provider delays, but with operational performance metrics that assess probabilities of exceeding established thresholds instead of optimizing presumed cost functions. Our analysis reveals serious shortcomings in traditional schedules; the managerial decision space so far investigated in the literature is inadequate for operational control.</br>
