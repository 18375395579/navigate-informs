Our research addresses the traditional dilemma between patient and provider delays, but with operational performance metrics that assess probabilities of exceeding established thresholds instead of optimizing presumed cost functions. Our analysis reveals serious shortcomings in traditional schedules; the managerial decision space so far investigated in the literature is inadequate for operational control.
