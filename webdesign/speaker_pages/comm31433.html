<br>Title: Direct Solution of Systems of Linear Equations</br><br>Author: Joseph Elble, University of Illinois, Industrial Engineering, Urbana, IL, United States, elble@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nick Sahinidis</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The direct solution of Ax=b involves four main phases: ordering A for fill-in reduction and structural singularity detection, factorizing A into a product of two triangular matrices, solving for x, and optionally refining x to reduce computational error.  All four phases are investigated, and multi-threading is utilized to improve performance.</br>
