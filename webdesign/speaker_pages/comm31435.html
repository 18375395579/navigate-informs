<br>Title: Generating Robust Project Baseline Schedules</br><br>Author: Willy Herroelen, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, 3000, Belgium, willy.herroelen@econ.kuleuven.be</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Most research efforts in resource-constrained project scheduling assume a static and deterministic environment within which the pre-computed baseline schedule will be executed. Project activities, however, may be subject to considerable uncertainty which may lead to schedule disruptions during project execution. We discuss proactive project scheduling procedures for generating robust baseline schedules that are sufficiently protected against anticipated time and resource disruptions and reactive policies that may be deployed to repair the schedule during project execution.</br>
