We explore a less common option: leveraging existing literature. Our research objective is to facilitate building BNs by leveraging Natural Language Processing techniques to extract relevant pieces of information. In particular, we seek to extract and aggregate dependence and independence information (for structure) and probability statements (for parameters).</br>
