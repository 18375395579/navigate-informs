Title: Optimizing Counterinsurgency Operations<br>Author: Marvin King, Operations Research Analyst, US Army, 24025 High Meadow Dr., Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, Marvking3@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Alexandra Newman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a model that uses historic casualty information on counterinsurgents and insurgents, allied military force strengths, and economic data with modern counterinsurgency theories to aid in the estimate of force requirements for ongoing and future counterinsurgency campaigns.  Our mathematical optimization model provides insights that allow the military and government to make more informed decisions regarding the number of forces to deploy in future conflicts.
