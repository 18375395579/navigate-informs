Title: Confronting Elusive Insurgents<br>Author: Ed Kaplan, Yale University, School of Management, edward.kaplan@yale.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Roberto Szechtman, Moshe Kress<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Under what conditions should government forces attack insurgent strongholds? How should the government allocate its force across different strongholds when the insurgents' threat to the population must be taken into account?  How should the government respond to smart insurgents who anticipate government's optimal plan of attack and prepare accordingly? Using Lanchester models modified to account for imperfect intelligence, we approximate optimal force allocations for the government,  and model the resulting sequential force allocation game between the insurgents and the government where the (zero sum) payoffs are determined by government battle and homefront casualties.
