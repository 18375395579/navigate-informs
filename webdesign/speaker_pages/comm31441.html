<br>Title: Analytics for OR Access at a Large Teaching Hospital</br><br>Author: Retsef Levi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 100 Main Street, Building E62-562, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, retsef@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vivek Farias, Ryan Graue, Brett Simon, Elena Canacari, Dottie Sarno, Pete Panzica, Debra Rogers</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We leverage predicability in seemingly highly variable utilization patterns via tools that (a) predict utilization of a user defined set of surgical resources at some future time using relevant historical patterns and existing block booking data and (b) consolidate resource utilization in a manner that respects surgeon preferences/ constraints. These tools help Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center identify and utilize surgical resources that would otherwise have been lost.</br>
