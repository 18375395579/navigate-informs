Title: Stackelberg Routing in Competitive Networks<br>Author: Nicolas Stier-Moses, Assistant Professor, Columbia Business School, Uris 418, New York, NY, 10027, United States, ns2224@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jose Correa<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider an oligopolistic network game where one player has more  market power than the rest. The almost-monopolistic player can predict  what price-taker players will do. Hence, it can make decisions before  others, which allows us to use the framework of Stackelberg games.  Instead of studying Nash equilibria as previous work has done, we make  use of Stackelberg equilibria, and identify easy-to-characterize  strategies for the leader that have good performance guarantees.
