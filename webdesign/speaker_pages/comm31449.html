Title: Exploration vs. Exploitation in the Information Filtering Problem<br>Author: Xiaoting Zhao, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, xz337@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Darlin Alberto, Peter Frazier<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In information filtering, a computer filters irrelevant items from a stream of information too voluminous to process by hand (e.g., scientific papers, blog posts, satellite photos).  Such systems face the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff, in which it may be beneficial to present an item that is likely to be irrelevant, because feedback allows the system to learn and improve.  We present an analysis of this problem using stochastic dynamic programming, and an application to the arXiv.
