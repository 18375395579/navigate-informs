Box 217, Enschede, 7500 AE, Netherlands, r.basten@utwente.nl<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Logistic support analysis (LSA) is a key tool for integrated logistics support and hence well known in the defense world. LSA consists of a number of tasks, of which only spares optimization has received abundant attention in the operations research (OR) literature; level of repair analysis has received some. We show that OR has much more to offer to aid the LSA process and that LSA poses interesting problems to OR researchers. Solving these will also aid companies outside the defense world.
