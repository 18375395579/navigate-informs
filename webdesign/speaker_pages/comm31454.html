<br>Title: Relative Expression Analysis for Cancer Diagnosis and Perturbed Network Identification</br><br>Author: Nathan Price, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois, 600 S. Mathews Ave., 119 RAL, Box C-3, MC-712, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, ndprice@uiuc.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Using bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic data, we identified a highly-accurate classifier to differentiate gastrointestinal stromal tumor and leiomyosarcoma, two cancers that appear similar, but require very different treatments.  We have also developed a novel method, called pathway eXpression Rank AnalYsis (p-XRAY) for utilizing multiple relative expression reversals between genes within defined gene sets that are informative for identifying perturbed networks and disease diagnosis.</br>
