Our algorithm allows a clinic to schedule patient appointments so that aggregate clinic utility is maximized, balancing clinic productivity benefits with patient waiting and clinic overtime penalties.  Computational experiments show that our results are superior to other methods used in practice and proposed in the literature.</br>
