Title: Demand Management in Health Care Clinics with Variable Service Times<br>Author: Stephen Lawrence, Associate Professor, University of Colorado, 419 UCB, 995 Regent Drive, Boulder, CO, 80309, United States of America, Stephen.Lawrence@colorado.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Linda LaGanga<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this paper we extend our previous results regarding yield management in health care clinics to include appointments with variable service times. Our algorithm allows a clinic to schedule patient appointments so that aggregate clinic utility is maximized, balancing clinic productivity benefits with patient waiting and clinic overtime penalties.  Computational experiments show that our results are superior to other methods used in practice and proposed in the literature.
