Title: A Shannon Entropy Measure for Identifying Wavelet-based Feature Extraction<br>Author: Sagar Kamarthi, sagarkamarthi@gmail.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Shannon’s entropy measure is used for identifying competent wavelet coefficients. The features are formed by calculating the energy of coefficients clustered around the competent clusters. The method is tested on benchmark classification problems. The experimental results show that the method performs better than other leading feature extraction methods.
