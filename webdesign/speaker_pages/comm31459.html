Title: A Decision Quality Approach to Natural Gas Resource Uncertainty<br>Author: Robert Stibolt, Managing Director, Galway Group, L.P., 3050 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 1300, Houston, TX, 77056, United States of America, rstibolt@galwaygroup.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mazen Skaf<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The shale gas revolution started in North America has completely changed the dynamic of world natural gas markets. Implications are far-reaching, exciting, but also highly uncertain. For example, the shape of long-run supply curves depend on technology, geology, and geopolitics. This paper addresses these questions within a framework that embraces uncertainty while eschewing the illusion of precise prediction -- a key to developing natural gas strategies that are robust.
