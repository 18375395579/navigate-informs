RAD uses a Web interface that allows researchers immediate access to case descriptions and corresponding treatments. We will discuss the software architecture, algorithms, and data models for RAD, paying particular attention on how C++, SWIG, HTML, Linux, AMPL, and MySQL, are “glued together?with PHP, to build a seamless, efficient, flexible, and highly interactive system.</br>
