Title: Software Architecture, Algorithms, and Data Models for Radiotherapy Design I<br>Author: Arthur Hanna, Associate Professor of CS, St. Mary's University, One Camino Santa Maria, Computer Science Department, San Antonio, TX, 78228, United States, AHanna@StMaryTX.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Radiotherapy optimAl Design (RAD) is an academic radiotherapy treatment planning system. RAD uses a Web interface that allows researchers immediate access to case descriptions and corresponding treatments. We will discuss the software architecture, algorithms, and data models for RAD, paying particular attention on how C++, SWIG, HTML, Linux, AMPL, and MySQL, are “glued together?with PHP, to build a seamless, efficient, flexible, and highly interactive system.
