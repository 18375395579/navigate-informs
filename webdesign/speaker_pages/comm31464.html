Title: HASS or Non-HASS for Printed Circuit Board Manufacturing - How to Breakeven in MTBF vs. Cost<br>Author: Tongdan Jin, Teradyne, Inc., 300 Riverpark Avenue, MS 3001-14, North Reading, MA, 01864, United States, tongdan.jin@teradyne.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Electronic products usually exhibit early life profiles. Highly accelerated stress screening (HASS) can help weed out the early failures. However, many practitioners are cautious of HASS, particularly for capital-intensive electronic equipment manufacturers. In this paper a mathematical model is developed to address the benefit in improving MTBF of printed circuit boards vs. the investment in HASS. The model helps reliability engineers achieve the high reliability with a minimum cost.
