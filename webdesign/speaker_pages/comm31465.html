Title: Bayesian Updating in Educational Testing<br>Author: Douglas Jones, Professor, Rutgers Business School, One Washington Park, Room 1058, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, dhjones@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Educational testing agencies in the US must provide new test norm information every few years in States in order to provide tests in the K-12 learning assessments. This contrasts with the former requirement of new test norms every 10 years, and is a potentially expensive undertaking. This talk will explore Bayesian methods to use prior tests norms to update current client score data to provide the required new test norms.
