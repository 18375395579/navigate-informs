Title: Setting Priorities: Value-based Program Decision Making<br>Author: Patrick Driscoll, Professor, U.S. Military Academy, Dept. of Systems Engineering, Mahan Hall, Bldg 752, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, Patrick.Driscoll@usma.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Setting resource priorities for complex programs is recognizably difficult, a challenge compounded by the range of possible futures and the uncertainty contained in current performance estimates.  We introduce a value-based approach for assisting decision makers in this context that uses DOE, simulation, and efficient portfolio principles to minimize total value return variability to stakeholders while simultaneously maximizing average value return against a set of future scenarios.
