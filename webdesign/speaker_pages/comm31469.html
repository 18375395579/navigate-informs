<br>Title: The Spreadsheet as a Smart Programming Language for OR Applications</br><br>Author: Thomas Grossman, tagrossman@usfca.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We explore when spreadsheets can be the programming language of choice for OR models. Drawing on the 2008 Interfaces special issue on spreadsheet applications of MS/OR, we describe examples of high-impact OR application using spreadsheets. We discuss the features of the spreadsheet computer programming language, and explain why Excel is an integrated development environment, a rapid-development language, and a 4th-generation language.</br>
