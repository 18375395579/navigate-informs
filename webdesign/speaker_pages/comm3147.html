Title: Idea Generation and the Role of Feedback<br>Author: Joel Wooten, University of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America, jwooten@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karl Ulrich<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In many innovation settings, ideas are generated over time and managers face a decision about if and how to provide in-process feedback about the quality of submissions. We use innovation tournament field experiments to examine the effect of feedback on idea generation and show individual-level differences between no feedback, random feedback, and directed feedback.
