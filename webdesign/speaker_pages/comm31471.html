Title: Core Payment Mechanisms for Combinatorial Auctions<br>Author: Robert Day, Assistant Professor, Operations and Information Management, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Road, U-1041, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States, Bob.Day@business.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): S. Raghavan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk I will summarize recent results on Core payment mechanisms for combinatorial auctions and their merits relative to the VCG and other mechanisms. Equilibrium bidding behavior, complexity, algorithmic techniques, and connections to shill bidding and collusion will be discussed.
