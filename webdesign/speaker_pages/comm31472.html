We developed five machine learning approaches were considered to find important prognostic factors to predict the relapsed ovarian cancer. Our findings suggest that three most important prognostic factors (Pathologic Stage, Pathologic T, Cell Type) and to improve surveillance after treatment might lead to earlier detection of relapse.
