<br>Title: Defending Cyber Terrorism ?A Game Theoretic Approach</br><br>Author: Tridib Bandyopadhyay, Associate Professor, Kenensaw State University, 1000 Chastain Road, Kennesaw, GA, 30144, United States of America, tbandyop@kennesaw.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aniruddha Bagchi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Internet connectivity to SCADA networks opens conduit for malicious attacks on critical infrastructure firms. Victim firms inability to provide service ripple through the economy and give rise to high aggregate loss. Our game theoretic model analyzes multiple equilibria in optimal defense against attacks from cyber terrorists. Role of intelligence and severity of punishment are analyzed on public-private participation for optimal defense against cyber terrorism.</br>
