Title: Developments and Challenges in City Logistics<br>Author: Teodor Crainic, Professor, ESG UQAM and CIRRELT, Pavillon Andr?Aisenstadt, 2920, chemin de la Tour, Montreal, QC, H3T 1J4, Canada, TeodorGabriel.Crainic@cirrelt.ca<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We review recent developments and trends in the organization and business models for City Logistics as well as in models and methods proposed to address them. While significant progress may be observed, many challenging areas are still scarcely explored from an operations research perspective. We thus identify a number of research areas of major interest offering both significant scientific challenges and important impact potential.
