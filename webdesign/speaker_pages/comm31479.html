Title: Strategies for Learning about Customers in CRM<br>Author: Anand Bodapati, Assistant Professor of Marketing, The Anderson School, UCLA, 110 Westwood Plaza, B520, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States, bodapati@ucla.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Learning about customers is central to CRM. In very many situations, the ability of the firm to learn is low and learning rates are generally slow. We consider classes of problems where learning can be super-efficient in the sense that learning rates exceed the usually expected Cramer-Rao bounds. We discuss managerial contexts in which such classes of problems are encountered. Furthermore, we present optimal design strategies that accelerate learning in such contexts.
