Title: Struggles and Tournaments: A Conflict Model of the Emergence and Legitimacy of Chiropractic<br>Author: Karen Patterson, University of New Mexico, Anderson School of Management, Albuquerque, NM, United States of America, Patterson@mgt.unm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marvin Washington<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We contribute to the literature on institutional change examining how a nontraditional practice in an established field managed to exist and thrive, despite opposition, lack of traditional types of support, and lack of legitimacy. We do so by examining the role of chiropractic within the field of medicine, exhibiting the persistence of challenger practices and supporting the concept of institutional pluralism. Our research extends previous work by addressing the process of institutional change across levels of analysis.
