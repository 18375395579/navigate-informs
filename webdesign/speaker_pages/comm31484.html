Title: Challenges in Security Risk Analysis<br>Author: Robin Dillon-Merrill, Assistant Professor, Georgetown University, 418 Old North, Washington, DC, 20057, United States, rld9@georgetown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Liebe<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Security decisions must be based on threat scenario likelihoods, facility vulnerabilities, and the impacts of a successful attack in terms of mission loss, personnel loss, and economic loss.  While the need for a threat x likelihood x consequence approach is well documented, implementing such a process is not simple.  This presentation discusses several approaches to risk-based decision making as well as organizational consequences and challenges encountered implementing the processes.
