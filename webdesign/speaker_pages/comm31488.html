<br>Title: Continuing Education</br><br>Author: Stephen Powell, Dartmouth College, Amos Tuck School of Business, Hanover, NH, United States of America, Stephen.G.Powell@tuck.dartmouth.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: INFORMS initiated the process of creating a Continuing Education program in the spring of 2012. The highlights of our progress since that time include hiring a Manager for Continuing Education and creating two workshops: one Data Exploration and another on Professional Skills. I will provide an update on our accomplishments and plans in this area and solicit feedback on what types of continuing education offerings would be most valuable to members.</br>
