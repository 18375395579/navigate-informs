BlueReach provides a browsable directory of expertise categories to allow an information seeker to locate the right kind of expert.  BlueReach has been deployed globally and is currently being used in 23 different countries.  We discuss how the solution evolved over time, and the generally high level of acceptance from users and volunteer experts.
