Title: Technology Deployment Flexibility in the Natural Gas Industry<br>Author: Paul Enders, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 15213, United States, penders@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nicola Secomandi, Alan Scheller-Wolf<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We model the deployment of production and communication technologies in natural gas production as real options. Based on real data from Equitable Resources, we quantify the incremental value of optimally managing the adoption of production and communication technologies, as well as the additional value of modeling price and flow-rate uncertainty. We also provide insight into optimal investment and divestment patterns, and discuss how these generalize to other resource extraction industries.
