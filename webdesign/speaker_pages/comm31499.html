Title: An Operations Research Modeling of Incorporating Causes and Consequences of Work-related Health Problems<br>Author: Ahmad Sobhani, PhD Candidate, Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON, M5B 2K3, Canada, asi.sobhani@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): M.I.M. Wahab, Patrick Neumann<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Causes and consequences of an employee's performance variations due to the work-related Musculoskeletal injuries infrequently investigated in optimizing the performance of operation systems. This research first considers the effect of working environment aspects of an operation system by using a health-related Markov chain for each employee, and then optimizes the system performance under stochastic demand.
