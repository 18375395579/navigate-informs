We develop statistical algorithms to monitor publicly available sex service advertisements and group, classify, and characterize them in the context of patterns of potential interest to law enforcement and victim rescue organizations. We present approaches taken, summarize results obtained so far, and discuss their potential for mitigating this serious societal challenge.</br>
