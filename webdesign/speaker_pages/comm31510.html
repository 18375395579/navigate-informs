<br>Title: Store Loyalty as a Category-specific Trait C- What Drives It?</br><br>Author: Qin Zhang, Assistant Professor of Marketing, University of Texas at Dallas, SM 32, School of Managment, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, zhangq@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Manish Gangwar, P.B. (Seethu) Seetharaman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The literature on store loyalty views a consumer as possessing store loyalty to a particular store for their overall grocery shopping needs. In this study, we show that store loyalty is a category-specific trait of a consumer instead. We call it Store-Category Loyalty (SCL). We propose a model to investigate the factors that can potentially affect a consumer¡¯s SCL. We estimate the model using purchase data of 1321 households across 288 grocery categories and 16 stores.</br>
