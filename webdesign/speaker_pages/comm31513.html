Title: Intellectual Property and Technology Start-ups: Size Matters<br>Author: Kelvin Willoughby, Professor of Entrepreneurship & Intellectual Property, School of Electrical Engineering & Computing, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA, 6845, Australia, k.willoughby@curtin.edu.au<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Intellectual property features more prominently in the business of small entrepreneurial technology firms than it does in the business of large mature technology firms. Results of an empirical study of bioscience-technology firms in the US reveal that the strategies of entrepreneurial technology firms incorporate a distinctive intellectual property portfolio management approach, rather than a crude patent administration approach, to appropriating value from their technology.
