The model can be utilized for the determination of the optimal allocation of resources for multiple vaccine and medicine production, storage, and distribution to points of need in the case of disasters or epidemics. It may also be used by organizations to quantify the humanitarian healthcare supply chain costs in a transparent way to stakeholders.</br>
