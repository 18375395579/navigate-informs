Whinston, Wenjing Duan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A great number of online sharing communities have emerged and thrived in the past decade.  Many of them are member-based and voluntary, and they allow users to share files with one another.  In this research, we use a five-year log data set collected in an online music sharing community to examine how different types of users affect each other's activities and how their individual behavior is affected by the community overall.
