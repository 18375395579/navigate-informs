Title: PHM System Components and Applications<br>Author: Robert Cranwell, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 5800  MS 1011, Albuquerque, NM, United States of America, rmcranw@sandia.gov<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) systems are being developed at an increased rate due to potential cost savings and DoD mandates. A capable PHM system should be able to predict component failure far enough in advance to allow the modification of operations and maintenance schedules so that downtime and costs can be minimized. This presentation will provide an overview and representative applications of the three general areas of a PHM system: data, evidence, and consequence analysis.
