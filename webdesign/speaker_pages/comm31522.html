Title: Evading Moore's Law: Quantum Computing for Operations Research<br>Author: Dan Davis, Research Liaison  MHPCC, University of Southern California, Information Sciences Institute, 6275 E. 6th Street, Long Beach, CA, 90803, United States of America, ddavis@hpc-educ.org<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Lucas, Ke-Thia Yao, Thomas Lucas, Gene Wagenbreth<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The end of Moore’s Law growth impels a review of advanced computing, paying special heed to the real needs and pressing issues of management scientists.  After four decades of high performance computing, the authors now use quantum computing to implement OR applications.  They discuss technology promises and pitfalls, focusing their remarks on how adiabatic quantum annealing will assist DoD decision-making and enable effective processing of the data generated by new computer and sensor systems.
