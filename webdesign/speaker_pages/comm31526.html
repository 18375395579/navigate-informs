Title: Sustainability Incorporation in Modeling an Oil Supply Chain: A Case Study of Tullow Ghana<br>Author: Iddrisu Awudu, North Dakota State University, 26 University Village, Fargo, ND, 58102, United States of America, Iddrisu.Awudu@my.ndsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhang, Eric Asa<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This presentation will seek to integrate sustainability in modeling a crude oil supply chain setting.  Profit maximization incorporates economic, social and environmental factors such as job creation, corporate responsibility, and carbon impact respectively. A chance constraint programming is used to measure the level of CO2 emissions allowable into the environment. The results conclude that incorporating sustainability reduces how much the firm can allocate to corporate responsibility programs.
