However, it is often unclear which formulation “knob settings?are optimal.    This presentation will provide an example of linking a PD/PD modeling analysis to a formulation decision.  This enabled a client to see if altering a drug’s formulation could improve net patient benefit and if it was worth further investment.</br>
