Title: How To (and How Not To) Manage Supplier’s Process Improvement: Delegation, Incentives, or Audit<br>Author: Mehmet Gumus, Assistant Professor, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, mehmet.gumus@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mohammad Nikoofal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of process improvement as a supply disruption mitigation strategy in the presence of moral hazard and adverse selection. In order to address these issues, we develop a dyadic supply chain model where both the degree of supply disruption risk and supplier’s mitigation effort are unobservable from retailer. Our analysis shows that eliminating moral hazard via monitoring has a non-monotonic effect on the screening cost.
