In this context we have prospects with large returns and very small probabilities, and the currency used tends to be equity instead of money. The power utility naturally lends itself to both. We define the certain equivalent multiplier (CEM) as the certain return equivalent to the deal. We solve for the value of information and control in terms of the CEM, and we give approximations based on few moments.</br>
