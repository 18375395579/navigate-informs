The dichotomy has arisen due to the point or area treatment of the new facility. Participants will gain an appreciation of the common theory for location and layout problems, and how these results can help advance each field or bring them closer. It is suitable for students and researchers alike. We will draw upon research results of two NSF awards and associated papers.</br>
