Title: Prostate Cancer Decision Analyst:  Choosing the Best Treatment<br>Author: Jay Simon, Doctoral Student, University of California, Irvine, Operations & Decision Technologies, Irvine, CA, 92697-3125, United States, jsimon05@merage.uci.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A man diagnosed with prostate cancer faces a difficult decision.  Treatments have varying cure rates and a wide range of side effects.  We develop a multiple-objective decision model under uncertainty, which will be shaped by the preferences and personal characteristics of the individual.  This quantitative process will incorporate both user input and medical data, and will allow an individual prostate cancer patient to meaningfully compare treatments.
