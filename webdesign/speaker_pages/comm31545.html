Carroll School of Management, Boston College, 140 Commonwealth Avenue, Chestnut Hill, MA, 02467, United States, heimgr@bc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Wentworth</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: It is essential today for managers to determine the strategic implications posed by RFID. To the best of our knowledge, prior research has not analyzed how customer value will be provided via RFID, or what aspects of value customers might gain from RFID applications. We examine the customer value proposition of RFID within physical service environments. We develop a taxonomy of RFID applications in services, and use the taxonomy to examine survey data on value across the RFID application types.</br>
