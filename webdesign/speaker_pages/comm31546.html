<br>Title: Project Design with Limited Commitment and Teams</br><br>Author: George Georgiadis, Post-doctoral Scholar, California Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, Los Angeles, CA, 90025, United States of America, georgiadis@ucla.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Tang, Steven Lippman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the interaction between a group of agents who exert costly effort over time to complete a project and a manager who chooses its requirements. The manager has limited commitment power so that she can commit to the requirements only when the project is sufficiently close to completion. This is common in projects involving design or quality objectives. The main result is that the manager has incentives to extend the project as it progresses. We then explore the implications of this result.</br>
