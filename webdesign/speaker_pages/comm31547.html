Title: On Popular Demand: A Python Interface to MOSEK<br>Author: Ulf Worsoe, Senior Developer, Mosek ApS, Fruebjergvej 3, Box 16, Copenhagen, 2100, Denmark, ulf.worsoe@mosek.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Python is a scripting language which is becoming increasingly popular. It is generally considered easy to learn and use, and it is distributed with a large standard library.    MOSEK version 5.0 includes a complete Python interface to the MOSEK optimizers, implemented to induce a minimum overhead. We demonstrate some of the interface features that makes the Python interface a powerful prototyping and inspection tool.
