It is generally considered easy to learn and use, and it is distributed with a large standard library.    MOSEK version 5.0 includes a complete Python interface to the MOSEK optimizers, implemented to induce a minimum overhead. We demonstrate some of the interface features that makes the Python interface a powerful prototyping and inspection tool.</br>
