Title: Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy Planning<br>Author: Halil Ozan Gozbasi, Georgia Institute of Technology, 4573 River Parkway, Apt K, Atlanta, GA, 30339, United States of America, ozan@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Fox, Martin Savelsbergh, Eduard Schreibmann, Shabbir Ahmed, Ian Crocker<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: VMAT is a new technology in radiation therapy which delivers dose in a single 360 degree rotation of the gantry by simultaneously controlling leaf positions and dose rate. Treatment times are significantly smaller than with current IMRT technology, resulting in increased patient comfort, and treatment of more patients. We present an optimization algorithm to construct a VMAT plan and evaluate its results on a real patient case through a comparison with results from existing IMRT technology.
