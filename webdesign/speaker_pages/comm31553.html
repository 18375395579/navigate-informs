Title: Calculating Marginal Costs for Joint Output Energy Process Technologies<br>Author: Donald Hanson, Economist, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S. Cass Avenue, Bldg 900, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States, dhanson@anl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): John Marano, Peter Balash<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We will focus on joint output production processes (such as petroleum refineries and polygeneration) which can greatly improve efficiency. The solution to this class of problems involves process equations and their derivatives in order to calculate marginal costs and product prices. Energy and climate technology applications will be discussed and numerical results presented.
