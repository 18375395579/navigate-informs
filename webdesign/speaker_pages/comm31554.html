Title: Designing Profit-distribution Policies when Fairness Matters<br>Author: Claudia Márquez-Nava, Instituto Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Toluca, Plumbagos 12, Frac.

We found that an efficient Nash Equilibrium is only possible when this difference is low. On the other hand, if perceptions of fairness differ greatly, the unique Nash Equilibrium is trivial (zero production). We define the Fairness-Compatibility Index as a means to determine the nature of the Nash Equilibrium. This index is useful to predict partnership’s failure.
