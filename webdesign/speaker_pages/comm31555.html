Title: Optimizing Portfolios with Non-normal Distributions<br>Author: John Birge, Professor, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America, john.birge@chicagobooth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Luis Chavez-Bedoya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Return distributions are well-known to have characteristics such as negative skewness and heavy tails that are not captured by normal distributions.  We describe the characteristics of optimal portfolios with returns following a generalized hyperbolic (GH) distribution that accommodates many of the observed features absent from the normal distribution.
