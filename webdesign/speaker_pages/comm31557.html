This work discusses the guarantee of micro-irrigation running in dry season in Fazenda Tamandua. The effects of the landlord's supervision on the micro-irrigation are analyzed with a multiple-player game model. The outputs from the model and data show the influence of landlord’s supervision on the moral hazard between the stakeholders.</br>
