Title: Observational Learning with Finite Memory<br>Author: Kimon Drakopoulos, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 32 Vassar St., Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, kimondr@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John N. Tsitsiklis, Asuman Ozdaglar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a sequence of agents making decisions regarding the unknown value of the underlying state of the world after receiving private information and observing the decisions of their K immediate predecessors. We study conditions on the communication and information structure under which agents?decisions converge to the correct value of the underlying state.  Finally , we analyze the learning behavior of the equilibria that arise from a sequential game between forward looking agents.
