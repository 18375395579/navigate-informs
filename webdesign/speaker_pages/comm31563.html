Title: Risk Management with Value-at-risk and Stress Testing: An Alternative to Conditional Value-at-risk<br>Author: Alexandre Baptista, Assistant Professor of Finance, The George Washington University, Funger Hall, Suite 501, 2201 G Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, alexbapt@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gordon Alexander, Shu Yan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The popularity of VaR and Stress Testing (ST) raises the question of whether a risk management system based on both VaR and ST constraints is an effective alternative to one based on CVaR. When the VaR and ST bounds are properly chosen and short sales are disallowed, the constraints lead to the selection of portfolios with relatively small CVaRs. However, that is not necessarily true when short sales are allowed. Thus, the effectiveness of the constraints depends on the allowance of short sales.
