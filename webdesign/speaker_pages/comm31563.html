When the VaR and ST bounds are properly chosen and short sales are disallowed, the constraints lead to the selection of portfolios with relatively small CVaRs. However, that is not necessarily true when short sales are allowed. Thus, the effectiveness of the constraints depends on the allowance of short sales.</br>
