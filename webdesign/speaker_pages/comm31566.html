Title: Impact of Demand Forecast Uncertainty on National Airspace System Performance Estimates<br>Author: David Millner, The MITRE Corporation, 49185 Transmitter Road, Building 626, San Diego, CA, 92152, United States, dmillner@mitre.org<br>Coauthor(s): Jerome Freedman, Michael Callaham, Glenn Foster, William Baden<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This study considers the effect of demand uncertainty on the benefits of future National Airspace System improvements. Historic variation is added to the FAA’s Terminal Area Forecast (TAF) to produce future demand ranges that preserve time correlations and airport dependencies. The Fratar algorithm is used to produce future demand and delays are estimated via simulation. The results show how demand ranges provide better information about future performance than could be derived by the TAF alone.
