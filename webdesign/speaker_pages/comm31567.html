<br>Title: The Ethanol-Gas Flex Fuel Car: What is the Option Value of Choosing Your Own Fuel?</br><br>Author: Luiz Brandão, IAG Business School - PUC-Rio, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, Rua Marquês de São Vicente, 225, Gávea, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22451-900, Brazil, brandao@iag.puc-rio.br</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Renewable energy sources are becoming more important as the world’s supply of fossil fuels decrease and also due to environmental concerns. In 2003, the ethanol-gasoline flex fuel car (runs on ethanol, gasoline, or combination) became commercially available in Brazil.  Now 40% of the fuel consumption in Brazil is from renewable energy sources.   Flex fuel cars also provide the owner with the flexibility to choose fuels at each refueling stop. Given the uncertainty on future prices of ethanol and gas,  this option adds value to the owner since he can always opt for the cheaper fuel whenever he fills up his car. We use the Real Options method to analyze the value of the flex fuel option assuming both a Geometric Brownian Motion and Mean Reverting diffusion processes and compare the results.</br>
