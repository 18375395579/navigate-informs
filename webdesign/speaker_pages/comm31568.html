Title: Phase Transitions in Loss Networks<br>Author: Kavita Ramanan, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, kramanan@math.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brad Luen, Ilze Ziedins<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider Markov random field models of large loss networks,   and characterise the behavior of their steady state distribution.    In particular, we identify parameter values when so-called phase transitions occur, and describe their implications for performance   of the network.  This talk is based on various joint works with Ilze Ziedins and Brad Luen.
