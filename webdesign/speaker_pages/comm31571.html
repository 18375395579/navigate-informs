Operational Innovation (OI) has become a vital necessity for SPs. It affects what SP employees do every day and how they do that. Because it impacts the very core of delivery, there is an obvious risk associated with it. In addition variability and volatility of IT Services make it difficult to predict the value of improvement when deployed in production environment. We will have focused discussion on what are the skills, knowledge and approach, which should be defined and prescribed for study to students aiming to apply their intellect to discovering, developing, and validating new principles, theory, and methods which improve operations and management of enterprises.</br>
