If we solve for the optimal attacker decision using subjective expected utility, we are implicitly ignoring biases that humans exhibit in making decisions under uncertainty, like gain-loss effects and probability neglect. We model the attacker’s decisions using cumulative prospect theory and examine several potential in this context.</br>
