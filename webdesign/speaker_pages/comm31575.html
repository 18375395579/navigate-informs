Title: Combining Prescriptive and Descriptive Decision Theory in Counter-terrorism<br>Author: Jason Merrick, Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, United States of America, jrmerric@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Philip Leclerc<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Recent methods in counter-terrorism find the attacker’s optimal decision attacker as well as the defender, where both are faced with uncertainty about the outcomes. If we solve for the optimal attacker decision using subjective expected utility, we are implicitly ignoring biases that humans exhibit in making decisions under uncertainty, like gain-loss effects and probability neglect. We model the attacker’s decisions using cumulative prospect theory and examine several potential in this context.
