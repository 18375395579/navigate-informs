Title: Employee Retention Strategies of Entrepreneurial Firms under Uncertainty in Employee Capability<br>Author: Onesun Yoo, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, onesun.yoo@ucl.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): H. Dharma Kwon<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the employee retention strategy of growth-oriented entrepreneurial firms in which the employee’s capability is unknown to both the firm and the employee. We model this situation as a real options game between the firm and the employee, and we obtain a Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) characterized by the employment termination strategies of the two players. Our findings suggest that firms should assign employees with highly uncertain capabilities to tasks with high noise levels.
