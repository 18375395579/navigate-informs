We model this situation as a real options game between the firm and the employee, and we obtain a Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) characterized by the employment termination strategies of the two players. Our findings suggest that firms should assign employees with highly uncertain capabilities to tasks with high noise levels.</br>
