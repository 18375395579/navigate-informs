This means that companies need techniques to optimize their designs for life cycle cost. A lot of design-for-X paradigms have surfaced for (parts of) the life cycle. We conducted a literature study and thorough case studies with four companies to see which (quantitative) techniques are available and how they are used in practice. We identified weaknesses in the techniques and new research opportunities.</br>
