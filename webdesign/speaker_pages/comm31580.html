<br>Title: When I’m 64: Temporal Referencing and Discount Rates</br><br>Author: Shane Frederick, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 38 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, shanefre@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We show that people act more patiently when the future is referenced in terms of ages (When you are 47) than when referenced by corresponding units of time (e.g. In 9 years.)  We propose that an age reference directs attention away from the intervening time period, and toward other considerations.</br>
