However, demand is highly dynamic, noisy and interrelated among a wide range of products. Given many business constraints (e.g., a finite campaign budget) and numerous marketing options, we propose a system to design more focused and behavior-driven campaigns by incorporating new sources of data such as such as customer sentiment, browsing history, social media etc.
