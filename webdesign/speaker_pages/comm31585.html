<br>Title: Hypertension Management: A Value of Information Approach</br><br>Author: Manaf Zargoush, McGill University, 2107, 1411 Rue Du Fort, Montreal, H3H2N7, Canada, zargoush@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mehmet Gumus, Vedat Verter, Stella Daskalopoulou</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Hypertension is one of the most prominent risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this context, accurate measurement of blood pressure is vital. In this research we model two blood pressure measurement methods as Markov Decision Processes (MDP’s) and analyze the value of information (VOI) attributed to these two methods. We also identify the optimal policies under each measurement scheme.</br>
