Title: Quantifying Boundary Effect of Nanoparticles in Metal Matrix Nanocomposite  Fabrication Processes<br>Author: Qiang Zhou, Assistant Professor, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, qzhou3@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Micheal De Cicco, Xiaochun Li, Shiyu Zhou, Li Zeng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Lightweight, high strength metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) are promising materials. A uniform distribution of nanoparticles within the metal matrix is critical to its quality. However, a boundary effect often occurs where the nanoparticles tend to gather around the grain boundaries of the metal matrix. We propose a method for quantitatively assessing boundary effect in microstructure images of MMNC samples.
