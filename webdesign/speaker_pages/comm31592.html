Title: Uncertainty and Risk Estimation from Large Data<br>Author: Mohsen Bayati, Assistant Professor, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, Stanford, United States of America, bayati@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Murat Erdogdu, Andrea Montanari<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the fundamental problems of variance and risk estimation in high dimensional statistical modeling that has recently experienced a resurgence due to new applications, such as data-driven healthcare and online advertising.    In this context, we develop new estimators for the estimation risk and the variance of the noise from the data.
