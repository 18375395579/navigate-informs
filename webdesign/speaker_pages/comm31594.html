The Task Force report noted: OR represents a powerful tool to help improve the quality of investment decision making by illuminating key issues, assumptions and sources of information. OR is applied inconsistently throughout the defense and ISR communities. OR and the use of it can be strengthened in the defense and ISR communities through effective institutionalization. The utility of OR can be more firmly established through appropriate test cases. This presentation will update the DSB report and emphasize the value of OR and its power as a tool to help prove the quality of ISR decisions. It will describe the inconsistency of OR use in making ISR decisions and the types of changes that could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of OR applications in the ISR decision making process. It also identifies some of the critical attributes for achieving success using OR tools to make ISR decisions.</br>
