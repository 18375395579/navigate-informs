<br>Title: The Effect of Labor Market Mismatches on Entrepreneurship</br><br>Author: Briana Sell, Doctoral Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, Bsell3@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Henry Sauermann</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the sources and consequences of job mismatches in the Science and Engineering labor force using SESTAT survey data. The novel contribution is that it links mismatches to transitions into entrepreneurship among high ability workers. We hypothesize that mismatches are associated with a higher likelihood of entry into entrepreneurship since founding one’s own firm may allow workers to mitigate negative consequences of mismatches.</br>
