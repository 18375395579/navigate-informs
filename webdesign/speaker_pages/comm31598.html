Title: Environmental Impact Assessment of Transportation Networks with Degradable Links<br>Author: Qiang Qiang, Doctoral Student, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, 01003, United States of America, qqiang@som.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anna Nagurney<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose environmental impact assessment indices to evaluate the environmental effects of link capacity degradation in transportation networks. The indices are applicable in the case of either U-O or S-O behavior. We also construct environmental link importance indicators that allow for the ranking of links in transportation networks in terms of their environmental importance, should they be removed/destroyed. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed quantitative environmental indicators.
