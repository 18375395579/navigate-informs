Title: Better Before Worse Performance Dynamics in Product Line Expansion Strategies<br>Author: Shayne Gary, Australian Graduate School of Management, UNSW, Sydney, Australia, sgary@agsm.edu.au<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We combine in-depth fieldwork and formal simulation modeling to develop a process explanation for poor performance results often encountered in product diversification strategies.  Decision rules adopted by a global medical devices firm during a product line expansion are shown to generate ‘better-before-worse?performance dynamics.  This dynamic complexity undermines the strategy, even when the potential economies of scope benefits are significant.
