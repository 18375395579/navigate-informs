However, the current literature focuses on minimizing the travel time and deals with the computational complexity as a secondary criterion. We study TSP Race problem by redefining the objective of the TSP as minimizing the total time from getting the instance to finishing the tour and focus on the computation-implementation time tradeoff.</br>
