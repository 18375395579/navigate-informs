Title: A Hurricane-Supplies Stocking Problem with Wind-Speed Information Updates<br>Author: Emmett Lodree, Assistant Professor, Auburn University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 207 Dunstan Hall, Auburn, AL, 36849, United States, elodree@auburn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Selda Taskin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Several manufacturing, service, and government agencies are involved with responding to needs that arise after a hurricane makes landfall. These organizations are responsible for ensuring the availability of critical supplies needed to successfully carry out emergency response and recovery activities. This presentation defines a procurement/production problem characterized by information updates associated with hurricane wind speeds and describes algorithms for solving the problem optimally.
