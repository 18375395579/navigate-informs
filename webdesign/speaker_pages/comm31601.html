Title: Visual Exploration of Multi-attribute Trade Spaces during Complex Systems Design<br>Author: David Wolf, Graduate Research Assistant, Penn State University, 332 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, drw226@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gary Stump, Mike Yukish, Timothy Simpson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recent advancements in computing power and speed are revolutionizing trade space exploration, particularly for the design of complex systems such as automobiles and aircraft.  In this paper, we discuss Visual Steering Commands and a visualization tool that allows designers to interactively navigate multi-dimensional trade spaces.  We then describe examples that illustrate the trade space exploration process.  Comparisons to previous results and future work will also be discussed.
