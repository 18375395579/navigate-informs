Title: Of People, By People, and For People: A Pragmatic View of Business Service Engineering Acceptance<br>Author: William Ike Eisenhauer, Assistant Vice President of Loss Mitigation and Equity Operations, Wells Fargo CCG, ike@techsensei.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Engineering of business processes, in general, and servicing processes, specifically, are experiencing a resurrection in the United States. This effort, typically done to remain competitive and customer orientated, has brought with it a new exposure to operations research and its tools. This exposure has done a great deal to bring potential optimization and streamlining of labor intensive and costly servicing activities. However, too many times this potential, however justified by the data is never reached or even attempted by the business channel. We explore the typical barriers to acceptance of operations research and process engineering efforts in the real world and what can be done to overcome them. In addition, some suggested and proven methods are presented to assist and ease the integration of operations research and management science in to the day to day operations of servicing organizations. Examples presented are primarily in the financial services industry, but are applicable to any servicing industry.
