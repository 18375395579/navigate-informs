Following detailed workflow observations using a standardized instrument, patient instruction, urine testing and discharge process’s were redesigned.      With no additional expenditures, efficiency (ratio of patient-provider time to all other time in the clinic) improved more then 18%, patient and staff satisfaction by more then 15% and clinical outcomes more then 30%.</br>
