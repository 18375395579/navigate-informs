However, instead of developing within a virtual world, some virtual relations are just a reflection of friendship and affiliation in the real world. In this research, we estimate different types of virtual relations and test MTML models of co-evolving friendship and group affiliation using 15 million friendships and 4 million group memberships in Second Life.</br>
