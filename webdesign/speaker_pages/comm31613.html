Title: Real Options Analysis in Municipal Solid Waste Treatment Projects<br>Author: Luiz Ozorio, Associate Professor, Ibmec Business School, Av. Presidente Wilson,118/1114, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, lmozorio@ibmecrj.br<br>Coauthor(s): Carlos Bastian-Pinto, Jorge Luiz Assalie, Luiz Eduardo Brandao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The adequate destination of municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the biggest challenges of the humanity. Besides the environmental benefits, the MSW treatment projects can produce biogas to produce energy. Another issue that must be considered is that the increase in the processing capacity can be done in steps, creating the flexibility of delaying the project investments. This work indentifies the flexibilities in MSW projects in order to value their impact on NPV using real options analysis.
