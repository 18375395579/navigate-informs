Besides the environmental benefits, the MSW treatment projects can produce biogas to produce energy. Another issue that must be considered is that the increase in the processing capacity can be done in steps, creating the flexibility of delaying the project investments. This work indentifies the flexibilities in MSW projects in order to value their impact on NPV using real options analysis.</br>
