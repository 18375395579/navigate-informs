<br>Title: Dynamic Vectorcardiogram (VCG) Signal Representation and Diagnostic Applications</br><br>Author: Hui Yang, Industrial Engineering and Management, 322 Engineering North, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, hui.yang@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals monitor the spatiotemporal cardiac electrical activity along three orthogonal planes. Contrary to the loss of temporal resolution in the conventional static VCG representation, this paper presents an approach to capture the critical spatiotemporal heart dynamics by displaying the real time motion of a cardiac vector. The dynamic VCG representation is shown to significantly promote the interpretability and diagnosibility of VCG.</br>
