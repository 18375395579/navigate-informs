Profit functions are defined for involved stakeholders, and based on those profit functions, four players--representing carriers, operators, government and residents--bid on rent, financial incentives and wages in order to maximize their own profits. Eight scenarios are analyzed and compared to determine potential influential factors and appropriate conditions for FCC decision-making.</br>
