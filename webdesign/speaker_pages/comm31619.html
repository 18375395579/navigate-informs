Title: Value Discovery: Dynamic Decision Analysis<br>Author: Ibrahim Almojel, Stanford University, PO Box 15348, Stanford, CA, 94309, United States of America, mojel@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Manar El-Chammas<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study situations in which decision makers have a flow of deals which come over time. The decision maker can only accept a limited number of deals and has to immediately decide whether to accept or reject each one. An example is a VC evaluating business proposals. We solve this problem following the setup of the dynamic stochastic knapsack problem. In this context we find the dynamic value of information and that of control and discuss the value of the option of reversing a decision.
