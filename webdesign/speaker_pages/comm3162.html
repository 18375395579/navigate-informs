Title: Estimating Patient Wait Times in a Highly Uncertain Service Environment<br>Author: Craig Froehle, University of Cincinnati, Department of QAOM, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, United States of America, craig.froehle@uc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Faehnle<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Patients are often subjected to waits of difficult-to-predict durations.  Healthcare can entail queue disciplines combining most in need of service first with FCFS, and the number of servers (e.g., physicians) available to process patients can change quickly as needs arise. These and other sources of uncertainty make it challenging to predict how long a patient will wait. This research proposes and compares the performance of 3 methods using data from a high-volume pediatric radiology service.
