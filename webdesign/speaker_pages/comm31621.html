Title: Fire Engine Relocation Revisited<br>Author: Peter Kolesar, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States, pjk4@columbia.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In 1975 Rand Corporation researchers developed an on-line algorithm for tactical relocation of New York City fire engines when large fires depleted a region of the City of its fire protection. During the 9/11 crisis the algorithm -still used to this day -- assisted the FDNY in maintaining adequate fire protection throughout the City. We review the concepts of the algorithm and its implementation history.
