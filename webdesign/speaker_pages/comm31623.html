Title: Activity-based Travel Scenario Analysis with Routing Problem Reoptimization<br>Author: Joseph Y.J. Chow, Assistant Professor, Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON, M5B 2K3, Canada, joseph.chow@ryerson.ca<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A shared issue with the HAPP and generalized VRP is the computational cost of scenario analysis. Two reoptimization algorithms (solving with prior optimum) are proposed and tested in a computational experiment with 100 zones and 500 synthesized households. Two scenarios are evaluated: a major work destination closes down, and a freeway is added. Results demonstrate effectiveness of reoptimization and ability to re-allocate activities and schedules with respect to spatio-temporal changes.
