Title: Information Aggregation/Disaggregation based Crowd Tracking using UAVs and UGVs<br>Author: Mingyang Li, Research Assistant, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States of America, mingyangli@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jian Liu, Zhenrui Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Tracking crowds of people with UAVs and UGVs receives increasing attention in applications such as border patrol and crowd surveillance. The complementary characteristics of UAVs and UGVs indicate that aggregating/disaggregating information collected from both sides can significantly improve the tracking performance. This paper proposes a Bayesian inference framework to implement such aggregation/disaggregation. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
