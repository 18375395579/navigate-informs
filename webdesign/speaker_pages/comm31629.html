Hobbs, Christos Kolokathis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: SDP and Lagrangian Relaxation models are developed for unit commitment and dispatch under random wind production and load.  We compare their conclusions concerning the impact of increased wind penetration upon balancing energy costs and operating reserve requirements in the Netherlands, and contrast those results to those of a deterministic analysis.</br>
