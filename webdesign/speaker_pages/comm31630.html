Exercising the overfire option may  help to capitalize on more profits in the marketplaces than otherwise.  This option, however, runs with a risk of potentially damaging or  overstressing the turbine, which can be corrected by maintenances that  are performed in longer times or higher frequency. The tradeoff of using  this option is analyzed. The optimal strategy of exercising this option  subject to price uncertainties is also studied.</br>
