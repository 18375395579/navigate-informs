Title: Iterative Combinatorial Exchanges: An Experimental Analysis<br>Author: Benjamin Lubin, Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Maxwell Dworkin 217, 33 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States, blubin@eecs.harvard.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Parkes<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Expressive two-sided exchanges can increase efficiency in important  markets.  Our Iterative Combinatorial Exchange enables gradual value  revelation directed by linear prices and using an expressive bidding  language.  A VCG-based rule determines the final outcome.  Experiments  show computational scalability, limited agent computational  requirements, and the utility of price feedback.
