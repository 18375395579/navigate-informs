Our Iterative Combinatorial Exchange enables gradual value  revelation directed by linear prices and using an expressive bidding  language.  A VCG-based rule determines the final outcome.  Experiments  show computational scalability, limited agent computational  requirements, and the utility of price feedback.</br>
