Manne: Early Contributions to Sectoral and Economy-Wide Planning Models<br>Author: Donald Erlenkotter, Professor Emeritus, Anderson Graduate School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, United States, donald.erlenkotter@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: During the 1960s and early 1970s, Alan Manne made fundamental contributions in the development and application of sectoral and economy-wide planning models. These included models for capacity expansion and location, and interindustry models for planning economic development. His work is exemplary in its meticulous attention to data and its interplay between theory-based applications and applications-grounded theory. We review his contributions to these areas and their impact on the field.
