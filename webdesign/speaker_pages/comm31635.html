Holden Professor of Management Science, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, lwein@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We give an overview of our research in two areas of homeland security:  catastrophic biological events (preparing and responding to a smallpox attack, an airborne anthrax attack, and a botulinum toxin attack on the  food supply, and assessing infection control measures for pandemic influenza) and border control (preventing nuclear weapons from entering the country on a shipping container and from entering a city, using biometrics to prevent terrorists from entering the country, and analyzing U.S. immigration strategy from a homeland security viewpoint). We focus on the modeling, the policy recommendations and the implementation of these recommendations.
