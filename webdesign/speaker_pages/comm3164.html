However, the complex interactive nature of the system makes it difficult to quantify the systemwide impact of specific delays from historical data.  We present the results of a study where the impact of given absolute and relative delays are quantified through simulation for the different phases of operation, thereby enabling a comparison of the likely effectiveness of delay reducing technologies.</br>
