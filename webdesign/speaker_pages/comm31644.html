To increase the efficiency, we develop an approximation model which allocates the operating room capacity for different priority classes of emergency patients. The objective is to develop a capacity-allocation model that can achieve a better performance. This helps hospitals efficiently utilize the rest of operating room capacity to schedule elective surgeries.
