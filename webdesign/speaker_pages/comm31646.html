Title: Combining Imprecise or Conflicting Probability Judgments: A Choice-Based Study<br>Author: Aurelien Baillon, Erasmus University Rotterdam, P.O. Box 1738, Rotterdam, ZH, 3000DR, Netherlands, baillon@few.eur.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Laure Cabantous<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the impact on decisions of imprecise or conflicting probabilistic forecasts by experts. We define preference-based conditions over revealed beliefs (the precise probability leading to the same choice as an imprecise or a conflicting assessment) to characterize the decision maker’s attitude towards imprecision and conflict. We present an experimental study that shows that the type of uncertainty (conflict/imprecision), and the probability level, significantly influence revealed beliefs.
