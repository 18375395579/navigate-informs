Title: Modeling Biofuel Supply Chains with Real-world Geographies and Supply Uncertainty<br>Author: Yueyue Fan, Assistant Professor, University of California, Department of CEE, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, yyfan@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nathan Parker<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Design of biofuel infrastructure is dependent on the geography of uncertain supply and demand. A stochastic MINLP model is developed to design biofuel production and delivery infrastructures with real-world geographies and uncertainties.
