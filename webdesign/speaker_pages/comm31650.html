Title: Protection Planning for Critical Infrastructure Systems in Location Analysis: Models and Algorithms<br>Author: Federico Liberatore, University of Kent, Kent Business School, Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom, federico.liberatore@urjc.es<br>Coauthor(s): Maria Paola Scaparra<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the expansion and growth of the field of supply system reliability and facility protection. The main objective of this research is to formulate and solve optimization models that incorporate the characteristics of complex supply systems in order to mitigate the impact of destructions or malfunctionings of critical infrastructure.
