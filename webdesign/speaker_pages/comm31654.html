Title: Teaching Dynamic Programming and Duality Insights using Games, Interdiction, and Robust Optimization<br>Author: J. Cole Smith, Professor, University of Florida, P.O. Box 210020, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, cole@ise.ufl.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This tutorial discusses two aspects that often prove formidable to students:  Dynamic programming (DP) and duality. We first discuss games that help teach DP concepts to undergraduate students in an entertaining and accessible manner. This background permits an application-oriented discussion of duality, which can in turn be used to teach emerging topics in interdiction and robust optimization. As a result, students may better understand the scope and limitations of modern optimization topics.
