Title: Coordinating Transitions from Hospital to Skilled Nursing Facilities<br>Author: Jonathan Helm, Indiana University, 1309 E. 10th St., Bloomington, IN, United States of America, helmj@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sean Yu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Skilled nursing facilities (SNF) are a major bottleneck to discharging patients from hospitals in a timely manner. These facilities typically have two main sources of patients: hospital and community. High utilization at SNFs forces a choice of which patients to admit and which to delay. We develop an event-based dynamic programming approach to optimal admission control at the SNF that seeks to balance the needs of hospital, SNF, and community.
