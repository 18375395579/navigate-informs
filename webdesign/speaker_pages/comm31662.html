<br>Title: Distruptive IT and the New York Stock Exchange</br><br>Author: Wonseok Oh, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, QC, Canada, wonseok.oh@mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Henry C. Lucas, Jr.</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper examines three eras of IT at the NYSE, presenting a detailed 22-year history, and offers evidence that IT investments have helped the Exchange defend its market share.  We document the NYSE's investments in IT and improvements in capacity, market operations, and productivity.  The NYSE used IT to defend its business model of a physical exchange floor, but finally had to surrender to the transformational and disruptive technology of competitive all-electronic exchanges.</br>
