Title: The Effect of External Triggers on the Adoption of Environmental Improvements<br>Author: Enno Siemsen, Associate Professor, University of Minnesota, 3-150 Carlson School of Management, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, siems017@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Suvrat Dhanorkar, Kevin Linderman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Regulatory Institutions and Intermediary Agencies monitor, enforce and trigger environmental improvement. While government regulators exercise formal authority, local intermediaries depend on influence tactics. Using data from over 180 field projects, we analyze the delay in adoption of environmental recommendations, and contrast the ability of environmental regulators to coerce firms through inspections versus the ability of intermediary agencies to influence firms through systematic reminders.
