While government regulators exercise formal authority, local intermediaries depend on influence tactics. Using data from over 180 field projects, we analyze the delay in adoption of environmental recommendations, and contrast the ability of environmental regulators to coerce firms through inspections versus the ability of intermediary agencies to influence firms through systematic reminders.</br>
