Title: A Dynamic Mechanism for Achieving Sustainable Quality Supply<br>Author: Fang Liu, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, 639798, Singapore, liu_fang@ntu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Jing-Sheng Song, Tracy Lewis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Various companies have realized the importance of sustainable quality supply and initiated sustainability guidelines. However, are these guidelines sufficient to ensure sustainable quality supply? We design a dynamic mechanism that implements sustainable quality supply. Part of our mechanism suggests a two-part nonlinear tariff payment which is consistent with the existing industry guidelines; whereas the other part suggests new elements such as the probabilistic decision rights.
