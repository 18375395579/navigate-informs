Title: Analytics for Three-way and Dynamic Network Data with Application to Financial Market Surveillance<br>Author: Shawn Mankad, University of Michigan, 1085 South University Ave., 439 West Hall, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, smankad@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): George Michailidis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We introduce new tools to address the challenges of analyzing the increasingly vast and complex data encountered in Finance, Economics and Marketing. Specifically, we consider analyzing collections of data matrices that are typically organized from transaction-level data, and introduce a model for regularized matrix factorization that captures how structure evolves through time. The tools are used to summarize how lending dynamics in the interbank market changed during the sub-prime crisis.
