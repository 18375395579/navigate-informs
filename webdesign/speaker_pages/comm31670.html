Specifically, we consider analyzing collections of data matrices that are typically organized from transaction-level data, and introduce a model for regularized matrix factorization that captures how structure evolves through time. The tools are used to summarize how lending dynamics in the interbank market changed during the sub-prime crisis.</br>
