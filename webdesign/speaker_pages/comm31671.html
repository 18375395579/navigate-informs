<br>Title: Novelty and Appropriability: The Role of Entrepeneurial Knowledge</br><br>Author: Tony Briggs, Doctoral Candidate, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA, United States of America, tbriggs@bu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Why do entrepreneurs share information when others can steal their  ideas? I present an ex ante information sharing framework in which novel information is abundant but of predominantly poor quality.   Evidence of entrepreneurial knowledge about novel complementary asset combinations is illustrated by a historical example and by primary data from repeat entrepreneurs. Implications for strategy, knowledge management, and entrepreneurship are discussed.</br>
