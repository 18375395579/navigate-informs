Title: Optimizing Schedules for Prophylaxis with Antibodies<br>Author: Alexander Gutfraind, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1603 W.

Meyers<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Prophylaxis with synthetic antibodies can protect against infections when no vaccine is available.  Such a treatment could be lifesaving but also expensive.  We examined the case of Palivizumab, which targets the Respiratory Syncytial Virus in high-risk infants.  We show how optimization of the treatment schedule could improve the effectiveness of the treatment by 5-22% depending on the location in the US, or reduce its cost by up to 20%.
