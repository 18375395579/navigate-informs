After a series of changes, both radical and incremental, the same course is now one of the most popular and highly rated in our entire MBA program.  In this session, I'll describe the experience of re-making this class, with a special emphasis on the use of case studies to connect the soft aspects of project management practice to the hard OR/Project Scheduling methods that are so familiar to us.</br>
