Title: Product Configuration, Ambidexterity and Firm Performance<br>Author: Fabrizo Salvador, Professor, IE Business School, Calle Maria de Molina 12-5, MADRID, Ma, 28006, Spain, Fabrizio.Salvador@ie.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We identify two firm-level abilities—namely, product configuration effectiveness (PCE) and product configuration intelligence (PCI)—that explain how product configuration impacts firm performance. We link PCE and PCI to exploration and exploitation and, following the ambidexterity argument, propose that their interaction is associated to superior operational and financial performance. We find empirical support the ambidexterity argument relative to sales, but not to profit.
