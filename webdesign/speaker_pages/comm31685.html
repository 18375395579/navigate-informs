<br>Title: Not All Experience is Equal: Evidence from Indian Software Services</br><br>Author: Brad Staats, Doctoral Candidate, Harvard Business School, Morgan Hall 428A, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, bstaats@hbs.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Upton, Robert Huckman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In much of the existing literature, experience is treated as a unidimensional concept.  We use detailed data from an Indian software services firm to examine how operational performance might be affected by different types of group member experience.  We find that previous experience with group members has a positive effect on performance, but that conventional measures of individual experience do not.  However, we do find that role-specific experience helps explain performance in our context.</br>
