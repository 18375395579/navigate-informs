Title: Multi-echelon Inventory Models?An Overview<br>Author: Sven Axsäter, Lund University, PO Box 118, Lund, 22100, Sweden, sven.axsater@iml.lth.se<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We give an overview of stochastic multi-echelon inventory models starting with the early contributions by Clark and Scarf, and Sherbrooke. The main focus is on serial and distribution inventory systems. Different control policies and other assumptions are discussed. We describe the problems that we face when going from single-echelon to multi-echelon models. Advantages and difficulties with different approaches are analyzed. Finally, we discuss practical implications of the research results.
