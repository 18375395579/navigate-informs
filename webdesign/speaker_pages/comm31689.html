Title: Using a Fast Fashion System for Rapid Product Design with Strategic Customers<br>Author: Robert Swinney, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305-5015, United States of America, swinney@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gerard Cachon<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Fast fashion systems, which allow a firm to rapidly design and produce new products to meet changing consumer trends, have become increasingly popular in recent years. While the ability of a fast fashion system to match supply and demand via reduced production leadtimes has been well explored, its ability to match product design to shifting consumer preferences has received less attention. We focus on this aspect of a fast fashion system, and discuss the costs and benefits of such a strategy.
