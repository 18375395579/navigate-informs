However the competitive intelligence data may not, or most likely, will not have the same attributes and same values for attributes as a company’s own data. We developed a methodology to map the elements in these two data sets utilizing similarity indices. The methodology is robust in the sense that if an exact mapping is not available then the most similar match is identified.</br>
