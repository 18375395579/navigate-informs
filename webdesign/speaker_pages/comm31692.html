Title: The Combinatorial Clock Auction, Revealed Preference and Iterative Pricing<br>Author: Oleg Baranov, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, United States of America, oleg.baranov@colorado.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Ausubel<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The combinatorial clock auction (CCA) has recently become a popular choice for allocating highly valuable items. CCA suffers from three major problems. First, it is not a truly dynamic “pay-as-bid?auction. Second, it creates serious tensions between activity rules and bidder incentives. Finally, CCA activity rules are known to produce bidding anomalies. We propose a CCA enhancement that includes a new set of activity rules and a dynamic pricing method that eliminates these problems.
