CCA suffers from three major problems. First, it is not a truly dynamic “pay-as-bid?auction. Second, it creates serious tensions between activity rules and bidder incentives. Finally, CCA activity rules are known to produce bidding anomalies. We propose a CCA enhancement that includes a new set of activity rules and a dynamic pricing method that eliminates these problems.</br>
