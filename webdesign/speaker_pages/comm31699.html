The paper competition is organized by the Junior Faculty Interest Group (JFIG) forum in INFORMS. JFIG was created in 2001 to promote the career development of tenure-track faculty in INFORMS. The goals of the paper competition are to encourage research among junior faculty and to increase the visibility of research conducted by junior faculty within the fields of operations research and management science. Six finalists are selected by the award committee and their papers are presented in these two sessions.

Winners are announced at the JFIG lunch on Sunday at the INFORMS Annual Meeting.
