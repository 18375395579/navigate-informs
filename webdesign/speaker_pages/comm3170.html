Title: Stochastic Programming and the Option of Doing it Differently<br>Author: Stein W. Wallace, Professor, Molde University College, PO Box 2110, NO-6402, Molde, Norway, Stein.W.Wallace@hiMolde.no<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Option theory and stochastic programming are tightly linked. Most options can be analyzed in both frameworks, and the two approaches support each other in many slightly more complex situations. But this similarity hides some central differences in perspective: Option theory can be applied only to options already identified, while stochastic programming is able to help us find options in contexts where it is not at all clear what they are, and where finding might be more important than valuing.
