<br>Title: A Game-theoretic Model for Jamming Radio-controlled Improvised Explosive Devices</br><br>Author: Kyle Lin, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Rd, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, kylin@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu-Chu Shen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: An electronic jammer can emit electromagnetic energy to interfere with radio signals that detonate improvised explosive devices.  Due to power and other constraints, the jammer often needs to select which radio frequencies to interfere with.  This presentation discusses a game-theoretic model to solve this problem.</br>
