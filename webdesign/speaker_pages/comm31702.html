In this study, we analyse the effect of volcanic ash to air transportation system performance at the national and worldwide level. We focus our analysis on Icelandic volcano ash event, and apply to the hypothetical case of Korea's Mt. Baekdoo eruption to assess the level of disruption to the Korean and nearby airspace.</br>
