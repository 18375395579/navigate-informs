Title: Towards a General Preference Model Over Time Itself<br>Author: Jeffery L. Guyse, Associate Professor, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, College of Business Administration, 3801 West Temple Avenue, Pomona, CA, 91768, United States, JLGuyse@csupomona.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Trading monetary outcomes off over time has received significant attention by researchers. Likewise the psychological literature on perceived time is well developed. In this study we investigate the value function of time itself, independent of direct monetary considerations. The model can shed insights on how time is valued in a waiting or leisure setting, with special attention given to expectation and the shape of the value function.
