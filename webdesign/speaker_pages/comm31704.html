Title: Augmentation Algorithms for Linear and Integer Linear Programming<br>Author: Jon Lee, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, United States of America, jonxlee@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jesus De Loera, Raymond Hemmecke<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Taking motivation from Bland's LP generalization of the theoretically-efficient Edmonds-Karp max-flow algorithm, we generalize his augmentation scheme to integer programming, with some surprising consequences.
