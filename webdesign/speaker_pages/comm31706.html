Title: Analysis of Interaction Structure Among Process Variables in Semiconductor Manufacturing<br>Author: Qiang Huang, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, huangq@eng.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xi Zhang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) process, interaction patterns among chemical and mechanical process variables could be explored to characterize and improve process conditions. We investigate interaction structure among process variables for better understanding of physics of process condition changes.
