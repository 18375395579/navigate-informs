<br>Title: Impact of Payer-Provider Integration on Quality, Access, Cost, and Social Welfare</br><br>Author: Aaron Ratcliffe, Aaron_Ratcliffe@kenan-flagler.unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ann Marucheck, Wendell Gilland</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a queuing game to analyze interaction of a profit-maximizing health provider which chooses quality and capacity and cost-minimizing insurer which sets its coinsurance rate.  We compare quality, access, cost and social welfare between a competitive managed care model and integrated model where the provider insures its patient population.</br>
