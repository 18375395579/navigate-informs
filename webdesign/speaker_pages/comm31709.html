<br>Title: Scheduling Engineering and Production Lots in Wafer Fabrication</br><br>Author: Reha Uzsoy, Professor, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, uzsoy@ecn.purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kristy Crist, Brian Kelly</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a simulation study examining the performance of different scheduling policies for allocating machine capacity between production and engineering lots in a semiconductor wafer fab. Our results indicate the basic tradeoffs involved in this problem, and suggest a broader view of the problem is required for effective solutions.</br>
