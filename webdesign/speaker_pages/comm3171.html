<br>Title: Making MaxDiff More Informative: Statistical Data Fusion by Way of Latent Variable Modeling</br><br>Author: Lynd Bacon, SVP Analytics, Polimetrix, Inc., 285 Hamilton Ave, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA, 94301, United States, lynd@polimetrix.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Lenk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: MaxDiff Scaling (AKA Best/Worst Analysis), is a special kind of choice-based conjoint that has been steadily gaining popularity in recent years.  One weakness of it is that individual differences in scale origin are lost.  We describe a type of HB model that “fuses?MaxDiff and rating scales data so that scores relative to a sample-level common origin can be estimated. We compare specifications that are and are not consistent with Random Utility Theory, and provide example applications.</br>
