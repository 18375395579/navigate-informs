<br>Title: Mean Field Equilibria in Dynamic Auctions</br><br>Author: Krishnamurthy Iyer, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, kriyer@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ramesh Johari</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recently, motivated by applications in electronic commerce, there has been a significant interest in the modeling and analysis of repetitions of simple auctions. Although standard techniques have not seemed promising, a large market approximation known as mean field equilibrium has been successful in characterizing bidder behavior and in market design. In this talk, we present an overview of the current results, and discuss new results for repeated common value auctions.</br>
