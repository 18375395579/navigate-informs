Title: The Globalization of Science & Engineering Capabilities: A Dynamic Perspective on Next-generation Offshoring<br>Author: Arie Lewin, Duke University, ayl3@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephan Manning<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The growing shortage of domestic science and engineering (S&E) talent and the increasing availability of talent and supportive infrastructures in emerging economies have led to a new offshoring dynamic: the globalization of S&E capabilities. Using results from the Offshoring Research Network, this paper examines how this trend has resulted from macro-economic developments, domestic and offshore national policies, industry dynamics and the sophistication of firm-level offshoring capabilities.
