Title: Can the Human Inclination Toward Fairness Help Employers Manage the Cost of Prescription Drugs?<br>Author: Robert Nease, Vice President of Knowledge Management, Express Scripts, 13900 Riverport Drive, Maryland Heights, MO, 63043, United States, RNease@express-scripts.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Employers often consider changes to the pharmacy benefit to manage costs. However, concern about employee reaction stops many plans from making such changes. This concern is based largely on the assumption that people are self interested. We briefly review evidence to the contrary, focusing on the anomalous human desire towards fairness. We speculate as to a possible evolutionary explanation for this anomaly, and present example communications that take advantage of this human attribute.
