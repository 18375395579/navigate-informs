Title: The Diffusion of No-Regrets Environmental Technologies<br>Author: Karl Ulrich, Professor, The Wharton School, 500 Huntsman Hall, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, ulrich@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The International Panel on Climate Change reports that global greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by more than 2 gigatonnes of carbon per year at no net cost. This analysis is met with skepticism by most economists. This talk reports on empirical research to understand the extent to which no regrets environmental innovations actually exist in practice and to explain the way these innovations diffuse.
