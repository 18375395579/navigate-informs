However, the maturity of cyber effects models lags behind that for traditional military elements (e.g., sensors and kinematic weapons). This presentation introduces the analytical challenge of assessing cyber warfare capabilities within a classic integrated air defense analysis and suggests some key considerations for integration of cyber operations into such analyses.</br>
