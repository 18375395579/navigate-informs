Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, phuang1@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhongju Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate the relationship between participation in Internet-enabled knowledge communities and a major career event: job hopping. We find that while contributing behavior leads to a higher likelihood of job switch, greater amount of learning is associated with higher probability of staying with the current firm. In addition, we find that the social capital one builds through the interaction with others on the knowledge network moderates these relationships.
