<br>Title: Modeling and Simulation Methodology: The Challenge of Complex Endeavors</br><br>Author: Bernard Zeigler, Professor, Arizona Center for Integrative Modeling and Simulation, Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85715, United States of America, zeigler@ece.arizona.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Complex Endeavors have been defined as arising when a large group of disparate entities join together to achieve a common goal.  Such endeavors pose extreme challenges to current modeling and simulation methodology.  In this talk, we review the issues that have been raised and discuss cutting edge approaches and technologies that can help address these challenges.</br>
