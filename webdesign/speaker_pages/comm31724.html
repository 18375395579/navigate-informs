However, equity considerations can be incorporated as a variety of constraints or even as part of the objective function. As constraints they can be compared on the basis of lost infections averted. As parts of the objective function, the debate turns to the goal of a resource allocation. Inherent in this debate are the consequences of errors in the model, especially for the underserved populations.</br>
