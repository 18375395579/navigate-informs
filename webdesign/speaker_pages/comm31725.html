Title: Erosion Monitoring and Treatment Under Uncertainty<br>Author: David Tomberlin, National Marine Fisheries Service, David.Tomberlin@noaa.gov<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Managers face a trade-off between monitoring erosion and applying erosion treatments.  Deciding upon the optimal allocation of funds between monitoring and treatment is difficult because the management problem is inherently dynamic, the effect of treatment is uncertain, and erosion levels are observed with error.  We apply a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) approach to erosion management, using a point-based heuristic solver suitable for practical operational decisions.
