Title: Value Based Management<br>Author: Ian Williams, Decision Options, LLC, 94 Anchorage Circle, Groton, CT, 06340, United States of America, iwilliams@decisionoptions.com<br>Coauthor(s): Gill Eapen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Pharmaceutical Industry invests large amounts in Research and Development on drug candidates exhibiting high levels of uncertainty and decision flexibility. Allocating capital into these research projects is often inefficient either due to the application of traditional techniques or more qualitative processes at work. Through a series of examples, we illustrate how such companies practice better project selection, portfolio management, and enter into collaborative arrangements with partners.
