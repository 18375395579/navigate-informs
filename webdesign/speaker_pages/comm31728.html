We develop a new algorithm to adjust the voxel weighting factors and reference doses automatically to navigate on the Pareto surface to find out a plan with a desirable DVH or dose distribution. The applications of the algorithm in automatic treatment planning, adaptive radiotherapy re-planning and interactive treatment planning would be presented.</br>
