Title: Planning Strategies for Home Health Care Delivery<br>Author: Maciek Nowak, Associate Professor, Loyola University Chicago, 1 E.

Previous research focusing on continuity of care uses planning horizons that are often a week or shorter. We demonstrate that considering a longer horizon in this setting has potential for savings. With inherent uncertainty in planning for such a long time horizon, a methodology is presented that anticipates future patient requests that are unknown at the time of planning.
