Inspired by a remark in  David Gale's  famous  paper, “A theorem on flows in networks?(Pac. J. Math. 7, 1957),  D. Coppersmith and I have, over the past ten years,  studied  properties of  n-dimensional space whose coordinates are in G: polyhedral combinatorics, convexity topics (Carathedory, Helly, ...).  Some conjectures have become theorems, and vice versa.  I will also discuss some relevant work by others, most notably, Phil Wolfe and Uwe Zimmerman.</br>
