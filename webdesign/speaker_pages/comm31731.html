The Space Tracking Surveillance System (STSS) demonstrated the value of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  Quality of Service (QoS) metrics are being used as analytics to develop traceability from performance specifications to the mission effectiveness, system risk, and affordability of alternative BMDS architectures.</br>
