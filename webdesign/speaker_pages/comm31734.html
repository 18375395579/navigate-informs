Title: Incorporating Incomplete Information in the SMART and SWING Methods<br>Author: Ahti Salo, Professor, Helsinki University of Technology, PO Box 1100, TKK, 02015, Finland, ahti.salo@tkk.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Raimo P Hämäläinen, Jyri Mustajoki<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We introduce a preference programming approach based on interval-valued statements in order to accommodate preferential and informational imprecision in SMART and SWING weighting methods. In the proposed generalization, the reference attribute can be any one of the attributes and the decision maker can reply to weight ratio questions with intervals. We also present the related WINPRE software which is available for academic use at http://www.sal.hut.fi/Downloadables/winpre.html .
