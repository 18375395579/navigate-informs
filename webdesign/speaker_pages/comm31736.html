Title: Optimal Allocation of Resources in Information Gathering and Container Screening for Port Security<br>Author: Aniruddha Bagchi, Associate Professor, Kennesaw State University, 1000 Chastain Road, Kennesaw, United States of America, abagchi@kennesaw.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jomon Paul<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a game theoretic model that analyzes the interaction of information (intelligence) gathering and screening in securing cargo containers in ports. We use this model to determine the impact of (i) improving the accuracy of screening and (ii) efficacy of programs like C-PAT that allows expedited screening to trusted importers. We find that an increase in the opportunity cost of time enhances the importance of information gathering.
