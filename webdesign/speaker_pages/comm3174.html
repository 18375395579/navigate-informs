<br>Title: Capacity Planning and Participant Scheduling in Clinical Research Units</br><br>Author: Jivan Deglise-Hawkinson, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, jivan@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Van Oyen, Blake Roessler</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Clinical trial protocols demand complex coordination of physical and human resources over time for each participant. A clinical research unit site must service many trials. We develop a novel stochastic planning model that uses forecasting and optimization to control participant mix, access and staff overtime. We also recursively optimize and update the daily participant booking reservation strategy and the daily staffing coordination plan to transition from planning to real time scheduling.</br>
