The data for the sample is retrieved for the largest 10,000 city-pairs in the domestic U.S. for the recent 38 quarters. Several econometric models were estimated where the dependent variable represents the change in the number of airlines serving in the market. Several independent factors, representing different markets characteristics, are examined.
