Title: Open Source Texts and Teaching Materials<br>Author: John Chinneck, Professor, Carleton University, Systems & Computer Engineering, Ottawa, ON, K1S 5B6, Canada, chinneck@sce.carleton.ca<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A variety of freely-available textbooks, examples, assignment questions and other teaching materials are now easily found on the web. What advantages and disadvantages do these have over standard teaching materials? Should anyone be free to alter the content on an open source textbook as is done in a wiki? This talk will explore such questions in relation to the author's experience with an online textbook.
