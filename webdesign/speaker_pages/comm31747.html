<br>Title: Auctions Design for Online Display Advertising Exchanges</br><br>Author: Santiago Balseiro, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, srb2155@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Omar Besbes, Gabriel Weintraub</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Ad Exchanges are emerging markets where advertisers may purchase display ad placements directly from publishers via a simple auction mechanism.

In particular, we provide sharp prescriptions regarding the reserve price, the allocation of impressions to the exchange versus an alternative channel, and the disclosure of viewers' information.</br>
