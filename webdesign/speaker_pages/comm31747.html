Using the novel notion of a Fluid Mean Field Equilibrium we study key auction design decisions that publishers face in these markets. In particular, we provide sharp prescriptions regarding the reserve price, the allocation of impressions to the exchange versus an alternative channel, and the disclosure of viewers' information.
