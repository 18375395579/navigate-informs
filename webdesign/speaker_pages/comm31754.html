Title: Enhancing Predictability under Block-time Uncertainty through Flight Prioritization<br>Author: Lu Hao, University of California Berkeley, 107D McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, haolu@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Predictability is increasingly recognized as an important performance metric for the NAS. Block time variability is a major impediment to predictability and one potential way to improve it is through departure flight prioritization. In this research we will investigate how departure sequencing can be used to lower block-time variance. We will present algorithms and practical rules to swap departures to reduce block-time variance.
