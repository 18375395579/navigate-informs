Huntsman Hall, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, avalluri@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ravi Aron, Lyle Ungar</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we use computational methods to investigate how firms allocate production of services between different wage regimes and service characteristics, namely, in-house, onshore, offshore and automated utility. Our model was motivated by a survey we conducted with executives at different Fortune 500 companies. We also study the impact of different service characteristics on the allocation of production across the different wage regimes.</br>
