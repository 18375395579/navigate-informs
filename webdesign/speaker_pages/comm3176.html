Title: Integer Programming for Instance Selection in Supervised Learning<br>Author: Walter Bennette, Student, Iowa State University, Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Eng, 3004 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, bennette@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sigurdur Olafsson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Aspects of a classifier’s training dataset may negatively affect the ability of the classification algorithm to induce an accurate classifier.  For example, class values may overlap, classes may have outliers, or minority classes may be ignored.  We will introduce instance selection techniques that utilize integer programming to select a subset of the data in such a way that all or some classification learning algorithms will perform better when applied to the new and reduced training dataset.
