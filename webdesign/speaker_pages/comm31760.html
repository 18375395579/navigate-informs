Title: Decomposing Retailers' Same Store Sales Growth Rate to Forecast  Performance<br>Author: Saravanan Kesavan, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27516, United States of America, skesavan@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Raman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Most US public retailers announce their same store sales growth rate. Investors pay close attention to this metric as they believe it is an indicator of future financial performance. In this paper, we argue that it is important to identify the reasons for growth as they have different implications for future performance. Further, we present a new metric that adjusts for the causes of growth and show that it contains information that can be used to predict future financial performance.
