Investors pay close attention to this metric as they believe it is an indicator of future financial performance. In this paper, we argue that it is important to identify the reasons for growth as they have different implications for future performance. Further, we present a new metric that adjusts for the causes of growth and show that it contains information that can be used to predict future financial performance.</br>
