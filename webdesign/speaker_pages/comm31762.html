Eser Kirkizlar, Julie Swann</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model for diseases where our goal is to determine the best timing for testing (and treatment) decisions when the presence of the disease is not known in advance. We focus on minimizing the cost from a societal perspective, and additionally produce an efficient frontier of timing decisions with respect to the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) measure. We apply the model to Hepatitis C, and we discuss the insights for healthcare practice.</br>
