<br>Title: Disrupting Terrorist Networks using Network Flow Centrality</br><br>Author: Susan Martonosi, Harvey Mudd College, 301 Platt Blvd., Claremont, CA, 91711, United States of America, martonosi@hmc.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Terrorist networks are vast and complex, and counterterrorism strategies for disrupting these networks depend on their structure and the metric used to measure disruption.  We discuss a particular type of disruption to the network that forces communication through a key member to increase, making that member more visible to intelligence officials.  Using existing knowledge of the structure of terrorist networks, we explore which strategies yield the greatest disruption.</br>
