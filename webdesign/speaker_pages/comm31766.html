In particular, we will address where the topic fits into the overall curiculum.  Does it belong in the business school or in the OR department (or both)?  Does it deserve an entire course?  What should and should not be taught in the subject?  Is it likely to become a lasting part of the Business School curiculum (like Ops Mgt.) or not?  Is the airline story still relevant?</br>
