Title: Panel Discussion: Issues in Pricing and Revenue Management Education<br>Author: Robert Phillips, Nomis Solutions, robert.phillips@nomissolutions.com<br>Coauthor(s): Itir Karaesmen, Costis Maglaras, Ioana Popescu, Nicola Secomandi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The purpose of this panel is to discuss what works and doesn't work in teaching pricing and revenue management.  In particular, we will address where the topic fits into the overall curiculum.  Does it belong in the business school or in the OR department (or both)?  Does it deserve an entire course?  What should and should not be taught in the subject?  Is it likely to become a lasting part of the Business School curiculum (like Ops Mgt.) or not?  Is the airline story still relevant?
