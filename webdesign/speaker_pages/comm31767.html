Title: Mechanism Choice and the Sourcing of External Knowledge<br>Author: Michael Lenox, Professor, Duke University, 1 Towerview Rd., Durham, NC, United States of America, mlenox@duke.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Firm innovation strategy has shifted to an emphasis on the sourcing of extramural knowledge that resides outside the firm.  Researchers, however, have tended to treat the mechanisms for securing such knowledge in isolation. In this project, we study the tradeoffs between various external knowledge sourcing mechanisms. We highlight the complex portfolio planning problem that firms face as they decide how best to allocate their innovative effort.
