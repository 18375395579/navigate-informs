Researchers, however, have tended to treat the mechanisms for securing such knowledge in isolation. In this project, we study the tradeoffs between various external knowledge sourcing mechanisms. We highlight the complex portfolio planning problem that firms face as they decide how best to allocate their innovative effort.</br>
