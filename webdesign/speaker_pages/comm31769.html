Title: Interdependence of Critical Infrastructure Operations: Fire Response and Water Distribution<br>Author: Elizabeth Bristow, Assistant Professor, U.S. Military Academy, Dept. Civil & Mechanical Engineering, Bldg. 752, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, elizabeth.bristow@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kelly Brumbelow<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Effective fire response is crucial to cities?security, but this critical infrastructure is itself dependent on a robust water distribution system, which may depend on other critical infrastructures.  Consequences of interdependence of critical infrastructures on each system’s operation are not well known.  This work presents a model which simulates the operation of interdependent infrastructures to predict the consequences of multi-infrastructure failures and to design mitigation strategies.
