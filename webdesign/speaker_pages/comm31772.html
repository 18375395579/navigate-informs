Title: Harvest Risk: An Introduction to Quantitative Modeling  and Optimization in Agriculture<br>Author: Edmund Schuster, MIT, edmund_w@MIT.EDU<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Since the dawn of agriculture about 12,000 years ago, farmers have dealt with several categories of risk in producing the food needed to sustain their lives and to build urban centers of industry and learning.  In this presentation, we examine quantitative methods for modeling the risk associated with the harvest of Concord grapes.  The technique involves a real-world problem in capacity planning and was implemented at a large agricultural cooperative.
