Title: Exploring the Role of Novel Biomarkers to Improve Breast Cancer Screening Strategies<br>Author: Elissa Ozanne, Harvard Medical School, 101 Merrimac St., 10th Fl., Boston, MA, 02114, United States of America, elissa@mgh-ita.org<br>Coauthor(s): Yiwey Shieh, Laura Esserman<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Breast cancer screening practices have made modest reductions in mortality while incurring enormous societal costs. Biomarkers associated with genetic predisposition and short-term risk promise to advance the field. To guide implementation of such markers into clinical decision-making, we employ cost-effectiveness analysis to explore possible combinations of these tests with standard screening modalities and chemoprevention.
