Title: Efficient Pricing of Discretely Monitored Barrier Options in a Lévy Model<br>Author: Gudbjort Gylfadottir, University of Florida, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, gudbjort@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Farid AitSahlia<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a recursive method to price barrier options of European exercise style and where the underlying is assumed to follow an exponential Lévy process. The option is monitored at a specific set of discrete dates. Our method relies also on an efficient combination of quadrature approximations with the Lévy-Khintchine representation.
