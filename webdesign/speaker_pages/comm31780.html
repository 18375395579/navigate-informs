<br>Title: Proactive Retention</br><br>Author: Kush R. Varshney, IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, krvarshn@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Moninder Singh, Jun Wang, Yingdong Lu, Aleksandra Mojsilovic, Mark Squillante</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Voluntary attrition is a costly problem for organizations with large workforces.  In this work, we develop a methodology to predict employees at risk of resigning and develop analytics and optimization methods to determine retention bonuses in the form of salary increases for employees that provide the optimal monetary benefit to the organization.  We demonstrate the approach on data from a real-world corporation.</br>
