Instead of performing all their R&D activities in-house, companies are now increasingly looking for new ideas outside the boundaries of their own organization. As a result, the portfolio of external sourcing modes firms engage in has expanded. This thesis focuses on the use of different modes for external technology sourcing, including strategic alliances, corporate venture capital investments, and mergers and acquisitions.</br>
