Title: Analysis of Really Big Tables<br>Author: Matt Taddy, Chicago Booth, University of Chicago, Chicago, United States of America, taddy@chicagobooth.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: When regressing onto a high-dimensional set of explanatory variables, it is often possible to summarize the data in a multi-way contingency table.  We can then look at how cell-counts for explanatory variables change with the response, and use the relationship to build scores for predicting future response.  We'll discuss adaptive learning and design for a case study on the scoring of Twitter posts for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment directed towards US politicians.
