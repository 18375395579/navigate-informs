What about planning and the use of the information to impact the future? Tools we might actually use for support in this direction are either ad hoc and rudimentary or prohibitively complex and demanding. But better help many be on the way.  This talk will consider ways in which tool support might help us to manage our information for a world as we want it to be.</br>
