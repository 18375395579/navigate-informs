Empirical studies of water management in real political context point to the oversimplifications of these assumptions. What is the implication of this bias and why does it pose challenges to how water gets managed? This talk will explore several case studies to highlight the inconsistencies between the rationality axioms and the objectives of integrative water resource management.</br>
