Title: Logistics Contracts in Manufacturing<br>Author: Osman Engin Alper, University of California, IEOR, Berkeley, CA, 94530, United States, engin@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyun-Soo Ahn, Phil Kaminsky<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The value of integrating production and logistics operations is increasingly appreciated by managers, while at the same time logistics outsourcing is becoming a more prevalent across many industries. Motivated by this observation, we develop models of logistics contracts in manufacturing systems, characterize optimal policies, provide computational results, and summarize practical implications.
