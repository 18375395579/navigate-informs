Herrmann, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, College Park, MD, United States of America, jwh2@umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research has created mathematical and simulation models of mass dispensing and vaccination clinics and implemented these in decision support tools to help emergency preparedness planners design clinics that have enough capacity to serve residents quickly while avoiding unnecessary congestion.  This has led to new queueing system approximations for estimating the performance of workstations with batch arrivals, workstations with batch processes, and self-service workstations.</br>
