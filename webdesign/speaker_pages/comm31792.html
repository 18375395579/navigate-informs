The SubJCIR’s jump component includes two-sided mean-reverting (state-dependent) jumps. The process remains strictly positive if the CIR process satisfies Feller’s condition. The analytical tractability of the SubJCIR process makes it a richer extension to the JCIR process (compared to previous models) and it is also a natural alternative for interest rates and credit models.</br>
