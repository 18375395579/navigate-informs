The exploration-  exploitation tradeo? is represented by the decision to allocate scarce resources between learning about the system parameters to improve future  decisions and choosing actions that contribute most to the total expected reward. This work is motivated by the challenges survey organizations are faced with in the attempt to increase the quality of survey estimates.</br>
