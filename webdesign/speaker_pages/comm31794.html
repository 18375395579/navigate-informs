Title: A Capacity Reservation Scheme for Outpatient Scheduling at the Mayo Clinic<br>Author: Jivan Deglise-Hawkinson, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, jivan@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Helm, Todd Huschka, David Kaufman, Thomas Rohleder, Mark Van Oyen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Mayo Clinic currently uses a decentralized approach to reserve appointment capacity for different types of patients. This often results in blocking for internal referral visits between medical departments and in less than desired access to care for some patients. Our capacity planning model optimizes a booking plan that allows proper access by patient type, accounts for physicians?preferences, and forecasts patients?future resource needs in each department to reduce internal blocking.
