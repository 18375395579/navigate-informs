Title: Bidding in Online Slot Auctions<br>Author: Kartik Hosanagar, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, PA, kartikh@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Cherapanov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study optimal bidding in slot auctions run by search engines. These auctions are run as variants of second-price auctions but have been shown to be incentive incompatible. Thus advertisers have to be strategic about bidding. We present an analytical model to characterize the optimal bidding strategy and illustrate its application using real-world data. We find that the proposed strategies are very effective in practice.
