Title: Agent-Based Modeling of Mass Egress After Disasters<br>Author: Doug Samuelson, Principal Decision Scientist, Serco-NA, 8711 Chippendale Court, Annandale, VA, 22003, United States of America, samuelsondoug@yahoo.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We summarize and review recent work in agent-based simulation of mass egress and evacuation after a disaster.  Technical advances make it possible to model large crowds fairly realistically in real time.  Issues remaining to be addressed by recent work include variations in movement speeds, group behaviors, counter-flow due to arriving rescue personnel, factors that change urgency and cooperation, and effects of secondary events such as smoke and debris plumes.
