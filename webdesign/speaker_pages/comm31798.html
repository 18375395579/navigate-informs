Title: Contrasting Decision Models for Different Adversary Groups<br>Author: Heather Rosoff, Research Assistant Professor, University of Southern California, CREATE, RTH-315, MC-2902, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-2902, United States of America, rosoff@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Richard John<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Terrorists and other adversaries generally have multiple and conflicting objectives that underlie attack motivations. For two separate terrorists groups, we have looked at the value structure, risk attitudes, trade-offs among conflicting objectives, and the estimated success probabilities for different attacks. In this presentation, we demonstrate model structure differences across the two groups, as well as report probabilistic estimates of attacker behavior for the two groups.
