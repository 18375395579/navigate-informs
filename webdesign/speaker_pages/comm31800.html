<br>Title: The Design of Incentive Compatible Mechanisms in Project Management</br><br>Author: Nicholas G. Hall, Ohio State University, 2100 Neil Avenue, 658 Fisher Hall, Columbus, OH, 43210-1144, United States of America, hall_33@fisher.osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Chen, Xiaotie Deng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Parkinson's Law often results in poor project performance. We describe an incentive compatible mechanism to resolve Parkinson's Law for projects planned under the critical path method. We describe an incentive compatible mechanism to resolve Parkinson's Law for projects planned under critical chain project management. We develop an incentive compatible mechanism for repeated projects. A computational study shows that our scheme provides significant improvement in typical project performance.</br>
