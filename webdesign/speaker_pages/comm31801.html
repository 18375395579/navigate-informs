Title: On the Development of Dynamic Ad-hoc Protocols<br>Author: Timothy Matis, Texas Tech University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Lubbock, Tx, United States of America, timothy.matis@ttu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: There have been many recent statistical studies examining the influence of environmental factors on the performance of established link and MAC layer protocols.  We illustrate many of these and propose new directions towards the development of dynamics adjustments to optimize end-to-end performance measures.
