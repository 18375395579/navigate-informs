Title: Algorithmic Generation of Strategies for Huge Imperfect-information Games- Applied to Texas Hold’em<br>Author: Tuomas Sandholm, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Department, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, sandholm+@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Javier Pena, Andrew Gilpin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: I will overview the recent developments in my group’s multi-year research agenda of automatically creating game-theoretic strategies for huge sequential imperfect-information games.  I will cover our newest automated abstraction techniques and equilibrium-finding techniques, among other component technologies.  Applications to Heads-Up Limit and No-Limit Texas Hold’em will be presented.
