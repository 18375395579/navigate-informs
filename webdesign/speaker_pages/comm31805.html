Many commercial packages are available, but they come with both a financial and an intellectual cost. An alternative is to teach the course using Open Source software.  In this paper, we present the experience of using several different Open Source software packages in the classroom. This discussion includes the potential benefits as well as some of the problems that may result from their use.</br>
