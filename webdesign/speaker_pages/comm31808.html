<br>Title: Emergency Resources Allocation for Disaster Response: An Evolutionary Approach</br><br>Author: Mohammed Muaafa, PhD Candidate, Stevens Institute of Technology, 4501 Bergenwood Ave, North Bergen, NJ, 07047, United States of America, muaafa@hotmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jose Emmanuel Ramirez-Marquez, Ana Lisbeth Concho</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The high volume of potential casualties and urgency of a fast response increase the complexity of a disaster response mission and the need for developing an effective and efficient disaster response strategy. The research focuses on finding optimal emergency medical response strategies characterized by: locations of temporary emergency units, dispatching strategies of emergency vehicles, and number of victims to be evacuated. The objectives are to minimize response time and cost of the strategy.</br>
