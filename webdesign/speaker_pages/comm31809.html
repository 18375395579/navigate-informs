Title: OGDF- The Open Graph Drawing Framework<br>Author: Carsten Gutwenger, Dortmund University of Technology, Otto-Hahn-Str. 14, Dortmund, --, 44227, Germany, carsten.gutwenger@cs.uni-dortmund.de<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Graph drawing has now grown for several decades and a huge amount of algorithms has been proposed. Many of these algorithms build upon complex data structures and further algorithms, thus making new implementations from scratch cumbersome and time-consuming. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive libraries with publicly available source-code restricted the understanding of implementations considerably. This motivated the development of OGDF, an open source C++ library for drawing graphs.
