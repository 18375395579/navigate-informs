Title: The Value of Congestion<br>Author: Laurens Debo, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, laurdebo@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christine Parlour, Uday Rajan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We provide a model in which a queue for a good communicates the quality of the good to consumers. Agents observe the queue length and a private signal (good or bad) about the good. We find that under specified conditions, both a high quality firm and a social planner maximizing consumer surplus prefer a low service rate to a high one, due to the information externality.
