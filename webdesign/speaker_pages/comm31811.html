Title: Maintenance Diagnostics, Prognostics and Health Management in Manufacturing<br>Author: Stephan Biller, Group Manager, General Motors R&D, 30500 Mound Road, MC 480-106-359, Warren, MI, 48090, United States, stephan.biller@gm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Leandro Barajas<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Maintenance generates one of the highest structural costs in automotive manufacturing. Reducing such costs can achieve results beyond those possible by implementing efficiency improvement programs alone. By integrating diagnostics and prognostics into our maintenance business processes, we have reduced spacio-temporal uncertainties associated with future states and performance of manufacturing systems and therefore enabling us to take informed and effective decisions on maintenance activities.
