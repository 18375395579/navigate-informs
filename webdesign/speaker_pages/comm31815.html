In this study, we investigate the impact of network social capital on value of software innovation. Based on empirical analysis on software patents data, we find that the count of quality weighted external direct contacts of a team and regional diversity of contacts significantly influence the value of innovation while the count of quality weighted external indirect contacts of a team has no significant impact.
