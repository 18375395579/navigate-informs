Title: The Information Security Repercussions of the Sourcing of Healthcare Technology<br>Author: Sam Ransbotham, Asst Professor, Boston College, Boston, MA, United States of America, sam.ransbotham@bc.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Healthcare systems invite security attacks. Each healthcare transaction requires that detailed, private and valuable data be exchanged by many interconnected firms, providing many opportunities for weak links. Unfortunately, there is little empirical research that specifically examines these attacks. Preliminary analysis suggests that strategic decisions about technology sourcing have important security implications not only for the firm adopting the technology but for partner firms as well.
