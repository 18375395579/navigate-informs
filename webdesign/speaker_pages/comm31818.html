We find (1) learning-curve heterogeneity exists for both individual and team experience; (2) learning from team experience depends on familiarity between team members who have to closely coordinate tasks; (3) when we allow for learning-curve heterogeneity for individuals and teams, organizational experiences is not significant.</br>
