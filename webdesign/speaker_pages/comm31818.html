Title: The Impact of Learning-curve Heterogeneity and Team Familiarity on Orthopedic Procedure Times<br>Author: Michael Lapr? Vanderbilt University, Owen Graduate School of Management, 401 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN, 37203, United States of America, Michael.Lapre@owen.vanderbilt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Moore<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study orthopedic procedure times. We find (1) learning-curve heterogeneity exists for both individual and team experience; (2) learning from team experience depends on familiarity between team members who have to closely coordinate tasks; (3) when we allow for learning-curve heterogeneity for individuals and teams, organizational experiences is not significant.
