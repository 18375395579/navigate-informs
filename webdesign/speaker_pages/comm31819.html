Title: Diagnosing Unforeseeable Uncertainty in Startups<br>Author: Christoph Loch, Professor of Technology Management, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, France, christoph.loch@insead.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Novel startups often face unforeseeable uncertainty, or influence factors that cannot be identified beforehand. However, management systems (e.g., whether to proceed with parallel trials or by probing and learning) must be set at the outset. This contradiction can be resolved by asking for gaps and inconsistencies in one’s knowledge: the PRESENCE of unforeseeable uncertainty can be diagnosed. The extent of uncertainty and complexity allow guidance in choosing the management systems.
