<br>Title: The Truth about Metagenomics</br><br>Author: J. Paul Brooks, Virginia Commonwealth University, PO Box 843083, Richmond, VA, United States of America, jpbrooks@vcu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The human microbiome is the community of microbes that populate habitats on and around various body sites. The processing of DNA from microbiome samples introduces bias so that the relative quantities of bacteria that are observed are a distortion of the true population composition.  Designed experiments and computational modeling identify sources of bias, quantify their impact, and facilitate the testing of specific hypotheses about the microbiome and disease.</br>
