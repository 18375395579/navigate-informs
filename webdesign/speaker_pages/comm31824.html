<br>Title: Real Metrics: Using Real Program Value for Development Program Management</br><br>Author: Murray Cantor, Distinguished Engineering, IBM Software Group, 340 W. 72nd Street, Apt. 6A, New York, NY, 10023, United States, mcantor@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Classical program management measures such as ‘earned value?do not account for the statistical nature of the program variables and so do not drive behavior that drives program success. In this talk, I discuss the use of the Datar and Mathews Real Program Value measures to derive a set of program development measures, Real Metrics that drive effective development management, enable staged program investment, and provide a means for evaluating development organization value creation.</br>
