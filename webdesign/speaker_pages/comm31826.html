<br>Title: Factors Affecting the Turnover Times between Surgeries</br><br>Author: David P. Strum, Associate Professor, Hospital University of Pennsylvania, 680 Dulles, Hospital U of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, strumdp@uphas.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Luis G. Vargas</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Surgical scheduling is complicated by variability inherent in the turnover times (TT) between surgeries.  We investigated TT with the goal to describe variability in TT and the associated factors that might be predicted, controlled, or altered to improve surgical scheduling.  Our results suggest numerous factors affect turnover times and knowledge of the sources of variability in TT are important to improve surgical scheduling and reduce sub-optimal utilization of costly operating rooms.</br>
