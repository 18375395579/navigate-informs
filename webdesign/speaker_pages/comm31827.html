Campus Center Drive, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States, mgtwt@business.utah.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Don Wardell<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We developed a Visual Basic Application driven Excel spreadsheet that is built around one simple business scenario that allows students to integrate the Central Limit Theorem, interval estimation and hypothesis testing.  Moreover, the example demonstrates several useful Excel statistical formulae.  The results of an in-class open-book quiz showed that the scores of those using the interactive demo were superior to those exposed to more traditional techniques at the 10% significance level.
