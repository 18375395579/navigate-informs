Title: Weather for Combat Models:  Methodology, Techniques and Results<br>Author: Richard Shirkey, Dr., Army Research Laboratory, Attn: AMSRD-ARL-CI-EM, WSMR, NM, 88002, United States of America, rshirkey@arl.army.mil<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Techniques have been developed that allow significant improvement in weather effects and impacts for combat models.  Parametric curves were constructed to represent infrared sensors acquiring targets under specified weather conditions in conjunction with environmental impact thresholds for determination of go/no-go weather situations for platforms or systems.  We found that the wargame realism was increased without impacting run time.  Results were verified using AWARS.
