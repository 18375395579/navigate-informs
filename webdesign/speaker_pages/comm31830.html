Title: Integrated Soldier Situational Awareness/ Search and Target Acquisition Modeling<br>Author: John Willis, LTC, United States Military Academy, Dept. of Systems Engineering, Mahan Hall, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, john.willis@usma.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This work seeks to identify capability gaps and Soldier M&S analysis needs for the interrelated concepts of Situational Awareness (SA) and Search and Target Acquisition (STA).  Our research objectives are to: (1) Identify and evaluate Soldier SA and STA representation within current M&S; (2) Develop an understanding of the interrelationships between Soldier SA and STA; and (3) Develop algorithms and implementations to represent SA and its impacts on STA with a focus on IWARS, OOS, and COMBATXXI.
