Our research objectives are to: (1) Identify and evaluate Soldier SA and STA representation within current M&S; (2) Develop an understanding of the interrelationships between Soldier SA and STA; and (3) Develop algorithms and implementations to represent SA and its impacts on STA with a focus on IWARS, OOS, and COMBATXXI.</br>
