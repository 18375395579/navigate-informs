<br>Title: Complementary Capabilities in Dynamic Environments: The Evolution of Services in IT Product Firms</br><br>Author: Phillip Anderson, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 1206 S. 6th Street, Champaign, IL, United States of America, philca@illinois.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This dissertation explores the fast-paced IT product industry that rewards firms for innovation and fast growth, yet some firms have altered their strategic positioning in services as exhibited by a few multibillion dollar acquisitions in recent years. This signal suggests that the innovator has strategic options beyond the classic product-process innovation models. With data on 300+ firms from 1987-2008 and two case studies, I examine how this services phenomenon emerges and evolves.</br>
