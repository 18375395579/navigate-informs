Title: Multi-stage Stochastic Program in Capacity Planning and Technology Acquisition<br>Author: Lila Rasekh, Disney, Lila.rasekh@gmail.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Manufacturing flexibility is recognised as one of the key strategies to address uncertain future products demand. Therefore, a growing need  exists to investigate the strategic aspect of flexibility. To capture the different aspects of market flexibility in the face of this  dynamic demand, this talk focuses on the role of product, volume, and expansion flexibility in the context of the multi-stage stochastic program.
