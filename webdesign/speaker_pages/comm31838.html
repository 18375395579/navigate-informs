<br>Title: Contract Crew Forecasting Models and Potential Agency Cost Savings</br><br>Author: Geoffrey Donovan, USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, 620 SW Main St. Suite 400, Portland, OR, 97205, United States, gdonovan@fs.fed.us</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Suppressing wildfires requires significant funds for inputs in advance of uncertain fire seasons. The benefits of improved information about the severity of an upcoming season can be quantified using ex post analyses. We report the potential gains to the U.S. Forest Service of using a new forecasting method that exploits historical information about cost-minimizing input choices for type II hand crews. Our analysis documents that potential gains far outweigh their research and development costs.</br>
