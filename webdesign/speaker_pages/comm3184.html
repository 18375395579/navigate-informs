Title: An Adaptive Sampling Strategy for Online High-dimensional Process Monitoring with Limited Resources<br>Author: Kaibo Liu, Ph.D Candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, kbliu@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yajun Mei, Jianjun Shi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Temporally and spatially dense data-rich environments provide unprecedented opportunities and challenges for process control. This research proposes an adaptive sampling strategy with only limited resources available at each acquisition time for online high-dimensional process monitoring. A monitoring scheme of using the sum of top-r local detection statistics is developed. Case studies are performed on a hot forming and a real solar flare process.
