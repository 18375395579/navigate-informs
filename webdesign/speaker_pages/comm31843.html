Title: To Do or Not To Do—That is the Decision to be Modeled<br>Author: Kerry Moores, Assistant Professor, United States Military Academy, 646 Swift Road, Thayer Hall, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, kerry.moores@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Heather Stevenson, Jong Chung<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We will present several Dynamic Decision Networks (DDNs). DDNS are ideal for decision makers faced with multiple uncertain variables, conflicting objectives, and many opportunities to collect information. Our DDNs model routine decisions that will be made by leaders who will operate FCS platforms to include the Infantry Carrier Vehicle and the non line of sight (NLOS) weapon system, and who will maintain equipment under the Future Warrior concept. All of the developed models are scenario driven and are not based on any classified information pertaining to the new platforms.
