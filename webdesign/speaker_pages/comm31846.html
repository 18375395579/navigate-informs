<br>Title: The History of OR as a Study of Method</br><br>Author: William Thomas, Graduate Student, Harvard University, 1 Oxford Street, History of Science Department, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States, thomas@fas.harvard.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Some OR practitioners are fond of referring to the early wartime history of the discipline: OR as Blackett and Morse did it.  Assuming the field has progressed, why are these roots still considered important?  Drawing on early military studies and work done at MIT and Arthur D. Little, I emphasize the importance then attached to the freeform study of extant operational method as a hallmark of creative and vital work, rather than the application of some peculiar OR methodology.</br>
