Title: Weather and Operational Performance<br>Author: George Tam, Undergraduate Student, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, gtam@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Weather plays a direct role in airline performance, but also plays many complex and subtle indirect roles as well. We present our development of a large database comprised of exhaustive flight and weather data for a ten year period and discuss our preliminary analyses. Our long-term goal is to enable better forecasting of weather impacts on network performance and predictions to enable improved interventions and recovery actions.
