<br>Title: An Enterprise Computational System Built on the Optimization Services (OS) Framework and Standards</br><br>Author: Jun Ma, Postdoctoral Fellow, Northwestern University, Department of Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States, maj@northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Optimization Services (OS) is a unified framework and a set of open source standards (under the CPL license) for building Comutational and Optimization software both as standalone and over distributed systems. In this talk we present an professional implementation and deployment of large scale enterprise computational system that is based on the OS standards and fit for scheduling computational jobs over both Internet and Intranet.</br>
