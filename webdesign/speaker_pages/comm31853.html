Title: Application and Evaluation of Bibliometrics Methods for ATM Researches<br>Author: Hidenori Chida, University of Tokyo, Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan, hidenori.chida@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Katsuhiro Nishinari, Hiroko Nakamura<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Innovation in ATM (air traffic management) is expected to afford rapidly increasing air traffic more efficiently and safely. To implement the innovation, interdisciplinary cooperation is required in ATM researchers such as with civil engineering or navigation research of other transportation. Therefore, we applied and evaluated a bibliometrics method to get overviews of areas unknown to ATM researchers, and to support effective and strategic ATM development.
