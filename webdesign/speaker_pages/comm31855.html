<br>Title: Implications of a Population Health Focus on Clinic Metrics and Models</br><br>Author: Sandra Potthoff, Professor, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States of America, potth001@UMN.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diwakar Gupta</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Medical homes and service line management are strategies that healthcare systems are implementing as care moves to the clinic setting.  These changes are driven by reimbursement models with a population health focus.  As clinic managers face these changes, they need metrics that assess case mix adjusted total cost of care across the healthcare supply chain.  We review current clinic level metrics/models, and discuss new ones to consider given reimbursement and clinic operational changes.</br>
