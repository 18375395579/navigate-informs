Title: Using Mathematical Modeling to Investigate Marginal Cost-effectiveness of Childhood Vaccinations<br>Author: Michael Harvey, PhD Student, University of Michigan, 1415 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor, Mi, 48109-2029, United States of America, harveymj@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Hutton, Lisa Prosser<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The number of ACIP recommended childhood immunizations has increased in the last decade. This increase is associated with change in coverage levels for some immunizations. Given this, there is interest in determining how coverage changes impact cost-effectiveness of vaccination. A theoretical SIR model was created and applied to recommended vaccines to investigate marginal coverage changes and the corresponding changes in effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in order to optimize coverage levels.
