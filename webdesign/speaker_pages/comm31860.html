Title: Stage Time Reductions in NPD Cycles:  Context-Specific Impacts on Market Gains and Strategic Caveats<br>Author: Raul Chao, University of Virginia, Darden School of Business, Charlottesville, VA, United States of America, chaor@darden.virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elliot Bendoly<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We empirically investigate how time reductions in particular product development stages impact market value.  Using longitudinal project data from 107 firms, we compare stage times prior to and following investments in NPD process changes.  Our analysis reveals a predominance of focus on time reduction in the late stages of product development, and the existence of an inverted-U relationship between market performance and time reductions for some stages.
