Using longitudinal project data from 107 firms, we compare stage times prior to and following investments in NPD process changes.  Our analysis reveals a predominance of focus on time reduction in the late stages of product development, and the existence of an inverted-U relationship between market performance and time reductions for some stages.</br>
