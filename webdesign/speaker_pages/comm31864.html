Title: Demand Management: Options for Ensuring the Efficient Use of Scarce Airport Capacity<br>Author: David Gillen, Professor, University of British Columbia, Sauder School of Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z2, Canada, david.gillen@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: I provide an assessment of alternative strategies for allocating scarce airport capacity. I include quantitative and qualitative measures. An important difference between the two approaches is prices allocate capacity on the basis of willingness to pay while slot restrictions require a method of allocation. I identify key efficiency and equity issues focusing mostly on market based mechanisms and provide summary tables of the impacts of different approaches as well as their benefits and costs.
