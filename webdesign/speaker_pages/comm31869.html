<br>Title: Simulating Resource Allocation at The Ottawa General Hospital: A System Dynamics Approach</br><br>Author: Sonia Vanderby, PhD Candidate, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, sonia@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Carter</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this study, a simulation was constructed using system dynamics to determine what could be done to alleviate the pressure within the Ottawa General Hospital’s ED.  The goal of this model is to enable scenario testing through altering demand patterns as well as resource levels and distribution.  It provides a high-level image of the potential outcomes of various resource allocation decisions, enabling hospital administrators to make informed decisions and forecast for future demand.</br>
