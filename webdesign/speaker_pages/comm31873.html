<br>Title: An SI Model with Behavioral Feedback and Trajectories That Reach a DNSS Point in Positive Time</br><br>Author: Irmgard Zeiler, Post-doctoral fellow, Department of Mathematical Methods in Economics, Vienna University of Technology, Argentinierstrasse 8/105-4, Vienna, A-1040, Austria, irmgard.zeiler@gmx.net</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan P. Caulkins, Dieter Grass, Gernot Tragler</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We apply optimal dynamic control to a standard epidemiological SI-model augmented to include behavioral change in the incidence rate and parameterized for HIV. The solution is substantively provocative and manifests an interesting new type of threshold behavior not previously reported in the optimal control literature.</br>
