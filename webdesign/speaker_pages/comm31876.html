Once aircraft rotations are disrupted, plans must be updated to comply with regulations for aircraft maintenance. We address this issue by providing pre- and post-disruption strategies to stay compliant with regulations through our maintenance planning and recovery framework. We present results that illustrate the effectiveness of our optimization strategy and its impact on an airline's short-term maintenance planning process.</br>
