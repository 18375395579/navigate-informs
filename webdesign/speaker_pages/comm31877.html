Title: Quantifying Adversary Capabilities to Inform Target-hardening Decisions<br>Author: Chen Wang, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 3239 Mechanical Engineering, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, cwang37@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vicki Bier<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We fill a gap in the game-theoretic literature for homeland security by the explicit consideration of adversary capabilities in addition to just intent. We propose a novel Bayesian Stackelberg game to capture the effects of adversary capabilities by using contest success functions from economics. We also allow the effectiveness of attacker capabilities to differ across targets (e.g., civilian vs. military) and attack modes (e.g., attacks using improvised explosive devices vs. nuclear weapons).
