Title: Marks of Distinction: Style as a Source of Status among Security Analysts, 1986-2005<br>Author: Simona Giorgi, Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, s-giorgi@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Klaus Weber<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The study examines the performative basis of status in occupational communities, status that derives from the style with which an actor performs a job. We examine status dynamics among securities analysts specializing in biotechnology using text analysis of analysts' reports. We find that stylistic elements such as the rhetorical packaging of reports are associated with status if they resonate with audience values.
