Title: Exploring the Sources of Default Clustering<br>Author: Gustavo Schwenkler, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, United States of America, gschwenk@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kay Giesecke, Shahriar Azizpour<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop goodness-of-fit testing and prediction for event timing models in which the arrival intensity is influenced by past events and incompletely observed covariates. Applying these tools to US defaults between 1970 and 2012, we find that there is significant default contagion after controlling for macro-economic covariates and an unobserved frailty that prior studies have identified as predictors of US defaults. Both frailty and contagion are significant sources of default clustering.
