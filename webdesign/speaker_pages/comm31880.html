<br>Title: Modeling and Exploiting Adversary Risk Attitudes and Trade-offs Among Conflicting Objectives</br><br>Author: Richard John, Associate Professor of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, richardj@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Heather Rosoff</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Terrorists and other adversaries generally have multiple and conflicting objectives that underlie attack motivations. We describe defender strategies that explicitly model attacker risk attitudes and attacker trade-offs among conflicting objectives. We also report on behavioral lab studies that assess the fit of these attacker models, and compare the performance of competing defender strategies that explicitly account for attacker risk attitudes and trade-offs.</br>
