Title: Dynamic User Equilibrium and Stable System States in Transportation Networks<br>Author: Gitakrishnan Ramadurai, PhD Student, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, JEC 4002 Dept of Civil and Environmental, Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, ramadg@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The paper will focus on the properties of dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) and stable system states in transportation networks under both non-atomic and discrete individuals?assumptions. Stable system states arise when all users are better off compared to the DUE state and, therefore, have an incentive to continue in the state.
