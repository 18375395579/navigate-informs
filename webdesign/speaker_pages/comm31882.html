The main result is that with limited commitment, the manager extends the project as it progresses, which induces the agents to work less, thus rendering all parties worse off. We show that the manager should delegate the choice of the requirements to the agents or foster a relatively uncooperative environment within the team unless she has sufficient commitment power.</br>
