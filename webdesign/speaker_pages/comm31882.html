Title: Optimal Project Size in the Presence of Moral Hazard in Teams and Limited Commitment<br>Author: George Georgiadis, University of California-Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, georgiadis@ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Lippman, Christopher Tang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the interaction between a team of agents who work to complete a project and a manager who selects its requirements. The main result is that with limited commitment, the manager extends the project as it progresses, which induces the agents to work less, thus rendering all parties worse off. We show that the manager should delegate the choice of the requirements to the agents or foster a relatively uncooperative environment within the team unless she has sufficient commitment power.
