As a result, it is not uncommon to witness major manufacturers discontinuing a product shortly after its introduction. In this talk, we consider a seller who first tests the market and learns more about the demand before deciding whether or not to launch a product (or set of products). We also discuss current e-commerce practices that have increase companies' ability to do such market testing.
