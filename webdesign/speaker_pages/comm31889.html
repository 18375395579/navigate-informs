Title: Vehicle Replacement in the International Committee of the Red Cross?ICRC<br>Author: Alfonso Pedraza Martinez, Alfonso.pedrazamartinez@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Luk Van Wassenhove<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study vehicle replacement within the ICRC, one of the largest humanitarian organisations in the world. This research focuses on the fleet of 700 4x4 vehicles in Ethiopia, Sudan, Georgia and Afghanistan, 4 countries that cover most of the ICRC operational spectrum. ICRC policy sets the replacement of vehicles at 5 years or 150000 Km. Using real data provided by the ICRC headquarters, we test the current policy and find that it is not optimal from a cost perspective. We analyse the operational lifecycle of vehicles using econometric models and dynamic programming. Our results suggest that the organisation can make considerable savings by adjusting their replacement policy. This study contributes to the area of transportation research in humanitarian operations.
