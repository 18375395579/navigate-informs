<br>Title: Choices and Outcomes:  The Effects of Improvement Project Portfolio Choices</br><br>Author: Anita Tucker, Assistant Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 551 Huntsman Hall, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19066, United States, tuckera@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Bohmer, Ingrid Nembhard</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Healthcare organizations strive to improve the quality of care they deliver. For many, the first step is to develop a portfolio of improvement projects. We present data from 44 intensive care units that created such portfolios by selecting among 93 practices they had collaboratively developed. We examine the effects of three portfolio choices - number of practices, type of practices and project team - and interactions among choices, on patient length of stay, infection rates and mortality.</br>
