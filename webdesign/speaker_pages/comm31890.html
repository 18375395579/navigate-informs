<br>Title: Creating Network Capacity Through Operational Changes</br><br>Author: David Hunt, Senior Specialist, Oliver Wyman, One University Square, Suite 100, Princeton, NJ, 08550, United States of America, david.hunt@oliverwyman.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc Meketon</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: If costs were not an issue, adding more rail track would be an easy solution to increasing line capacity.  Since costs are always an issue, rail planners have become very creative when faced with a corridor that is near or at capacity.  This presentation will discuss the expected gain in capacity for various non-infrastructure options, provide some thoughts on how to select between the options, and explore how these options impact efforts to define and model rail capacity.</br>
