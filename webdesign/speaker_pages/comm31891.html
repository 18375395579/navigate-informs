Title: Condition-based Maintenance for Degrading Systems under Dynamic Environments<br>Author: Xiao Liu, Qatar University, Male Library, Room 103, Doha, 2713, Qatar, liuxiaodnn_1@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Khalifa N. Al-Khalif, Abdel Magid Hamouda, Dingguo Hua, David Coit, Elsayed Elsayed<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This talk presents an optimum condition-based maintenance policy for degrading systems under dynamic environments. The degradation is described by a Wiener process with both degradation rate and diffusion being influenced by system age and environment condition. We obtain the distribution of the remaining system life, based on which the dynamic CBM decisions are made.
