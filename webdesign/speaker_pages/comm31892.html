Title: Decision Diagrams and Dynamic Programming<br>Author: John Hooker, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, jh38@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Binary and multivalued decision diagrams are related to dynamic programming (DP) but differ in some important ways. This talk incorporates DP with state-dependent costs into the theory of decision diagrams and generalizes a well-known uniqueness theorem for reduced diagrams.  This can lead to simplification of DP models by transforming the costs to “canonical?costs and reducing the diagram, as illustrated by a standard inventory management problem.
