Our goal is to maximize the expected profits of the accepted projects within a finite planning horizon. The way in which projects are planned affects their payout time and as a consequence, the reinvestment revenues, as well as the available capacity for future arriving projects. Simulation experiments compare the performance of our procedures to a baseline heuristic, commonly used in practice.</br>
