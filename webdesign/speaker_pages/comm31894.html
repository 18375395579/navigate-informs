Title: Heuristics for Order Acceptance and Capacity Planning<br>Author: Jade Herbots, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, FETEW, KBI, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, BE-3000, Belgium, jade.herbots@econ.kuleuven.be<br>Coauthor(s): Willy Herroelen, Roel Leus, Erik Demeulemeester<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate order acceptance and capacity planning under limited regular and non-regular resources. Our goal is to maximize the expected profits of the accepted projects within a finite planning horizon. The way in which projects are planned affects their payout time and as a consequence, the reinvestment revenues, as well as the available capacity for future arriving projects. Simulation experiments compare the performance of our procedures to a baseline heuristic, commonly used in practice.
