Understanding patient preference in medical appointments is crucial in managing such appointment systems. In this study we designed and conducted a discrete choice experiment to elicit patient preference in a large urban community health center. Our study generates insights on how patients choose appointments when facing multiple alternatives, and what factors drive patients to make such choices.
