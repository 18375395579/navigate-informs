<br>Title: Waiting Patiently: An Empirical Study of Queue Abandonment in an Emergency Department</br><br>Author: Robert Batt, Assissant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 975 University Ave., Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, batt@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study abandonment from an emergency department queue and find that patients are influenced by what they observe in the waiting room: census, arrivals, and departures. Patients also make inferences about the severity of the patients around them and respond differently to people sicker and less sick moving through the system. These results show that in order to reduce patient abandonment, hospitals should carefully manage what information patients have regarding their wait.</br>
