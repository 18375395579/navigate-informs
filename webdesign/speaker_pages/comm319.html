Title: Reducing Surgical Site Infections<br>Author: Eva Lee, Professor and Director, Industrial and Systems Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, eva.lee@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ling Ling<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This project is joint with Grady Memorial Hospital. Surgical-site infections (SSI) are a national problem, occurring in an estimated 2.8% of all procedures (for some, it is up to 30%). It causes complication, prolong length and stay and unnecessary burden on patients, hospitals and 3-party payers. We describe our recent successes in reducing SSI for coronary artery bypass graft through systems modeling and process optimization.
