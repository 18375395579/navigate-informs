There are several techniques   for measuring eye movement, the Infrared detection technique (IR),   Videooculography (VOG), Scleral eye coil and EOG. In this paper methods   for utilizing eye movement recordings towards controlling   neurodegenerative diseases as Parkinson's disease are presented and   evaluated  onto real datasets.</br>
