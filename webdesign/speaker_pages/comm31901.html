Title: Coordinating Search in Modular Systems: The Value of Temporary Integration<br>Author: Oliver Baumann, Research Associate and Ph.D Candidate, Institute for Information, Organization and Management, LMU Munich, Ludwigstr. 28, Munich, Germany, baumann@lmu.de<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: As complex systems are at best near-decomposable, decentralized search in modular structures requires coordination. Yet how much should efforts to provide for system-level fit constrain the independence of the module-level units, and what role do the specifics of the decomposition play? Using agent-based simulation, I suggest that intensive coordination is beneficial in the short-run, while module-level independence and punctuated system-level integration yield the highest long-run performance.
