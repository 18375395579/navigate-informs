Title: Optimal Maintenance of Multi-component Systems Considering Component Failure Dependency<br>Author: Qingyu William Yang, Assistant Professor, Wayne State University, 4815 Fourth Street, Rm 2167, Detroit, MI, 48335, United States of America, qyang@wayne.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nailong Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The interactions between components in multi-component systems complicate the modeling and optimization of maintenance. In this research, we develop optimal maintenance planning for multi-component systems that can capture component failure dependency. A case study of engine assembly system is conducted to verify the developed method.
