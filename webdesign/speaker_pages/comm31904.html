Title: USSOUTHCOM Channel Airlift Commercialization<br>Author: Carmen Oeltjen, Operations Research Analyst, Northrop Grumman, Joint Distribution Process Analysis Ctr, US Transportation Command, Scott AFB, IL, 62225, United States of America, Carmen.Oeltjen.ctr@ustranscom.mil<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: USTRANSCOM's JDPAC analysis team was asked to evaluate distribution options for USSOUTHCOM requirements currently moved by Channel air.  The requirement is small making reliable frequent service more challenging and costly as efficiencies normally attributed to volume may not be realized.  Cargo was examined to determine its eligibility for commercial movement, recognizing some items must remain on MILAIR.  The analysis resulted in an overall strategy customized for regional considerations.
