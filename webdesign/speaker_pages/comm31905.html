<br>Title: Online Advertising Response Models with Multiple Creatives and Impression Histories</br><br>Author: Michael Braun, Associate Professor of Marketing, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 100 Main St., E62-535, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, braunm@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wendy Moe</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Online advertising campaigns can consist of multiple ads with different creative content.  We propose a model that evaluates the impact of each ad impression on both visitation and conversion behavior. Our model allows for the accumulation, decay, wearout and restoration of advertising effects.  We show that online advertisers can increase the number of website visits and conversions by varying the creative content shown to an individual, according to that individual’s impression history.</br>
