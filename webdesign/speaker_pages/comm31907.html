An experiment was conducted in which respondents forecast demand and provide input to a planning meeting. Psychological traits are examined to analyze unintentional biases; different departmental roles and incentives (asymmetrical cost functions) are used to influence intentional biases. Various dynamic models are constructed and compared to assess the behavior of respondents.
