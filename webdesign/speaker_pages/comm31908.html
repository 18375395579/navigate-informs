Professor, The Marshall School of Business, Bridge Hall 401-P, 3670 Trousdale Parkway, Santa Monica, CA, 90403, United States of America, arunkund@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Praveen Pathak, Ying Liu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the global sourcing of business processes and investigate the factors that contribute to process complexity. We find that process complexity is highly subjective and perceptions of process complexity are driven by factors that have to do with task structure. We investigate the links between process complexity and operational risk based on panel data collected from field research.
