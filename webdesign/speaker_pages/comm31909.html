Title: Information Acquisition for Product Portfolio Selection<br>Author: Nektarios Oraiopoulos, University Lecturer in Operations Management, Judge Business School, Cambridge University, Trumptington St., Cambridge, United Kingdom, n.oraiopoulos@jbs.cam.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Jochen Schlapp, Vincent Mak<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Every product portfolio manager is challenged by the limited information that she has available when allocating resources across multiple products. Her task is further complicated when this information is obtained from self-interested managers who might have an incentive to be overly optimistic about their own products.  Our work studies how balancing individual and shared incentives can mitigate such inefficiencies and improve the product selection process.
