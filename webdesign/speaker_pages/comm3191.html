<br>Title: Long-run Productivity and Motivational Dynamics on an Open Crowdsourcing Platform</br><br>Author: Annika Mueller, Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States of America, amueller@fas.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karim Lakhani, Henry Sauermann, Kevin Boudreau</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study motivation and engagement of contributors on an open crowd-sourcing contest platform over a long period of time across a large number of contests. We find evidence of life-cycles of engagement which differ distinctly depending on contributors' primary source of motivation. The findings suggest that the long term management of crowd sourcing platforms involves more than just achieving a critical mass, namely managing dynamic motivations and attracting new generations of membership.</br>
