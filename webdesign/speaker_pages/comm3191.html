Title: Long-run Productivity and Motivational Dynamics on an Open Crowdsourcing Platform<br>Author: Annika Mueller, Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States of America, amueller@fas.harvard.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karim Lakhani, Henry Sauermann, Kevin Boudreau<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study motivation and engagement of contributors on an open crowd-sourcing contest platform over a long period of time across a large number of contests. We find evidence of life-cycles of engagement which differ distinctly depending on contributors' primary source of motivation. The findings suggest that the long term management of crowd sourcing platforms involves more than just achieving a critical mass, namely managing dynamic motivations and attracting new generations of membership.
