<br>Title: LocoSim: A Decision Support System for Simulating Locomotives</br><br>Author: Kamalesh Somani, CSX Transportation, Operations Research, 3019 Warrington Street, Jacksonville, FL, 32254, United States, Kamalesh_Somani@csx.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): F. Zeynep Sargut, Ravindra Ahuja, Artyom Nahapetyan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We have developed a locomotive simulation/optimization decision support system, LocoSim, that simulates a real-life environment in which train travel times are random variables, some trains may be cancelled or added, locomotives visit shops for quarterly maintenances or for breakdown repairs. LocoSim responds to these events intelligently by mimicing locomotive managers logic. This talk will present details of LocoSim as well as its computational results on real-life railroad data.</br>
