Title: A  Simulation Infrastructure for Procurement and Distribution<br>Author: Rick Wysk, Professor, Penn State University, Department of Industrial Engineering, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, rwysk@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jianrui (Jerry) Wang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Today’s warehouse and procurement centers face challenges in all aspects of service from procurement, to processing and logistics. This paper proposes a location based services infrastructure for forecasting, coordinating, and monitoring distributed simulation federations with real time location information. The infrastructure will significantly improve the performance of procurement and distribution, especially in case of critical needs such as nature disaster or terrorist attack.
