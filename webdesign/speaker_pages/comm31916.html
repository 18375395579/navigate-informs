Title: An Empirical Examination of Online Information Hiding in a Crowdfunding Context<br>Author: Gordon Burtch, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, burtc002@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anindya Ghose, Sunil Wattal<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We leverage large-scale proprietary data from a major crowdfunding platform to examine users?decisions to conceal contributions from public view. We find that this is more likely when users are privacy sensitive, under greater scrutiny or exhibiting “extreme?behavior. We also find evidence of an anchoring effect, which is eliminated when prior amounts are concealed. This is only beneficial when those amounts are small, so we discuss more nuanced approaches to the design of privacy controls.
