Title: Transparent Environments for Leaky Modules<br>Author: Jim Herbsleb, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, 5307 Wean Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, jdh@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laura Dabbish, Colleen Stuart, Jason Tsay<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Design rules enable concurrent work when organizational structure mirrors the technical architecture. Perfect modularity, however, is difficult to achieve. Imperfect modularity requires ongoing coordination of inter-module dependencies. In this qualitative study, we examine how an emerging generation of workspaces, explicitly designed around transparency, expose details of ongoing work and support surprisingly rich inferences about people, activities, technical direction, and dependencies.
