Title: Optimal Vote Trading<br>Author: David Hartvigsen, University of Notre Dame, Mendoza College of Business, Notre Dame, IN, 46556-5646, United States of America, dhartvig@nd.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Vote trading was used in the 2000 and 2004 US Presidential elections.  It is an Internet-based technique that (under the right conditions) allows, for example, Democrats in heavily Republican states (like Texas) to effectively (and legally) vote in swing states (like Florida), where their votes would have more impact.  We show how vote trading can be optimally implemented by showing its relationship to a knapsack problem.
