In the horse industry, the horseshoe is a path-dependent technology.  Most horses are shod with the steel keg shoe that has been the dominant design since the 1800s, despite widespread changes in how horses are owned, kept, and used, and alternative shoe designs.  Using survey data of horse owners, we explore how different social influence variables affected technology adoption decisions.</br>
