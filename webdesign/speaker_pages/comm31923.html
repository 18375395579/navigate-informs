Title: The Entrepreneur as David on Horseback<br>Author: Joseph Broschak, Associate Professor, University of Arizona, Eller College of Management, Dept. of Management & Organizations, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, broschak@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kenneth Koput<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate the role of social identity, information sources, and networks on new technology adoption.  In the horse industry, the horseshoe is a path-dependent technology.  Most horses are shod with the steel keg shoe that has been the dominant design since the 1800s, despite widespread changes in how horses are owned, kept, and used, and alternative shoe designs.  Using survey data of horse owners, we explore how different social influence variables affected technology adoption decisions.
