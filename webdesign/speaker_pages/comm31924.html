Title: Milk Supply Chain: Improving Quality under Competing Intermediaries<br>Author: Liying Mu, PhD Student, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 West Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, muliying@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Milind Dawande, Vijay Mookerjee<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Quality issues in milk - arising primarily from deliberate adulteration by producers - have been widely reported. High testing cost, free riding among producers, and competition between milk stations, are identified as the main causes for low milk quality. We examine confessor rewards, quality rewards, penalties, pre-mixed individual testing, and post-mixed individual testing. We propose a mechanism to incentivize high-quality milk from producers under minimal testing by stations.
