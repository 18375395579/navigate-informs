High testing cost, free riding among producers, and competition between milk stations, are identified as the main causes for low milk quality. We examine confessor rewards, quality rewards, penalties, pre-mixed individual testing, and post-mixed individual testing. We propose a mechanism to incentivize high-quality milk from producers under minimal testing by stations.</br>
