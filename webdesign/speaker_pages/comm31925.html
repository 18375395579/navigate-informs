Title: Parallel and Distributed Optimization in Comet<br>Author: Pascal Van Hentenryck, Professor of Computer Science, Brown University, Box 1910, 115 Waterman Street, 4th Floor, Providence, RI, 02912, United States, pvh@cs.brown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laurent Michel<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Distributed computing is increasingly important at a time when Moore's law cannot be sustained much longer. Unfortunately, it also places significant conceptual and implementation burden on programmers. This talk aims at addressing this challenge and presents abstractions that allows distributed optimization programs to be close to their sequential and parallel counterparts. A preliminary implementation Comet exhibits significant speed-ups.
