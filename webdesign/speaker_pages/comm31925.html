Unfortunately, it also places significant conceptual and implementation burden on programmers. This talk aims at addressing this challenge and presents abstractions that allows distributed optimization programs to be close to their sequential and parallel counterparts. A preliminary implementation Comet exhibits significant speed-ups.</br>
