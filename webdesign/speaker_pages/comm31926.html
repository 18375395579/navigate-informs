Title: VV&A of Large PMESII Simulations<br>Author: Dean Hartley, Hartley Consulting, 106 Windsong Ln, Oak Ridge, TN, 37830, United States of America, DSHartley3@comcast.net<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Simulations used to model nation building and other operations where political, military, economic, social, information, and infrastructure (PMESII) factors are relevant stretch the boundaries of scientific knowledge.  Consequently verifying, validating and accrediting (VV&A) are difficult tasks.  This presentation covers the results of a recent project for DARPA on VV&A of a large PMESII simulation.
