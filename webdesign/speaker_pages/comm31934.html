Title: GIMPy and GrUMPy: Visualization for Optimization in Python<br>Author: Ted Ralphs, Associate Professor, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, ted@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Osman Ozaltin, Michael O'Sullivan, Aykut Bulut<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk, we discuss two related libraries for visualizing a wide variety of optimization algorithms. The first is for visualizing standard graph algorithms, while the second is for visualizing tree search algorithms, such as branch and bound. We'll discuss the use of these two libraries both in teaching and research.
