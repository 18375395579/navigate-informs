Title: Decision under Uncertainty: Explicating the Roles of Perceived Riskiness and Perceived Ambiguity<br>Author: John Aloysius, Associate Professor, University of Arkansas, Information Systems Department, Fayetteville, AR, jaloysius@walton.uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fred Davis, Srinivasan Venkatraman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Riskiness and ambiguity are distinct dimensions of decision making under uncertainty, but their causal interplay as determinants of decision making has not been explicated. Four experiments confirmed our hypothesis that the influence of perceived ambiguity on decision behavior, is partially mediated through perceived riskiness. Studies 1, 2, and 3 manipulated ambiguity, and Study 4 manipulated riskiness to confirm its mediational role via an experimental-causal-chain design.
