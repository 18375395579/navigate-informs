Title: Multiple QoS in Service Composition<br>Author: Soundar Kumara, Pearce Professor of Industrial Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, 310 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, u1o@engr.psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): LiYing Cui<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A service network is a graph consisting of services and semantic concepts. Service composition is to form a compound workflow of services so that this compound workflow can execute complex tasks which cannot be done by an individual service. This research deals with multiple criteria of QoS (quality of services) in service composition. It compares six different scenarios.
