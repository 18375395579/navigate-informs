Title: Can Test-Driven Development (TDD) Work for Spreadsheet Engineering?<br>Author: Alan Rust, Postgraduate Research Student, Dundalk Institute of Technology, Dundalk, Ireland, alan.rust@dkit.ie<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin McDaid, Brian Bishop<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: It is widely accepted that the absence of a structured approach to spreadsheet engineering is a key factor in the high level of spreadsheet errors. This paper proposes and investigates the application of TDD to the creation of spreadsheets. Through a pair of case studies we demonstrate that TDD can be applied to the development of spreadsheets. A supporting tool under development is documented along with proposed research to determine the effectiveness of the methodology and the associated tool.
