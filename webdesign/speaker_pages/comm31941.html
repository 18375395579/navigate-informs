Title: Optimizing Manufacturing Validation Builds<br>Author: Daniel Reaume, Staff Researcher, General Motors Operations Research, M/C 480-106-155, 30500 Mound Road, Warren, MI, 48090, United States of America, daniel.reaume@gm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Hallie Kintner<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Manufacturing validation builds (MVBs) are an essential, but expensive, tool to ensure the launch of high-quality vehicles. We propose a hybrid model to optimize the number of such builds. The model recognizes the benefits of early issue detection and the fundamental differences between the automated and manual production processes involved in vehicle assembly.
