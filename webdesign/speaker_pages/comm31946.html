Title: Implementation of Energy Efficiency Initiatives: An Empirical Investigation<br>Author: Jason Nguyen, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, 321 19th Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, nguy1762@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karen Donohue, Rachna Shah<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a framework to predict energy efficiency implementation by firm and industry specific determinants, and test it using combined secondary data of 357 public traded firms. We ?nd that sub industry, integration of climate change into business strategy, and firm’s perceived opportunity are positively correlated with the probability to implement energy efficiency solutions, while firm’s size, environmental risk attitude and external communication do not seem to have any significant impact.
