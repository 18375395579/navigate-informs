<br>Title: Ambitious Goals and Stretched Resource Allocation: Managerial Biases under Innovation Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Jaime Andrés Castañeda, Universit?della Svizzera italiana (USI, Lugano), Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, Lugano, 6904, Switzerland, castanej@usi.ch</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nitin Joglekar, Paulo Gonçalves</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a stylized decision model based on the Newsvendor problem that incorporates the possibility of either setting ambitious design targets or stretched resource allocations goals. Experimental tests show that decision makers tend to overreact/underreact when costs and uncertainty call for less/more resources or ambitious scopes (pull-to-center effect) and to chase uncertainty thresholds realized in prior innovation efforts (threshold chasing), resembling common inventory-ordering biases.</br>
