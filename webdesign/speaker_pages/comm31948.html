Title: The Role of Trust in Intercompany Supply Chain Projects<br>Author: Ozalp Ozer, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, oozer@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andreas Brinkhoff, Ulrich Thonemann<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In recent years the importance of inter-company projects such as VMI or CPFR has strongly increased. There is a large body of literature on influence factors for innercompany projects such as Top-Management Commitment and on supply chain relationships. We combine these two research directions and analyze how the initial relationship between the project partners influences the project's outcome and present empirical evidence of over 100 sc-projects.
