Title: Planning for Optimal Liquidity Execution<br>Author: Wei Chen, Principal Product Manager, SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Dr., Cary, NC, 27512, United States of America, Wei.Chen@sas.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The challenging aspects of the recent regulation for liquidity risk are that banks must manage a hedging portfolio and frequently test its adequacy for liquidity exposures.  Banks need to strategize its response to liquidity crisis.  We propose a multi-stage linear program to optimize the liquidity execution. The optimization not only provides a solution in a distress but also helps build an a priori liquidity contingent plan. The model also helps banks prepare for non-sufficient CBC scenarios.
