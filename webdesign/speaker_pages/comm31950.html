One socio-economic implication of obesity is that it reduces automobile fuel economy. This research quantifies the amount of additional fuel consumed (annually) in the United States by automobiles that is attributable to higher average passenger weights, during the period from 1960 to 2002. The results indicate that approximately 938 million gallons of fuel are consumed annually as a result of obesity when measured from 1960.</br>
