Title: Fleet Management Coordination in Decentralized Humanitarian Operations<br>Author: Alfonso Pedraza Martinez, Indiana University, Kelley School of Business, Bloomington, IN, United States of America, alpedraz@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sameer Hasija, Luk Van Wassenhove<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by extensive field research we study incentive alignment to coordinate humanitarian operations. In large international humanitarian organizations efficiency/equity balancing headquarters assign operational capacity to equity-oriented programs. This creates a misalignment of incentives complicated by earmarked funding of vehicles.  We propose an operational mechanism design for system coordination.
