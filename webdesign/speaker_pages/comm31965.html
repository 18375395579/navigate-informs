Title: Understanding the Impact of Promotional Messages in Internet English Auctions<br>Author: Eric Greenleaf, Professor of Marketing, New York University, 40 West 4th Street, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, egreenle@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sha Yang, Caroline Ducarroz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Auctioneers often direct promotional messages at bidders and potential bidders during live and internet auctions. We model the impact of these messages on bidder behavior, auction prices, and future messages in the auction. We distinguish between informational and urging messages, propose that messages influence prices through dual paths, and that auctioneers issue messages depending on past auction events and messages. We test the model using data from real-time internet auctions.
