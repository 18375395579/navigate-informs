Title: Metrics for Risk and Resilience<br>Author: Igor Linkov, US Army Engineer Research & Development Center, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA, United States of America, Igor.Linkov@usace.army.mil<br>Coauthor(s): Zachary Collier<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Our increasingly complex decision-making environment is characterized by uncertainty regarding future events including natural hazards and man-made accidents, requiring a need for resilient systems. In order to design and manage resilience, there must be assessment of resilience (analytically derived through a set of key metrics). This presentation contrasts risk and resilience, and offers techniques leveraged from the field of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis for quantifying resilience.
