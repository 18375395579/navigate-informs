Title: New Developments in Tree-based Methods for Oncology<br>Author: Michael Leblanc, Member, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, M3-C102, Seattle, 98109, United States, mleblanc@fhcrc.org<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: New measures of patient and tumor biology and therapies targeted at specific biologic processes have led to heightened interest in the study of clinical outcomes in subgroups of patients based on molecular markers. In this talk, we investigate novel tree-based models for both main and interaction effects with molecular markers associated with the drug target. We demonstrate the new methods and discuss the impact on the design of future randomized studies.
