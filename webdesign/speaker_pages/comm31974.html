<br>Title: The “Nurseboy Problem? Nurse Staffing in the Presence of Absenteeism</br><br>Author: Sergei Savin, Associate Professor, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, svs30@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Linda Green, Nicos Savva</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Unpredictable patient volumes and needs make the identification of effective nurse staffing levels a major challenge for hospitals. This problem is compounded by significant levels of nurse absenteeism which can lead to high costs due to overtime and/or deterioration in patient care. We develop a nurse staffing model which incorporates absenteeism and propose effective staffing policies under several scenarios corresponding to different hospital environments.</br>
