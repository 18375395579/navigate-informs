Title: Political Engineering and Predicting the Outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election<br>Author: James Cochran, Louisiana Tech University, PO Box 10318, College of Business, Ruston, LA, 71272, United States of America, jcochran@cab.latech.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We treat determination of the optimal US Presidential platform as a share of choices problem. We utilize a maximal covering formulation with special ordered sets representing positions candidates on the issues. We project the winner by state, estimate variance and bias of projected Electoral College votes for each candidate, and assess sensitivity of each candidate’s support to changes in position on the issues. We also identify key issues and assess potential impact of a 3rd party candidate.
