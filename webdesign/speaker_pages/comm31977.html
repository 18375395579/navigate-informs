<br>Title: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks: Introduction to Research Problems</br><br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 4032 JEC, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, ukkuss@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lili Du</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This talk will introduce some challenging research problems in the emerging area of vehicular ad hoc networks. Specifically, we will discuss the challenges in the following problems - connectivity, reachability and network throughput. We will discuss results from connectivity in detail both from an analytical and simulation model.</br>
