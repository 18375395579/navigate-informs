Title: Productivity Based Incentives for Dynamic Work Allocation Systems<br>Author: J Rene Villalobos, Associate Professor, Arizona State University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States, rene.villalobos@asu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In dynamic work allocation systems such as bucket brigades faster workers perform a higher share of the total work content than slower workers do.  However, the long-term success of these systems is directly affected by the way that workers in the assembly line are compensated in terms of both, their individual effort and team effort.  In this talk we discuss some approaches to design incentive plans that best accommodate the characteristics of the different dynamic work allocation systems.
