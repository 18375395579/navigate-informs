Title: Spatiotemporally Adaptive Radiotherapy for Hypoxic Tumors<br>Author: Fatemeh Saberian, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States of America, saberian@uw.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Archis Ghate<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Lack of oxygen (hypoxia) decreases tumor radiosensitivity and hence can reduce treatment efficacy. We present a stochastic control approach to design treatment plans that adapt to spatiotemporal variations in hypoxia.
