<br>Title: Applications of Kitting Materials Feeding Policy to Healthcare: A Case Study in a Perioperative Services</br><br>Author: Lawrence J. Bonczar, MS Student, University of Virginia, 151 Engineer's Way, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States of America, lbonczar@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): K. Preston White</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Kitting involves the creation of kits of raw and sub-assembled components that in total amount to all of the material required for final assemblies. Most large hospitals assemble kits of instruments and disposable supplies for use during surgeries. The efficacy of the kitting process directly contributes to the quality of patient care during a surgical event. The paper reviews research on kitting as a materials feeding policy and applies it to a case study in a perioperative services department.</br>
