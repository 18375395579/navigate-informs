The difficulty in settling this question stems from the fact that, in most data sets, the type of search is not identified so researchers have to make an assumption regarding the specific search strategy being used. Using a unique data set on consumer shopping behavior in the U.S. auto insurance industry, we study the effects of making either assumption on the type of search.
