Variability in pathogens, human behaviors and characteristics, and measurement problems, all contribute to the difficulty of teasing out the impact of any one change to the system on HAI-rates. We use systems dynamics to illuminate how the sub-systems interact and lead to infections. We use data from the literature and guidance from infection control specialists to specify the model.</br>
