Title: A Systems Dynamics Model for Healthcare Acquired Infections<br>Author: Reidar Hagtvedt, Assistant Professor of Mgt Sci. & Stats., University of Alberta, 2-43 Business Building, Alberta School of Business, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R6, Canada, hagtvedt@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Sarah Forgie<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Healthcare Acquired Infections are complicated phenomena, despite the fact that every sub-problem is understood. Variability in pathogens, human behaviors and characteristics, and measurement problems, all contribute to the difficulty of teasing out the impact of any one change to the system on HAI-rates. We use systems dynamics to illuminate how the sub-systems interact and lead to infections. We use data from the literature and guidance from infection control specialists to specify the model.
