Title: Restocking: A Stitch in Time Saves Nine?<br>Author: Bo Li, Doctoral Student, Texas A&M University, 320M Wehner Bldg, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, bli@mays.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rogelio Oliva<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine how store manager actions (reactive activity and preventive activity) link to system/store performance in the inventory replenishment of a retail chain. We find that manager actions improve final performance and that reactive activity mediates the relationship between system performance and final performance. We also find that preventive activity are preferred to reactive activity due to workload constraint. Store managers are thus advised to intervene in the restocking decisions.
