Particularly, in investment projects that show a high level of managerial flexibility in conditions of uncertainty the assumption of a specific process can have an impact on the project value and the investment rule. This work discusses the choice of stochastic process in real options valuation and useful tests and theoretical considerations to give support to this task.</br>
