Title: Incorporating Undergraduates in Multidisciplinary Research Teams<br>Author: Amy Cohn, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, amycohn@umich.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: One of the key challenges of training undergraduate engineering students is to prepare them for facing open-ended problems.  Another challenge is to train them to communicate with non-engineers. We discuss our work with research teams that combine engineering undergraduates with medical students, residents, and clinicians.
