Title: Collocation Matters:The Interdependence of R&D and Manufacturing<br>Author: Enno Siemsen, University of Minnesota, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN, United States of America, siems017@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Gray, Gurneeta Vasudeva<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Does the collocation of manufacturing and research and development (R&D) activities improve or hurt manufacturing performance? We empirically show that the conformance-quality-related benefits from collocating manufacturing and R&D in the pharmaceutical industry generally dominate the drawbacks, and thus, collocated sites have superior manufacturing quality performance.
