Title: Mission Critical Spreadsheets at a Large Urban University: An Update<br>Author: Janet Wagner, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts-Boston, MSIS Department, 100 Morrissey Boulevard, Boston, MA, 02125, United States, janet.wagner@umb.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In 2003, we reported on a survey of the spreadsheet use across all departments of a large urban institution. Of particular interest in that study was the goal of the then-being-implemented Peoplesoft system to eliminate all parallel systems (many of them spreadsheets). We are now in 2006 and Peoplesoft is basically fully implemented at that institution. What was the effect on spreadsheet use?
