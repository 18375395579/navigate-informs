Title: Social Media and Firm Equity Value<br>Author: Jie Zhang, University of Texas Arlington, 701 S West St., Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, jiezhang@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xueming Luo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Companies have advocated social media to engage consumers and gauge product market performance. We empirically examine whether social media metrics are related to firm equity value. The results from the developed time-series models suggest that social media-based metrics (blogs and reviews) have higher predictive value for firm stock market performance compared to web traffic and search. We also find that firm stock performance responds faster to the social media-based metrics.
