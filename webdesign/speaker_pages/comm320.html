Title: Manipulating Privacy Valuations: Coherent Arbitrariness, Endowment Effects, and Willingness to Pay<br>Author: Leslie John, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Av, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, lkjohn@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alessandro Acquisti, George Loewenstein<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the impact of coherent arbitrariness and endowment effects on individuals' willingness to pay for privacy and willingness to accept money to reveal personal information. In four experiments, subjects had to choose between different types of trackable gift cards. We manipulated the initial endowment of the subjects as well as the framing and order of the offers they received. Our results suggest that privacy valuations are not stable and can be easily manipulated.
