For mid-  complexity and volume products, we have found that some manufacturers prefer to source locally while others source from lower cost countries. Complexity includes: size, capturing the density of the design network or the number of engineering specifications; frequency, quantifying how often and how much of the design is altered; precision, measuring tightness of design specifications. We will discuss complexity measures and initial field results.</br>
