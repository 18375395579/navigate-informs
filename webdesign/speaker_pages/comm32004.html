In this paper, we base on social capital theory to investigate what factors can influence an individual’s trust network in an online community. Specifically, we propose that an individual’s (1)reputation of helpfulness, (2)activeness in the community, and (3)popularity in the network can increase his/her social capital, which will further win him/her trusts from the other network members.</br>
