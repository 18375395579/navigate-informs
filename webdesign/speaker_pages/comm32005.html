Title: Multiattribute Utility as a Mixture of Exponential Utilities and Stochastic Dominance<br>Author: Ilia Tsetlin, Assistant Professor of Decision Sciences, INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Avenue, 138676, Singapore, ilia.tsetlin@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert L. Winkler<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Suppose that a decision maker prefers more of any attribute to less, and prefers combining good random variables with bad ones. We show that her utility is then a mixture of multiattribute exponential utilities. We consider dominance implications for multivariate distributions and relations to multiattribute utilities based on various independence assumptions. The results can be important for utility assessment and decision making.
