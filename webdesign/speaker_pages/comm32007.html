Title: How do Prediction Markets Predict?<br>Author: Abraham Othman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5560 Bartlett Street, Pittsburgh, PA, 15217, United States of America, aothman@cs.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Prediction markets are remarkable aggregators of information. But are they more accurate than, say, a subsidized average estimate from a handful of their most prescient contributors?  In this talk, I discuss the evidence for and against the so-called Marginal Trader Hypothesis, which attributes virtually all of a market's success to a small group of savvy participants. I discuss the implication of this hypothesis in the design of future markets, and computation's vital role in that future.
