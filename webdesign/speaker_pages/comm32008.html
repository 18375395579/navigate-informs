Title: An Empirical Test of Gain-Loss Separability in Prospect Theory<br>Author: Alex Markle, University of Chicago, 2958 N Clark St, Unit 3, Chicago, IL, 60657, United States, amarkle@chicagogsb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): George Wu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate a basic premise of prospect theory, that the valuation of gains and losses is separable. In prospect theory, gain-loss separability implies that a mixed gamble is valued by summing the valuations of the gain and loss portions of that gamble. We demonstrate a systematic violation of the double matching axiom, an axiom that is necessary for gain-loss separability.
