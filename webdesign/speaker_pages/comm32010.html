Title: Planning Production Capacity for Uncertain Scale-economies<br>Author: Aadhaar Chaturvedi, Assistant Professor, Univeristy of Namur, Rempart de la Vierge 8, Namur, 5000, Belgium, aadhaar.chaturvedi@fundp.ac.be<br>Coauthor(s): Nishant Mishra<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In quickly scaling-up production capacity for products such as photovoltaic cells, that are manufactured using novel production technologies leading to uncertain scale economies, the manufacturer runs the risk of being over-capacitated. In this paper we present a model that captures the trade-off between the risk of being over-capacitated in scaling-up quickly and the loss of market opportunity in scaling-up slowly, and analyze the optimal rate of capacity scale-up.
