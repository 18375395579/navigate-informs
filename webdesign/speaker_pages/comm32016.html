<br>Title: Particle Filter Based Real-time Freeway Traffic State Estimation with Lagrangian Measurements</br><br>Author: Kerem Demirtas, Research Assistant, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, kerem.demirtas@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhuoyang Zhou, Pitu Mirchandani</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: With the development of modern traffic flow sensing technologies, various vehicle-based Lagrangian measurements become available for enhancing traffic state estimation. This research designs a particle filter in the Lagrangian coordinate system for estimating the evolution of traffic state over time and space. Validation against other existing estimators shows improved accuracy.</br>
