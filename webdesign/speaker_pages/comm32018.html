Given this overabundance of information, the commander’s dilemma will be to find optimal decisions throughout mission duration. We will discuss our current work with Dynamic Decision Networks (DDNs). DDNs are very efficient decision making tools for complex problems and thus are a good alternative for military decision makers. We will present a short background of DDNs and the organization of our research. We will also highlight the value model that we have used in all of our models.</br>
