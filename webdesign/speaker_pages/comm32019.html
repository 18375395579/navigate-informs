Traditionally, military aircraft have provided this airlift. However, commercial carriers were providing a significant amount of this airlift circa 2009. But was this more cost-effective than using U.S. Air Force aircraft? To explore this question, we utilized econometric and optimization models to identify the most cost-effective combination of commercial and government airlift.</br>
