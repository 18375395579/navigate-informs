Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27711, United States of America, Kaplan.Ozge@epamail.epa.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tim Johnson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This study examines how interactions between the bioenergy supply chain and larger energy system affect regional feedstock demand and distribution-related energy needs.  The analysis combines a GIS assessment of regional variation in feedstock supply, transportation infrastructure, and biofuels demand with output from the U.S.EPA's MARKAL energy system model.</br>
