Title: Analysis of Biomass Competition for Bioenergy and Biofuels Using U.S. EPA MARKAL Model<br>Author: Ozge Kaplan, Research Fellow, U.S. EPA - Office of Research and Development, Mail Drop: E305-02, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27711, United States of America, Kaplan.Ozge@epamail.epa.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Johnson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This study examines how interactions between the bioenergy supply chain and larger energy system affect regional feedstock demand and distribution-related energy needs.  The analysis combines a GIS assessment of regional variation in feedstock supply, transportation infrastructure, and biofuels demand with output from the U.S.EPA's MARKAL energy system model.
