Title: Portfolio Optimization Under Liquidity Constraints on Specific Assets<br>Author: Amit Bhandari, Ph.D. Candidate, Northwestern University, amitb@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Birge<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Institutional portfolios have recently increased investments in alternative assets. We assume an agent with CRRA utility can invest in a hedge fund that has a high allocation under Merton (1969). We study the impact of liquidity constraints that arise due to the hedge fund's trading rules on its optimal allocation. We also extend the above analysis to construct a quantitative measure for the value of continuous access to hedge fund performance information.
