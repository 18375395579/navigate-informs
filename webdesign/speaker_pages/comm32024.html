We assume an agent with CRRA utility can invest in a hedge fund that has a high allocation under Merton (1969). We study the impact of liquidity constraints that arise due to the hedge fund's trading rules on its optimal allocation. We also extend the above analysis to construct a quantitative measure for the value of continuous access to hedge fund performance information.</br>
