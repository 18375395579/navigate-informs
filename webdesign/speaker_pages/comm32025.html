Title: Future Scenarios for the Spanish Electricity Sector: Is It on the Right Path Towards Sustainability<br>Author: Pedro Linares, Professor, Universidad Pontificia Comillas, Alberto Aguilera 23, Madrid, 28015, Spain, pedro.linares@upcomillas.es<br>Coauthor(s): Francisco Javie Santos, Ignacio Pérez-Arriaga<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Spanish electricity model is clearly unsustainable: the large increase in electricity demand, a huge dependency on energy imports, and significant environmental impacts are reasons for concern. In this paper we take a look at its possible evolution under different policy scenarios, and try to identify which may be the more sustainable policies. Results are optimistic in that carbon emissions and energy imports may be reduced at reasonable costs.
