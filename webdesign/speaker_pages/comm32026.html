<br>Title: Product Development as a Problem Solving Process</br><br>Author: Christian Terwiesch, Associate Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 548 JMHH, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, terwiesch@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We establish a problem solving framework that towards product development. Our problem solving view, which goes back to the work by Simon, is sufficiently general that it allows us to abstain from favoring any one of the many existing academic disciplines associated with product development. It also reveals many similarities between the existing literature streams, illustrates how these streams have cross-fertilized each other, and points to fruitful areas of future research.</br>
