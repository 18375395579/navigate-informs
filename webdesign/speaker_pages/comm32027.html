Title: Driving a Quality Transformation in IT Services<br>Author: Arjun Natarajan, IBM TJ Watson Research, United States of America, arjunn@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Quality of IT Services has become increasingly complex for both service providers and consumers. Large-scale outsourcing, global fulfillment and delivery, fragmented providers, lack of comprehensive metrics and a highly mobile workforce are some of the factors driving the complexity and challenges to providing predictable, high quality IT services. We will discuss a conceptual framework on how to intuitively think about services quality and operational actions to drive a quality transformation.
