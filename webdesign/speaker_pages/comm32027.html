Large-scale outsourcing, global fulfillment and delivery, fragmented providers, lack of comprehensive metrics and a highly mobile workforce are some of the factors driving the complexity and challenges to providing predictable, high quality IT services. We will discuss a conceptual framework on how to intuitively think about services quality and operational actions to drive a quality transformation.</br>
