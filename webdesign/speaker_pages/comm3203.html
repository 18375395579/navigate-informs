Title: Empirical Evidence on the Impact of Component Standardization on Product Quality<br>Author: Kamalini Ramdas, Associate Professor, Darden School, 189 FOB, 100 Darden Boulevard, Charlottesville, VA, 22902, United States, Ramdask@Darden.virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Taylor Randall<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We report on an empirical study that examines the impact of component standardization on product reliability, in the context of automotive braking systems. We find that depending on how it is done, standardization can either help or hurt reliability.  We also discuss how standardization can impact quality in other industries.
