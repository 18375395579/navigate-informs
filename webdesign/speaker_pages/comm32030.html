<br>Title: New Service Development and Value Creation in E-retailing</br><br>Author: Kingshuk Sinha, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States of America, ksinha@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gregory Heim, Anto (John) Verghese, Howard Hao-Chun Chuang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Technology-enabled new service development is investigated using multi-year panel data on e-retailers. A theory driven empirical analysis is conducted to assess how e-retailer's operating characteristics drive e-retailer survival or death, scaling up of operations, and business value. Survival-conditional effects of efficiency, lock-in, novelty, and complementarities on several performance metrics are examined.</br>
