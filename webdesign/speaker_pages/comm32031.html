We show that as software bugs stay in the system longer, the probability of successfully resolving them reduces. We use this insight to estimate engineering resources required to manage debugging effort. We explore cut off policy based on threshold time without finding a successful resolution. Our analysis shows that such policies minimally impact rate of successful resolution and reduce waiting times for incoming bugs.</br>
