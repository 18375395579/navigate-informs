Title: Operating Rooms Capacity Planning: Implementing the Newsvendor Model with Heterogeneous Demand<br>Author: Polly Biyu He, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, bhe@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stefanos Zenios, Alex Macario<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the presence of uncertain duration, operating room schedulers face the challenge of allocating time to the specialties in a hospital. While previous research has studied reserving time for individual cases, we consider allocating block time, which has great impact on staffing costs.  Using data from a hospital, we develop a regression-newsvendor model to predict block usage. Compared to lognormal and nonparametric models, the regression lowers the over- and under- staffing costs by over 30%.
