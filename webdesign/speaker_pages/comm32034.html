Title: How Can You Price a Phrase? Search Engine Auctions as Evolving Practices<br>Author: Charles W. Smith, charles.smith@qc.cuny.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Sponsored word/phrase Internet search engine auctions, like many emerging Internet markets, deal with what might be called virtual commodities that defy normal spatial-temporal parameters. These markets are also highly dependent upon modern computer and digital technologies. Perhaps most importantly, many of these markets are engaged in definitional transformations that involve not only changes in the ranking and values of parameters, but the introduction of new parameters. While a number of word/phrase auctions, each with its own peculiarities, are presently operative, the discussion that follows will deal exclusively with the two largest auctions: one sponsored by Overture  and the other by Google.
