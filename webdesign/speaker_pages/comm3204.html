Rowe Sr., Senior Consultant, Project Performance Corporation, 1760 Old Meadow Road, McLean, VA, 22102, United States, wrowe10@comcast.net<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Game theory addresses strategic approaches when facing rational opponents.

The missing piece is the motivation of the players, requiring a need to map them.
