<br>Title: Explore Equivalence of Accelerated Testing Plans Using a Principal Stress Decomposition Approach</br><br>Author: Haitao Liao, Assistant Professor, Wichita State University, 1845 Fairmount St., Industrial & Manufacturing Eng Dept, Wichita, KS, 67260-0035, United States, haitao.liao@wichita.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elsayed Elsayed, Zhaojun Li</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: One challenge in ALT is to determine an efficient stress profile. We explore the equivalence of various ALT plans involving complex stress profiles. A stress decomposition approach is investigated, which decomposes a complex stress profile into principal stress elements. From the results, equivalent optimal test plans can be determined and optimized. The research finding is validated through a resistor ALT experiment involving both electrical and thermal stresses.</br>
