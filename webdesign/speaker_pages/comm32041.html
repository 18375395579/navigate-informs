Title: Phase I Change Detection of Quality Profiles in Low-E Glass Manufacturing Processes<br>Author: Li Zeng, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Arlington, 500 West First Street, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, lzeng@uta.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The concerns on energy and environment during the past decades have led to the manufacturing of low-emittance (low-E) glass. The current practice of quality monitoring in low-E glass manufacturing processes does not make a full use of the available quality profile measurements in these processes. In this study, we developed Bayesian approaches for the Phase I monitoring of quality profiles in these processes.
