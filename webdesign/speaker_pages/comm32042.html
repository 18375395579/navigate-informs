Title: To Screen or Not To Screen: A Decision Analysis for Genetic Screening for Lynch Syndrome<br>Author: Tuan Dinh, VP Analytics and Modeling, Archimedes Inc, 123 Mission St, 11th Floor, San Francisco, CA, 94105, United States of America, tuan.dinh@archimedesmodel.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Lynch syndrome (LS) is a genetically inherited predisposition to multiple types of cancer. Current guidelines recommend that a diagnostic workup for LS begin when an individual already presents with cancer.  We developed a decision analysis to determine under which conditions offering genetic testing to individuals at high risk of carrying LS mutations prior to cancer development will lead to improved health outcomes in a cost effective way.
