The manager pursues knowledge development and transfer over time. Through knowledge transfer from a source to recipient stage, the manager enhances the recipient’s knowledge development capabilities. We examine how the effectiveness of knowledge development, prior knowledge, and feedback impact the manager’s strategies.</br>
