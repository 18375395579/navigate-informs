To that end, we report the status and perspectives of RFID in container transportation and handling. Moreover, since new processes are considered indispensable to match the revolutionary characteristics of RFID, we describe container handing processes re-engineering. Finally, we discuss Management Science opportunities that have emerged within this new area of research.
