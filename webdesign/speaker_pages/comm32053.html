<br>Title: Developing Computational Model Framework for Sustainability Planning of Eco-Industrial  Network</br><br>Author: Anthony Halog, Assistant Professor, University of Maine, 1263 Western Avenue, Orono, ME, 04469, United States of America, anthony.halog@maine.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Najet Bichraoui</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Attaining industrial sustainability requires collaborative efforts from participating agents toward common goals such as resource conservation, low carbon emissions, production efficiency, and economic viability. This study aims to operationalize the notion of system sustainability by developing a framework for computational modeling and design of an industrial ecology-modeled forest biorefinery.</br>
