<br>Title: Hospital Characteristics, Health Information Technology, and Stage One Meaningful Use</br><br>Author: Jingyun Li, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 W. Campbell Rd., Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, jxl097620@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kristin Jenkins, Indranil Bardhan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the characteristics of hospitals that are likely to achieve Stage 1 meaningful use (MU). We find that acute care, for-profit and non-profit hospitals are more likely to achieve Stage 1 MU. Hospitals with EMR and those that use health IT are also likely to achieve Stage 1 MU. Our results suggest strong associations between hospital ownership, health IT and Stage 1 MU compliance.</br>
