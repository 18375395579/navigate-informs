<br>Title: Adversarial Classification</br><br>Author: Bowei Xi, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, xbw@stat.purdue.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Many data mining applications are faced with active adversaries. In all  these applications, initially successful classifiers could degrade easily.  We investigate the possibility of an equilibrium in this  seemingly never ending game, where  neither party has an incentive to  change. We develop a game theoretic framework where the equilibrium  behavior of adversarial learning applications can be analyzed, and provide  a solution for estimating the equilibrium point.</br>
