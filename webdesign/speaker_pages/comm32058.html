Title: Measuring Humanitarian Response Capacity<br>Author: Jason Acimovic, Pennsylvania State University, 462 Business Building, State College, PA, 16802, United States of America, acimovic@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jarrod Goentzel<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Preparedness efforts for natural or man-made disasters often include prepositioning key relief items in strategic locations. Aid organizations must determine the overall investment for each product and the allocation of inventory among depots. We develop a model that measures the capacity to respond to a disaster and the quality of the inventory allocation. We test the model using historical data on disaster-affected populations and stock levels from United Nations depots.
