Title: Complex Infrastructure Systems: Their Characteristics and the Impact of Control<br>Author: David Newman, Professor, Univ. of Alaska Fairbanks, Physics Department, P.O. Box 755920, Fairbanks, AK, 99775, United States, ffden@uaf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ben Carreras, Ian Dobson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Critical infrastructures such as power transmission networks and communication systems display many of the characteristic properties of complex systems. They exhibit infrequent large cascading failures that often obey a power law distribution in their PDF as well as long time correlations. This behavior suggests that conventional risk analysis cannot be applied to these systems. These system dynamics and their counterintuitive response to attempts at control will be discussed.
