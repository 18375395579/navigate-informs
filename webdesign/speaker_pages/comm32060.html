Stern School of Business., 44 W 4TH ST #8-92, New York, NY, United States of America, atuzhili@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zan Huang, Gediminas Adomavicius</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this tutorial, we present an overview of the personalization field and review different types of personalization. We also discuss the general personalization process and position the field of recommender systems as an integral part of this process. We review the field of recommender systems by describing a number of “traditional?recommendation approaches and their extensions. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for personalization and recommender systems, including integrated personalization process, data acquisition for recommender systems, advanced modeling of user preferences, other model-based techniques for recommendation, evaluation of recommender systems, recommendation flexibility and scalability, and trust and privacy issues in recommender systems.</br>
