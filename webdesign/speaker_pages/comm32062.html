Over 60,00 member physicians aggregate observations from their daily practice and then - rapidly and in large numbers - challenge or corroborate each others opinions, accelerating the emergence of trends and new insights on medications, devices and treatments. They can then apply the collective knowledge to achieve better outcomes for their patients.</br>
