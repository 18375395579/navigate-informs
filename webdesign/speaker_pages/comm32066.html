Title: Project Screening Biases in a Product Development Pipeline<br>Author: Nitin Joglekar, Boston University, Boston, MA, United States of America, joglekar@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paulo Figueiredo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Product development pipelines, a special case of a service supply chain, suffer from the backlog bullwhip effect. We illustrate that screening can eliminate such backlog bullwhip. Statistical analysis of simulation results addresses a range of relevant decisions for a two-stage pipeline: the number of starts, screen thresholds, global biases towards frontloading the available resources and local biases while adjusting capacity utilization.
