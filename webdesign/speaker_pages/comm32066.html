We illustrate that screening can eliminate such backlog bullwhip. Statistical analysis of simulation results addresses a range of relevant decisions for a two-stage pipeline: the number of starts, screen thresholds, global biases towards frontloading the available resources and local biases while adjusting capacity utilization.</br>
