Title: Projects and Team Dynamics<br>Author: George Georgiadis, University of California-Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, georgiadis@ucla.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper studies the dynamic collaboration of a team on a project that stochastically evolves to completion over time. The main result is that members of a larger team work harder both individually and on aggregate if and only if the project is sufficiently far from completion. By using this framework, I examine how a manager who recruits agents into a team to complete a project on her behalf should choose the team composition, as well as the agents?compensations.
