Title: Managing Outsourced Product Design: The Effectiveness of Alternative Integration Mechanisms<br>Author: Geoffrey Parker, Tulane University, A. B. Freeman School of Business, 7 McAlister Dr., New Orleans, LA, 70118, United States of America, gparker@tulane.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alison Davis-Blake, Edward Anderson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We report preliminary results from a four-year study of interorganizational integration mechanisms and coordination tools used during product and process development projects. Results suggest that nearly all firms employ personnel dedicated to managing outsourcing relationships. Surprisingly, firms make little use of sophisticated information technology or modular product designs.  We find that the effects of a single mechanism or tool can vary dramatically across different outcomes.
