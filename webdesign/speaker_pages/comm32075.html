Title: Maximum Commonality Problems: Applications and Analysis<br>Author: Milind Dawande, Associate Professor, University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, Richardson, TX, 75083, United States, milind@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vijay Mookerjee, Subodha Kumar, Chelliah Sriskandarajah<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Motivated by applications in extreme programming, we discuss algorithmic results for the problem of assigning pairs of developers to modules so as to maximize a graph-theoretic notion of commonality -- a measure of the extent to which common developers work on related modules -- subject to a load-balancing constraint.
