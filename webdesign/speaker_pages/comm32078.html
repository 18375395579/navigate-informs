Medical decision makers must learn about treatment effectiveness using noisy, subjective feedback from patients. We develop a model for choosing between treatments with unknown stochastic effectiveness, where the belief about effectiveness evolves dynamically and treatments may have side effects that decrease quality of life. We illustrate our model for Multiple Sclerosis.</br>
