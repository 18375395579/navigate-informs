<br>Title: Demand Unconstraining in Price-based Revenue Management System</br><br>Author: Jian Wang, Vice President of Research and Development, RainMaker Group, 5755 North Point Parkway, Suite 77, Alpharetta, GA, 30022, United States, jwang@letitrain.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In traditional quantity-based revenue management system (RMS), unconstraining takes into account the constraints of capacity limitation and stay control. A list of methods has been published. In price-based RMS, on the other hand, demand is mainly censored in the presence of capacity limitation and market rates. No unconstraining publications can be found in the literature yet. In an attempt to draw attention to this area, we describe the definition of the unconstrained demand, and illustrate an unconstraining example in multi-family RMS.</br>
