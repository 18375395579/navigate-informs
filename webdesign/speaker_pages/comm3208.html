Title: Detecting Errors in Spreadsheets<br>Author: Kenneth Baker, Professor, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, 03755, United States, Kenneth.R.Baker@Dartmouth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Powell, Barry Lawson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Previous research on spreadsheet errors has suggested that 2-5 percent of cells contain errors. However, little has been published on what types of errors were discovered, how they were discovered, how they were created, and how users might avoid creating them. We have audited 50 spreadsheets from the field using a repeatable auditing protocol and two types of auditing software. We report on the types of errors we have found and how they were discovered during the auditing process.
