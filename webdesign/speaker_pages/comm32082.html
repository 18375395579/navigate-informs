<br>Title: An Empirical Investigation of Technology Adoption Sequences in Hospitals</br><br>Author: Carrie Queenan, Assistant Professor, University of Notre Dame, 379 Mendoza College of Business, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, United States of America, c_queenan@nd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Corey Angst, Sarv Devaraj, Brad Greenwood</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this hospital-level study, we examine implementation characteristics  of technology applications within a department and explore their relationship to performance.  Questions answered include: 1) what is the sequence in which technology applications are adopted, 2) do these sequences affect performance?  This essay contributes to academic literature by suggesting that the order of adoption must be considered in the measurement of technology value.</br>
