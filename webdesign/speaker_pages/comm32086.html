Title: Heterogeneity in Infectious Diseases: Human Behavior in a Pandemic as a Markov Decision Processes<br>Author: Karima Nigmatulina, MIT, knigmatu@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Larson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: High activity and high susceptibility people are drivers of infectious disease such as pandemic flu.  A new type of heterogeneity is how individuals alter their behavior in a pandemic scenario.  Some will choose to remain at home to decrease their chances of being infected, but others will not or cannot alter their daily routines, implying higher risk of getting sick.  We present a Markov Decision Model and show how behavior changes made by individuals can alter the outcome of the pandemic.
