Title: Fair Supply Chains: Implications and Complications of Fair Trade in Supply Chain Modeling<br>Author: M. Ali Ulku, Assistant Professor, School of Management and Leadership, Capital University, 1 College and Main, Columbus, OH, 43209, United States of America, aulku@capital.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Fair Supply Chains (FSCs) aim to achieve a greater equity in international trading, and thus, sustainable development. As consumers become more socially responsible, the demand and therefore the shelves for certified fair trade goods in big retailers have been expanding rapidly. In many aspects, FSCs greatly differ from Commercial Supply Chains (CSCs). This research introduces modeling challenges in FSCs and proposes a fairness-coordination mechanism that can be integrated to a global CSC.
