Title: A Clarity-focused DA Process: Integral Decision Analysis<br>Author: Roberto Ley-Borras, Director, Consultoria en Decisiones, Oriente 13 A No. 1122, Entre Norte 28 y 28 A, Orizaba, Ver., MX, CP94300, Mexico, rley@decidir.org<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Decision analysis teaching and practice have been mostly model-oriented, but process-oriented DA can be more complete and efficient.  This talk presents a DA process that develops logically from framing to objectives, alternatives, uncertain events, interactions, evaluation, choice and implementation design.  In addition to their logical connection, each step is intended as an opportunity to create value and get clarity about the nature of the decision situation.
