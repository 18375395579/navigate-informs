We propose a portfolio optimization framework that takes into account the uncertainty in fund allocation and consider both a robust optimization approach and a stochastic perspective. We then provide insights into the impact of the uncertainty related to the asset allocation and the asset returns on portfolio performance and the manager selection policy.
