Title: Determining Cost-effective Portfolios of Weapon Systems<br>Author: Juuso Liesi? Researcher, Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory, P.O. Box 1100, TKK, 02015, Finland, juuso.liesio@tkk.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Ahti Salo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Investments into weapon systems are expensive, yet they are hard to evaluate due to the presence of multiple impact criteria and interactions between weapon systems. We present a non-linear optimization model that helps identify cost-effective portfolios of weapon systems at different budget levels and also in view of different impact criteria. The model admits incomplete preference information about these criteria and accounts for interactions that exist between complementary weapon systems.
