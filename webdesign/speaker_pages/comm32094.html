Title: Topological Considerations for Air Transport Networks<br>Author: Rex Kincaid, Professor, College of William & Mary, Department of Mathematics, Williamsburg, VA, 23187-8795, United States of America, rrkinc@wm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Scott Billie, Erik Vargo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine the emergent historical route structures for the NAS network (1920 to the present).  Tools developed to analyze the impact of graph-theoretic attributes (e.g. degree distribution,  assortativity, and synchronization) on traditional measures of performance are presented.  We explore how these tools can support air transportation topology decisions.
