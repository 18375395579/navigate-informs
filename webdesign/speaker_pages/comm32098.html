Title: Towards Assessing the Homogeneity of Service Architectures at the Market Level<br>Author: Tilo Böhmann, Universität Hamburg, Germany, Vogt-Kölln-Straße 30, Hamburg, 22527, Germany, Tilo.Boehmann@uni-hamburg.de<br>Coauthor(s): Regine Dörbecker, Torsten Harms<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Recent research on service modularity emphasizes the concept of service architecture. This research lacks guidance for the operationalization of this concept and predominately uses firm-level, qualitative data. We propose an approach to assess quantitatively service architectures at the market level. We particularly study architecture homogeneity across service providers to understand to what extent market forces shape architectural decisions using quantitative data on German insurance services.
