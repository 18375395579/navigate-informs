The gold standard for delivering HD is via Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF). Due to AVF creation failure, limited lifetime of a functional AVF, and limited places to create an AVF, patients may use an inferior access substitute called Central Venous Catheter (CVC). We characterize conditions under which the patient should or should not be referred for AVF creation, under total lifetime and quality adjusted lifetime metrics.</br>
