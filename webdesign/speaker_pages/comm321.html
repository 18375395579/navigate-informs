<br>Title: Risk-aware SLA Design for Enterprise Information Systems</br><br>Author: Dirk Neumann, Professor, Albert-Ludwigs Universität Freiburg, Platz der Alten Synagoge 1, Freiburg, 79085, Germany, dirk.neumann@is.uni-freiburg.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Markus Hedwig, Simon Malkowski</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Since effective IT systems are necessary for business practices, growing operation costs necessitate the search for efficient delivery models. Cloud Computing provides a powerful alternative to traditional IT operation. Firms still have reservations about migrating to the Cloud due to the lack of binding SLA offerings. Service providers hesitate to offer binding SLAs as assessing economic risks is challenging. We present a model for SLA design for clouds to estimate the induced operational risk.</br>
