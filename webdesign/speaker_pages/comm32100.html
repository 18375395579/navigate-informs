Title: A Comparison of Safety and Security Factors on Alternative Rail Routes<br>Author: Theodore S. Glickman, Professor, The George Washington University, Decision Sciences Department, 415 Funger Hall, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, glickman@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Galen Evans, Ryan Engstrom, Nuala Cowan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The issue of how to route trains carrying highly hazardous materials is examined for a selected case study. Using public information on factors related to safety and security (where the concerns are release accidents and terrorist attacks, respectively), as well as profitability (where the concern is operating costs and revenues), a GIS is applied to a selected shipment scenario in order to evaluate and compare the factors. The implications of the results for risk management are discussed.
