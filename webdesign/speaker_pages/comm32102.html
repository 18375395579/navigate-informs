All of these are for good reasons.  However, some recent findings and episodes have led some to question the validity of those techniques.  The purpose of the panel discussion is to shed some light on this issue. Particular topics that deserve critical evaluation include difficulties with demand modeling, consumers' perception (real or imagined) of dynamic pricing practices as unfair, and new practices from airline companies such as simplification of the fare structure.
