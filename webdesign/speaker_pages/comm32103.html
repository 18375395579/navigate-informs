These cross-market trades in the arbitrage network benefit the arbitrageurs and the investors in financial markets. However, the profit distributions of the arbitrageurs and the investors are different between two arbitrageurs?trading modes, i.e. sequential and simultaneous. Some examples are given to illustrate the difference.
