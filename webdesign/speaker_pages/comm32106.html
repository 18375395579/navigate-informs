Title: Efficient Feed-in-Tariff Policies for Renewable Energy Technologies<br>Author: Saed Alizamir, PhD student, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, United States of America, saed.alizamir@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francis de Véricourt, Peng Sun<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper provides insights and guidance into designing effective and cost-efficient Feed-In-Tariff policies to promote deployment of renewable energies. We propose a dynamic optimization modeling framework with learning and diffusion effects, and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We compare this structure against the current practice of FIT-implementing jurisdictions, and show how it depends on technology and market characteristics.
