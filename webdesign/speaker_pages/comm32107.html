Title: Decision Markets and Moral Hazard<br>Author: Shimon Kogan, Assistant Professor of Finance, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, kogan@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anthony Kwasnica, Roberto Weber<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the use of markets as a forecasting tool for internal firm decision making. In this setting, it is likely that the participants in the market will also have the ability to affect the outcome of the market through some private, unobservable actions. We conduct laboratory experiments where subjects participate in both a coordination game and a market designed to predict the outcome of the coordination game.
