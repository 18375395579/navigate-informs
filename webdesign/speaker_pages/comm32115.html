Title: Structural Changes in North American Fertilizer Logistics<br>Author: Sumadhur Shakya, Graduate Student/Spatial Transportation Analyst, North Dakota State University, Upper Great Plains Transportation Inst., Fargo, ND, 58102, United States of America, sumadhur.shakya@ndsu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Traditionally U.S. imports Nitrogen Fertilizers.Lower cost of natural gas from fracking has increased the incentive for producing N-fertilizers domestically. Changing geographic production of corn has shifted consumption patterns. Proposed plants can tap cheaper natural gas from fracking or use by-products from ethanol to produce N-fertilizer.This translates to changes in demand and supply of Nitrogen fertilizers in the U.S.,structurally and geographically,with potential to allow future exports.
