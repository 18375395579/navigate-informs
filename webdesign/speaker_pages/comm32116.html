Avrahami</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Using in-cycle sales information, we develop an innovative pooling model of Delayed Distribution, and practical optimization algorithms. Enabled by EDI/RFID systems, the models and algorithms were implemented in Yedioth, the largest media group in Israel, to support distribution decisions of its print magazines. Dramatic reduction in production and return levels with same levels of sales were documented. The new distribution model is piloted in other industries, and opens new research questions.</br>
