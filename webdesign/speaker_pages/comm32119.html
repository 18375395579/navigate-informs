In this research, we provide an analytical assessment of the potential of the widely-adopted collective EPR implementations to provide design incentives to producers via cost allocation design. Our study demonstrates the impact of operational-level factors (e.g., synergy from resource sharing) on the design implication of EPR implementation.</br>
