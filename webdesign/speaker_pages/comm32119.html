Title: Product Design or Cost Efficiency? ?A Network Perspective on Extended Producer Responsibility<br>Author: Luyi Gui, The Paul Merage School of Business, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697, United States of America, luyi.gui@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Atalay Atasu, Beril Toktay, Ozlem Ergun<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool that stipulates the financial responsibility of producers for post-use handling of their products. In this research, we provide an analytical assessment of the potential of the widely-adopted collective EPR implementations to provide design incentives to producers via cost allocation design. Our study demonstrates the impact of operational-level factors (e.g., synergy from resource sharing) on the design implication of EPR implementation.
