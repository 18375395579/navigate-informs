Title: Successful and Unsuccessful Episodes of MultiCommunicating<br>Author: Jeanine Turner, Associate Professor of Communication, Culture, & Technology, Georgetown University, 311 Car Barn, Washington, DC, 20057, United States of America, turnerjw@georgetown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lamar Reinsch<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Critical incident descriptions indicate that flexibility of pace and compartmentalization facilitate multicommunicating. Our analysis also shows that multicommunicating is less successful when persons try to engage in too many interactions or address highly emotional topics. We argue that, while increasingly common, multicommunicating promotes a self-focused orientation, an emphasis on constant availability, and a model of the communication process as juggling rather than engaging in dialogue.
