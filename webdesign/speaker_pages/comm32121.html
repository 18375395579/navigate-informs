Our analysis also shows that multicommunicating is less successful when persons try to engage in too many interactions or address highly emotional topics. We argue that, while increasingly common, multicommunicating promotes a self-focused orientation, an emphasis on constant availability, and a model of the communication process as juggling rather than engaging in dialogue.</br>
