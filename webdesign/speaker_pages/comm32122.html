<br>Title: Modeling to Improve Incident Response</br><br>Author: William Wallace, Professor, Department of Decision Sciences and Engineering Systems, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, CII 5117  110 Eighth St, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, wallaw@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Salasznyk, Jing Gong, Earl Rusty Lee</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Incident response must be faster, more integrated, and more intelligent in responding to events in order to reduce the human, economic and environmental losses.  Ongoing research to improve incident response time is being conducted in the Capital District Region of NY, USA.  The focus of the work is on improving data sharing among first responders by using data mining and simulation to determine data needs and timing requirements.</br>
