Title: Potential Impacts of Bidding Mechanism on the Integration of Renewables with Existing Power Grid<br>Author: Zhaomiao Guo, UC Davis, Dept. of CEE, Davis, United States of America, watersguo@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Yueyue Fan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present a mathematical model that captures the behaviors of and the interdependence between players along the different echelons of an electricity supply chain when integrated with renewable sources.  Based on this model, we further examine how different bidding mechanism might affect the efficiency of the system, and how to identify an efficient mechanism that has the best potential for encouraging the integration of renewables to the existing power infrastructure.
