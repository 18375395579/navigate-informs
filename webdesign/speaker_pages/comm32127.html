<br>Title: Evaluation of Emergency Distribution Centers in Istanbul</br><br>Author: Ozay Ozaydin, Research Assistant, Dogus University, Zeamet S. No:21, Acibadem, Istanbul, 34722, Turkey, oozaydin@dogus.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ilker Topcu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In disaster management, logistics play a major role and distribution centers are namely in the center of this role. As Istanbul has a highly dynamic environment, the previous studies on location of distribution centers can rapidly become obsolete and even infeasable. Using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as main data input for an AHP model, this study not only evaluates the current situation but also proposes a dynamic system to make additional research and update process more manageable.</br>
