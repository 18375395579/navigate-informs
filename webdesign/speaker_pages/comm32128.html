We study the impact of flexibility in risk ratios by group, shared block or open posting time across multiple groups, as well as how an organization may characterize a high quality block schedule. Results indicate that inefficiencies introduced by standard block schedules result in additional ORs being open as well as unused staff labor hours. Data was provided by a major local hospital.</br>
