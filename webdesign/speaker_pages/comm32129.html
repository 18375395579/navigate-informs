Title: Deterring the Determined: Quantitative Models for the Deterrence of Terrorists<br>Author: Susan Martonosi, Assistant Professor, Harvey Mudd College, 301 Platt Boulevard, Claremont, CA, 91711, United States, martonosi@math.hmc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Walton<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Many homeland security models focus on system reliability in the event of an attack and neglect deterrence: terrorists might choose not to attack, or might shift their focus to less desirable targets, if the costs of attack become too high relative to the benefits. We present a model for resource allocation in which a defender must invest in protecting a target knowing that the attacker will either respond with heightened effort or give up. We characterize the optimal defender and attacker strategies and find that it is never optimal to leave the target undefended.
