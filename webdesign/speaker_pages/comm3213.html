Title: Cultivating Disaster Donors: A Case Application of Scalable Analytics on Massive Data<br>Author: Ilya Ryzhov, Assistant Professor, University of Maryland, 4322 Van Munching Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, iryzhov@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bin Han, Jelena Bradic<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present an empirical study of the effectiveness of donor cultivation and retention efforts for the American Red Cross, based on 8.6 million communications with past and recurring donors during 2009-2011. We find evidence that regular supporters of the program place surprisingly high value on disaster preparedness. Dynamically generated funding requests, used in 44% of Red Cross appeals, are effective in engaging recent donors, but have an adverse effect on donors whose involvement has lapsed.
