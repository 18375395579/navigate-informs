<br>Title: An Interactive Panel/Audience Discussion: Operations Research in Engineering - Expectations for Junior Faculty</br><br>Author: Warren Powell, Professor, Princeton University, Engineering Quadrangle, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, powell@princeton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Barnhart, Mark Daskin, John Birge, Thomas Magnanti</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this interactive panel discussion, we will discuss the expectations that junior faculty in engineering schools face, and contrast these with the expectations of faculty in other engineering departments, as well as operations research faculty in business schools. The goal of the panel is to bring out differences in expectations and to compare traditional measures used in engineering to evaluate tenure cases to those used by other disciplines.</br>
