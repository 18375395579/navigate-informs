<br>Title: A Framework for Assessing the Impact to Safety of Deploying New Aircraft Concepts into NextGen</br><br>Author: Alfredo Colon, CSSI Inc., 400 Virginia Avenue, SW, Suite 710, Washington, DC, 20024, United States of America, acolon@cssiinc.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a framework being developed to facilitate assessing the safety and associated tradeoffs of introducing new aircraft concepts into the Next Generation Air Transportation System. It aims to understand: the safety constraints imposed by NextGen on vehicle operations; the impact of new vehicle operations on safety; and the tradeoffs involved between the new vehicles and the ATM system for improving safety while maintaining operational flexibility and efficiency.</br>
