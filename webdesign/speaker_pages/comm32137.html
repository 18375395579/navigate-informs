Title: Market Premium for Self-marketing of Renewable Electricity in Germany: A Stochastic Analysis<br>Author: Reinhard Madlener, Professor of Energy Economics and Management, RWTH Aachen University, Mathieustrasse, Aachen, 52074, Germany, RMadlener@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de<br>Coauthor(s): Joscha Schabram<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The revised German Renewable Energies Act (EEG) 2012 introduced market premiums as a new instrument to provide an incentive for the self-marketing of renewable electricity. In our study, we investigate the optimal amount of capacity plant operators should market themselves for the provision of reserve energy. To this end, we apply mean-variance portfolio theory with the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure of choice.
