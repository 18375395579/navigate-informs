Title: Nonprofit Supply Chain Design: The Solar Cooking Case<br>Author: Gemma Berenguer, Purdue University, Krannert School of Management, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, gemmabf@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Z. Max Shen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The research community is paying increasing attention to the analysis of nonprofit practices that can differ from for-profit ones. In this talk we discuss the particularities of the private nonprofit organization (NPO) and, by extension, its supply chain. We illustrate this analysis with a case study of an NPO that introduces solar cooking to low-income countries with the objectives of improving social, economic, and environmental conditions. We focus on this NPO's supply chain design problems.
