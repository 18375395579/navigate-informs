<br>Title: Nonprofit Supply Chain Design: The Solar Cooking Case</br><br>Author: Gemma Berenguer, Purdue University, Krannert School of Management, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, gemmabf@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Z. Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The research community is paying increasing attention to the analysis of nonprofit practices that can differ from for-profit ones. In this talk we discuss the particularities of the private nonprofit organization (NPO) and, by extension, its supply chain. We illustrate this analysis with a case study of an NPO that introduces solar cooking to low-income countries with the objectives of improving social, economic, and environmental conditions. We focus on this NPO's supply chain design problems.</br>
