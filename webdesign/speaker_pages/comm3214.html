Title: Passenger Flow Simulation Model in A Complex Networked Transportation System<br>Author: Danyi Wang, Metron Aviation Inc., 45300 Catalina Ct., Dulles, VA, 20166, United States of America, wang@metronaviation.com<br>Coauthor(s): George Donohue, Bert Hackney, Lance Sherry<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper describes a passenger flow simulation which captures the asymmetric and unique passenger trip on-time performance and reflects the complexity and significance of the impact of a small set of cancelled flights and missed connections on passenger trip delays. It measures system performance from the flying public’s view. Furthermore, it enables researchers to conduct experiments outside the range of historical data.
