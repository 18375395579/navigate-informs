<br>Title: Platform Feature Investment in the Presence of Network Externalities</br><br>Author: Burcu Tan, PhD Student, University of Texas, 1 University Station, B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, burcu.tan@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Anderson, Geoffrey Parker</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine the development of product platforms in markets that exhibit network externalities. We focus on the trade-off firms must make between investing new product development resources to increase a platform’s core functionality versus investments designed to change or leverage the platform’s network externalities. Abstracting from examples drawn from multiple industries, we use a strategic model to gain intuition about how to make such trade-off decisions.</br>
