Title: Platform Feature Investment in the Presence of Network Externalities<br>Author: Burcu Tan, PhD Student, University of Texas, 1 University Station, B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, burcu.tan@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edward Anderson, Geoffrey Parker<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine the development of product platforms in markets that exhibit network externalities. We focus on the trade-off firms must make between investing new product development resources to increase a platform’s core functionality versus investments designed to change or leverage the platform’s network externalities. Abstracting from examples drawn from multiple industries, we use a strategic model to gain intuition about how to make such trade-off decisions.
