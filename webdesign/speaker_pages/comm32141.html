<br>Title: Computational Needs for Bulk Power System Operation and Planning</br><br>Author: Tongxin Zheng, Technical Manager, ISO New England, 1 Sullivan Road, Holyoke, MA, 01106, United States of America, tzheng@iso-ne.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eugene Litvinov</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Reliability and Economics are two major aspects of power system operation and planning. With the introduction of market mechanism, they are being tightly integrated in many processes in operations and planning, creating challenging mathematical problems in both operations research and micro economics.  The paper identifies the critical problems in these areas, and summarizes existing solution methodologies as well as future computational needs under the ISO managed market environment.</br>
