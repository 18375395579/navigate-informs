Title: Value in Development Organizations: A Complex Systems View<br>Author: Clay Williams, IBM Watson Research, 19 Skyline Drive, Hawthorne, NY, 10532, United States, clayw@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Klinger, Peri Tarr<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss a framework for exploring the alignment between business and technology goals and for mapping these goals to projects using development governance patterns.  These patterns are then applied to the organization performing the development projects.  We describe how concepts from complex systems theory can be used to understand the behavior of these organizations and to help develop a valuation model for the projects underway within the organization.
