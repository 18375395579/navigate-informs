Title: Competitive Disruption Mitigation in a Supply Chain<br>Author: Sang-Hyun Kim, Assistant Professor, Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT, 06511, United States of America, sang.kim@yale.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Firms managing equipment prone to breakdowns institute plans to perform preventive and reactive actions to avoid or reduce costly downtimes. We consider a supply chain that consists of multiple subsystem providers whose decisions together determine system-level performance. We focus specifically on incentive implications of interdependent performance outcomes and the strategies to mitigate the inefficiencies that arise from it.
