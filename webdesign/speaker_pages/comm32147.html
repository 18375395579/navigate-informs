Title: Patient Admission and Scheduling under Multiple Resource Constraints<br>Author: Christiane Barz, Assistant Professor, UCLA Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, United States of America, christiane.barz@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kumar Rajaram<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a patient admission problem to a hospital with multiple potential bottlenecks (e.g. beds and OR). While there is an uncontrolled arrival process of emergency patients, the hospital has the freedom to postpone or even reject the admission of non-emergency patients. We model the control process as a Markov Decision Process and suggest price-directed heuristics.
