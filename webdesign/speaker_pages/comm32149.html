<br>Title: Teaching the Simplex Algorithm in Matrix Form Using Spreadsheets</br><br>Author: Steven Harrod, Assistant Professor, University of Dayton, School of Business Administration, 300 College Park, Dayton, OH, 45469, United States of America, a2soft@aol.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Recent spreadsheet products offer matrix functions that allow the formulation of complex matrix equations in an appealing visual manner within spreadsheets. A spreadsheet can be written to demonstrate the matrix equations of the Simplex algorithm, and offer a more technical manual alternative to the traditional handwritten tableau. A spreadsheet demonstration of the matrix equations of the Simplex algorithm is given, as well as tips for student exercises on concepts such as corner points.</br>
