Title: Modeling Hospital Surge under the CDC's Cities Readiness Initiative<br>Author: Nathaniel Hupert, Cornell University, Weill Medical College, 411 E69th Street, New York, NY, 10021, United States of America, nah2005@med.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Xiong<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We developed a framework for modeling hospital surge arrivals after a large-scale anthrax exposure to quantify the impact of best practice  recommendations for community-based mass prophylaxis.  Output of this model can shed light on the gap between currently available resources and estimated demand over the course of health sector response to such events.
