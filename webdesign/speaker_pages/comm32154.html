<br>Title: Large-Scale Dynamic Stochastic Programming</br><br>Author: John R. Birge, Jerry W. and Carol Lee Levin Professor, University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business, 5807 S. Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States, john.birge@chicagogsb.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: While practical decision making requires the integration of many complex inputs, uncertain responses, and dynamic revisions, most OR/MS results pertain only to systems with simple relationships, certain or predictable responses, and limited opportunities for revision.  Optimization of fully dynamic and stochastic systems remains an ongoing challenge.  We address reasons for this persistent gap in practical optimization, potential developments to aid in its closure, and future needs.</br>
