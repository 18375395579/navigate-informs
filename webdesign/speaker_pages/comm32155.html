<br>Title: Impact of Collaborative Work on Student Learning in a Virtual Computer Laboratory</br><br>Author: Michael R. Bartolacci, Pennsylvania State University, 217 Gaige Building, IST, Room G217, Reading, PA, 19610, United States of America, mrb24@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abdullah Konak</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the impact of collaborative work on student learning using controlled experiments in an innovative virtual computer laboratory for teaching telecommunications and information security technologies.  In this paper, we are investigating how to best utilize the virtual computers for teaching information security debating such issues as whether learning is greater when exercises are conducted in groups or as individuals.</br>
