<br>Title: Workforce Cross Training and the Learning Effect</br><br>Author: David Nembhard, Faculty Advisor, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, dan12@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In the modern service and manufacturing work environments, where workers are   often asked to become skilled at many things, there is a need to calibrate the amount of cross training. One possible view is to balance the benefits of multi-functionality against the training costs required to achieve it. Several models are discussed in the context of simulation results in various scenarios.</br>
