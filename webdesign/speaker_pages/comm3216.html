Title: Optimal Sampling of Infrastructure Condition<br>Author: Rabi Mishalani, Ohio State University, mishalani@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Liying Gong<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This study focuses on quantifying the spatial sampling uncertainty associated with inspecting infrastructure condition, and developing a methodology that includes sample size as a decision variable in inspection and maintenance decision-making where total life-cycle cost is minimized. A numerical analysis demonstrating the value of both aspects is also presented.
