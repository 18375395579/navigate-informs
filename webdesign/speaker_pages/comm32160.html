Title: Learning to Operate: Management of Knowledge Creation and Transfer in Orthopedic Surgeries<br>Author: Nile Hatch, Marriott School - BYU, 619 TNRB, Provo, UT, 84602, United States of America, nile@byu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Moore<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The economics of hospital health care reward efficiency and quality.  Using a sample of almost 15,000 orthopedic surgeries, we  study the learning processes of surgeons, surgical teams, and hospitals.  While experience matters, so does management of learning.  We find that some hospital management practices promote learning and efficiency while others impede learning.
