Title: Newsvendor Decisions When Stakes Matter<br>Author: Mirko Kremer, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, United States of America, muk22@smeal.psu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Research on decision-making in the newsvendor problem has documented systematic order biases and a persistent inability to learn. We argue that these behavioral anomalies persist simply because making many small stakes decisions (the common implementation) allows simple decision heuristics to overpower the motive to make an optimal decision. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we find that subjects in fact learn how to place optimal newsvendor orders when stakes matter.
