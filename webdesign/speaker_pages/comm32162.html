The initiative is a method of combining payment for all service providers involved in an episode of care to a single payment. This initiative encourages care coordination and removes financial incentives of providers to increase volume without improving quality of care under the fee-for-service payments. We analyze the efficacy of this initiative in achieving the CMS?goal to maximize the welfare of medicare enrollees.
