Title: Deciding on the RFID Tagging Level of Inventories<br>Author: Evsen Korkmaz, Istanbul TechnicalL University, Macka 34367, Istanbul, Turkey, evsenkorkmaz@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Tarkan Tan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In a recent survey of retail chief information officers, it is reported that 55% of respondents plan to implement RFID capabilities in a near future. However, this investment is still very expensive to justify tagging on item-level for all SKUs. Therefore, it is important to decide on the level of RFID tagging for each SKU in the inventory: item, case, pallet, or none. In this talk, we present a model that can be used in making this decision, along with some results and managerial insights.
