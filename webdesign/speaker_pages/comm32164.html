<br>Title: Deciding on the RFID Tagging Level of Inventories</br><br>Author: Evsen Korkmaz, Istanbul TechnicalL University, Macka 34367, Istanbul, Turkey, evsenkorkmaz@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tarkan Tan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In a recent survey of retail chief information officers, it is reported that 55% of respondents plan to implement RFID capabilities in a near future.

In this talk, we present a model that can be used in making this decision, along with some results and managerial insights.</br>
