Title: Risk Trading in Multi-stage Stochastic Equilibrium<br>Author: Andy Philpott, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand, a.philpott@auckland.ac.nz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study multi-stage stochastic equilibrium models of risk trading in electricity markets with hydroelectric reservoir storage. Under an assumption of perfectly competitive and complete risk markets, we show how risk preferences expressed by dynamic coherent risk measures can be integrated into a risk averse social planning problem. We also discuss incomplete markets and present examples that demonstrate the welfare enhancing effects of risk-trading instruments of various types.
