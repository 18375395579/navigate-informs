Title: Applying Expert Elicitations to Inform Climate Policy: Carbon Capture and Storage<br>Author: Erin Baker, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 220 ELab, Amherst, MA, United States of America, edbaker@ecs.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Keisler<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We combine economics and decision analysis to incorporate the uncertainty of technical change into climate change policy analysis. We present the results of an expert elicitation on the prospects for technical change in carbon capture and storage. We conclude that we need to gather more information about the technical and societal potential for Carbon Capture.
