Title: Modeling Predator UAV Operations<br>Author: Alan Johnson, Associate Prof of Logistics, Air Force Institute of Technology, AFIT/ENS, 2950 Hobson Way, Bldg 641, W-P AFB, OH, 45433-7765, United States, alan.johnson@afit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Kretser<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Operation Iraqi Freedom accelerated the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's transition from development to operations, which precluded normal testing and capabilities refinement before use.  As such, the interrelationships of Predator vehicle, logistics support, and ground control system componentry are not well understood.  We present our progress and plans for simulating Predator flight operations and ground regeneration activities.
