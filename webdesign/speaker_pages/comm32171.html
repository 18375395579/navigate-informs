Title: Patient Flow in an ICU<br>Author: Edieal Pinker, Simon School, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14627, United States of America, ed.pinker@simon.rochester.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gregory Dobson, Hsiao-Hui Lee<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Many ICUs face overcrowding.One response is to bump ICU patients to other departments to make room for new patient arrivals. Bumping clearly has the potential to reduce care quality. We develop a stochastic model of a single ICU with patient bumping to enable planners to predict performance, under differing capacity and arrival patterns. We develop a aggregation-disaggregation algorithm that enables us to track the system time for each patient despite the high dimensionality of the problem.
