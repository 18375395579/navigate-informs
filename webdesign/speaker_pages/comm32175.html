Title: Buying from the Babbling Newsvendor: Availability Information and Cheap Talk<br>Author: Gad Allon, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, g-allon@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Achal Bassamboo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Provision of real-time information by a firm to its customers has become prevalent in recent years in both the service and retail sectors. In this paper, we study a retail operations model where customers are strategic in both their actions and in the way they interpret information, while the retailer is strategic in the way it provides information. This paper focuses on the ability (or the lack thereof) to communicate credibly unverifiable information.
