Title: Technological Coevolution: Critical Dynamics in Industry Transformation<br>Author: Jeroen Struben, MIT, E53-364A, 50 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, 02142, United States of America, jjrs@mit.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper addresses a neglected question within the phenomenon of technological discontinuities: how do promising technologies succeed or fail? I examine the role of technology coevolution through a dynamic simulation model with firm capabilities, resource allocation, and market factors. Counterintuitive results include technologies?breakthrough being enabled by competition. Findings highlight the importance of consideration of environmental interactions for understanding technological change.
