I examine the role of technology coevolution through a dynamic simulation model with firm capabilities, resource allocation, and market factors. Counterintuitive results include technologies?breakthrough being enabled by competition. Findings highlight the importance of consideration of environmental interactions for understanding technological change.</br>
