Abdul Aziz, Ph.D. Candidate, Purdue University, 150 Arnold Dr. Apt. 15, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, haziz@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research explores the mechanism of travel related short-term choices that involve trade-off between emissions and travel time. We investigate the heterogeneity in trade-off values at different traffic states and different choice contexts (route vs. departure time), and the heterogeneity across the individuals due to variation in taste and pro-environmental attitudes.</br>
