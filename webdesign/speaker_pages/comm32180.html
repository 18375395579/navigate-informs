Travis Waller<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The environmental justice (EJ) order passed a decade ago has far-reaching impacts for the transportation industry by requiring all projects that receive federal funding to show no disproportionately adverse impact to all protected populations. This presentation focuses on incorporating EJ analysis into transportation project selection. A heuristic method is presented to select network improvement projects that maximize accessibility for each protected population.
