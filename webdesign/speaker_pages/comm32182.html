Mathews, 117 Transportation Building, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, vijitashwa@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Deborah Thurston<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Efficient environmentally conscious product design requires rigorous understanding of customer preferences with strict conformance to government regulations. We present a methodology for modeling preferences of a widely distributed customer base under uncertainty, in a reuse environment, to ensure that the government, manufacturer and the customers speak the same language.
