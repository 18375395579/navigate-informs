Title: Dynamic Prioritization for Emergency Physicians<br>Author: Yann Ferrand, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, United States of America, yferran@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Todd Glass, Michael Magazine, Uday Rao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: To improve patient flow in an emergency department, we augment current prioritization practices with a consideration of actual time spent in the system. We use discrete event simulation to measure the performance of these new prioritization rules on both the average and on various percentiles of patient wait time, and compare them to the current practice at a specific emergency department.
