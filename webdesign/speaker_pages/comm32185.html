We show  that long chains can significantly increase eefficiency when opportunities for exchange are sparse. As large cycles of exchange cannot be used in practice, long chains initiated by  non-directed donors significantly increase eefficiency in pools of the size and composition  in practice. Importantly, long chains benefit highly sensitized patients without harming low-sensitized patients.</br>
