Title: Simulation-enabled Analytics at CSX<br>Author: Jeremiah Dirnberger, Manager-Operations Planning, CSX, 500 Water St, J315, Jacksonville, FL, 32202, United States of America, Jeremiah_Dirnberger@csx.com<br>Coauthor(s): Yu Wang, Ivan Atanassov, Krishna Jha<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The development of advanced simulation tools for terminal modeling at CSX and other railroads has created the opportunity to leverage the large amounts of data provided by these tools to describe, predict and improve terminal performance.  This presentation will discuss some of the foundational relationships of terminal performance as a function of train arrival performance, train length and spacing.  It will also review the relationship between the number of blocks and terminal capacity.
