<br>Title: No Room at the Emergency Room: Causes and Consequences</br><br>Author: Linda Green, Armand G. Erpf Professor, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, 423 Uris Hall, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, lvg1@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sherry Glied, M. Grams, Natalia Yankovic</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: ER overcrowding is worsening nationwide. Though sometimes dismissed as a minor problem due to more people who use the ER for routine medical problems, this masks potentially fatal consequences for seriously ill patients who do not receive timely care. We describe an NYC-based study which establishes a strong link between ambulance diversions and deaths from heart attacks. We also describe the underlying causes of ED overcrowding and how it is being exacerbated by governmental and payer policies.</br>
