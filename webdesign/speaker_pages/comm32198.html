Title: The Hidden Structure of Mental Maps<br>Author: Charles Weber, Assistant Professor of Eng. & Tech. Mgmnt., Portland State University, PO Box 751, Portland, OR, 97207, United States of America, webercm@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Brent Zenobia<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Most prior work on mental maps has focused on techniques for their elicitation and representation; what can be gleaned from investigating their structure? This study applies the Motive-Technology-Belief (MTB) framework to analyze structural relationships in mental maps to gain insight into the underlying processes of learning and technology adoption. A previously unsuspected feedback loop operates between bounded rationality and intuition; implications for technology management are discussed.
