The use of relative scales in Saaty’s AHP is especially useful in this regard, because it provides a way to quantify things which cannot be easily measured. The fundamental concept in ethical decision making is Stakeholder Analysis. We will argue in this paper that the AHP can serve a vital role in gaining the understanding of stakeholder interests required to find the sought after joint interests.</br>
