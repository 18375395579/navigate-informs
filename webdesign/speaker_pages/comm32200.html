Title: Mean-deviation Analysis in the Theory of Choice<br>Author: Anton Molyboha, Ph.D Student, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States, amolyboh@stevens.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bogdan Grechuk, Michael Zabarankin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Mean-deviation analysis, along with the existing theories of coherent   risk measures and dual utility, has been examined in the context of the   theory of choice, which studies individual preferences in terms of   ordering relationships. Axiomatic foundation of the theory of coherent   risk measures has been obtained as a relaxation of the axioms of the   dual utility theory, and a further relaxation of the axioms has been   shown to lead to the mean-deviation analysis.
