Title: Adaptive Modeling and Prediction in Time-variant Processes<br>Author: Eunshin Byon, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 2773 IOE Building, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States of America, ebyon@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nattavut Yampikulsak<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a new adaptive learning method for a dynamic system where the dependency among variables changes over time.  For a nonstationary process with time-varying input-to-output relationship, a single baseline curve may not accurately characterize the system's behavior. We develop a kernel-based, nonparametric regression model that allows the baseline curve to evolve over time, and provides the solution procedure.
