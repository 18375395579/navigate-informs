<br>Title: Optimal Product-Fusion and Offering Decisions of All-in-One Device with N Components</br><br>Author: Yuwen Chen, PhD Candidate, University of Florida, 902 SW 7th Avenue, Apt. 8, Gainesville, FL, 32601, United States, yuwen@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Asoo Vakharia, Janice Carrillo</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: All-in-one products with many functions have proliferated in the markets. However, the impact of the fusion product on product portfolio decisions has not been investigated. When the fusion technology is available to include all component functions, we identify conditions under which a firm should optimally include only a subset of these functions. While a huge number of portfolios are typically considered, we propose an efficient algorithm to sort out the optimal fusion product portfolio.</br>
