In an effort to manage cost, insurance companies induce patients to choose less expensive medications by making them pay larger copayments for more expensive drugs.  However, drug manufacturers have defended market positions in recent years by offering co-pay coupons. The goal of this paper is to understand the impact of co-pay coupons in a competitive environment with strategic patients.
