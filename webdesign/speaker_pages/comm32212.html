Title: Aggregation of Market Bids in the Smart Distribution System<br>Author: Mingguo Hong, Associate Professor, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Glennan Building 321, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States of America, mxh543@case.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Today the RTO electricity markets support demand-side resources through two primary mechanisms: Demand Response (DR) and Price-Responsive Demand (PRD). This study examines the low to medium voltage distribution networks which serve as pathways for DR and PRD during operation. A bid aggregation strategy is proposed so that both DR and PRD clearings meet the operational constraints of the distribution system. The study addresses the DR and PRD impact to local distribution network security.
