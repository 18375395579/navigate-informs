This study examines the low to medium voltage distribution networks which serve as pathways for DR and PRD during operation. A bid aggregation strategy is proposed so that both DR and PRD clearings meet the operational constraints of the distribution system. The study addresses the DR and PRD impact to local distribution network security.</br>
