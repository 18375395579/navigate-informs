Title: Sequential-Merge Facets for High-Dimensional Infinite Group Problems<br>Author: Santanu Dey, Purdue University, 105 East Oak Street, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, sdey@purdue.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Although numerical and theoretical studies suggest that group cuts like Gomory Mixed Integer Cuts can be significantly improved by considering higher-dimensional groups, the discovery of facet-defining inequalities for high-dimensional infinite group problems has remained an open problem for 35 years. In this paper, we present the sequential-merge operator that creates a very large family of facet-defining inequalities for high-dimensional infinite group problem.
