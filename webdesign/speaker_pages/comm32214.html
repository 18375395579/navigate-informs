Title: On Developing a Business Analytics Course and Major at a Small Business School<br>Author: Eric Huggins, Fort Lewis College, 1000 Rim Drive, Durango, CO, United States of America, huggins_e@fortlewis.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This year I designed and taught a new Business Analytics course which succeeded in a number of ways and failed spectacularly in a few others.  I will discuss my lessons learned and directions for the course in the future.  Further, I am in the process of developing a Business Analytics major and I will discuss my progress so far and seek input from those who have gone before me.
