Title: Aviation Fuel Loading: Efficiency vs. Options<br>Author: Megan Ryerson, Assistant Professor, University of Tennessee, Department of Civil and Environmental En, 113 Perkins Hall, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States of America, mryerson@utk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Airlines uplift fuel in three main categories: mission, reserve, and contingency fuel. Contingency fuel allows aircraft additional holding time or diversion options in case of unforeseen events. However, as fuel is burned simply to carry fuel, this practice can be costly and harmful to the environment. Using airline data, we investigate the magnitude of excess fuel burn due to contingency fuel and trends related to the uplift of contingency fuel.
