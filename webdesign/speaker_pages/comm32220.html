<br>Title: Physician Behavior and Patients' Access to Healthcare with Payer Mix</br><br>Author: Tingting Jiang, Student, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road Room C210, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, tingting-jiang@northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Across the U.S., Medicaid patients' access to healthcare is diminishing. Low reimbursement rate compared with private health plan is usually blamed for physicians?reluctance to accept Medicaid patients. We use a game theoretical model to study the physician’s capacity allocation and investment decisions as the competition for healthcare service intensifies.  We find that physicians may prefer to provide service to patients with low and high reimbursement rates together due to scaled economy.</br>
