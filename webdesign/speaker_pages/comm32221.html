Many governments have attempted to re-create the success of Silicon Valley. However, it is not clear that we know what led to the region’s success, as existing work has not pursued industry-wide firm-level analyses to examine such mechanisms. This work seeks to begin to address this literature gap in order to better inform regional economic development policy moving forward.</br>
