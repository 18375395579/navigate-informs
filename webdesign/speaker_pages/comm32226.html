Title: Knowledge Relatedness and Industry Life Cycle: Evidence from the Early Automotive Airbag Industry<br>Author: Sebastian Fixson, Visiting Assistant Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management, 30 Wadsworth St, Cambridge, MA, United States, fixson@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wonhee Lee<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Linking the concepts of knowledge relatedness and industry life cycle we explore in this paper the dynamic nature of knowledge relatedness by comparing industry pre-takeoff and post-takeoff stages of the automotive airbag industry. We find that while prior to industry take-off firms' inward focus produces more valuable innovations, post industry take-off firms need to explore more across their firm boundaries to produce valuable innovations.
