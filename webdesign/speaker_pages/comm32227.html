Title: Improving the Performance of Monitor Alert: Estimating Delay Distributions for Wheels-up Time<br>Author: Yufeng Tu, Graduate Research Assistant, R. H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, ytu@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball, Wolfgang Jank<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper we present an extension of our previous approach for estimating flight departure delay distributions. Our models include componenets for seasonal trend, daily propagation and day-of-the-week effects.  We also explore flight auto-correlations as a means toward creating a dynamically reactive model.
