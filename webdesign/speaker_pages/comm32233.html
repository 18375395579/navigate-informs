Title: A Multi-criteria Decision Model for Developing Technology Standards in the ICT Industry<br>Author: Ramin Neshati, Engineering Manager, Intel Corporation, 2111 NE 25th Ave, Hillsboro, OR, 97124, United States of America, ramin.neshati@intel.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Firms contribute their own or license others?Intellectual Property (IP) in building standards-based products. How do firms decide whether or not to join a standards organization in the face of IP-related risks? The literature is devoid of a decision model to address this question. Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and data derived from panels of experts representing ICT firms, a robust decision support model is developed that comprehends the critical decision criteria and alternatives.
