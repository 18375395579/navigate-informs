Title: Private and Public Networks: What You Know Versus What You Show<br>Author: David Waguespack, University of Maryland, 4511 Beechwood, College Park, MD, 20740, United States of America, dwaguesp@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Simcoe, Lee Fleming<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Research about superior network positions frequently suffers from the fact that intrinsic and extrinsic explanations are simultaneously loaded on a single observable. A good network position simultaneously deliver better resources and information to the focal actor, making the actor more attractive, but also sends signals to third parties. In this paper we exploit a natural experiment to compare how private network positions and revealed (public) network positions influence future tie formation.
