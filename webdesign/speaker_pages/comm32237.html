Title: Transmission Switching in Power System Operations<br>Author: Jianhui Wang, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, 60439, United States of America, jianhui.wang@anl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Cong Liu, James Ostrowski<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Studies have shown that transmission switching can lead to more operational cost savings. However, modeling challenges remain due to the additional variables and constraints associated with transmission switching. In this talk, I will discuss several modeling aspects related to transmission switching including prescreening, symmetry breaking and static security issues. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
