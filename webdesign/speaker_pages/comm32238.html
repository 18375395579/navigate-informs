<br>Title: Roadblocks to the Efficient Parallelization of Constraint Solvers</br><br>Author: Horst Samulowitz, Research Scientist, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, samulowitz@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ashish Sabharwal, George Katsirelos, Laurent Simon</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: While modern day hardware provides access to 10,000 and more  compute cores, so far parallel versions of combinatorial search  algorithms are unable to effectively exploit more than 20 or so cores.  This talk aims to raise awareness of the fact that the mechanisms  underlying such sequential algorithms can sometimes impose major  bottlenecks to their efficient parallelization.We provide a novel look into the behavior of the founding principles of sequential SAT solvers in a parallel setting.</br>
