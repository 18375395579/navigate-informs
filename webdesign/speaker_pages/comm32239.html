Title: Artificial Intelligence Planning and Operations Research<br>Author: Menkes Van Den Briel, Arizona State University, 699 South Mill Avenue #553, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, menkes@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Vossen, John Fowler, Subbarao Kambhampati<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) planning is concerned with developing automated methods for generating and reasoning about sequences of actions to achieve certain goals. AI planning in its classical form is PSPACE-complete and due to this complexity most of the existing approaches have focused on finding any feasible plan. This presentation is about creating innovative ways for dealing with the inherent computational complexity of AI planning and still being able to produce provably optimal plans.
