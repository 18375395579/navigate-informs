Title: Modeling and Simulating an Adaptive Development Process<br>Author: Tyson Browning, Assistant Prof. of Enterprise Operations, Texas Christian University, TCU Box 298530, Fort Worth, TX, 76129, United States of America, T.Browning@tcu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We model a development project as a complex adaptive system. Instead of prescribing a specific project schedule, we provide a “primordial soup?of activities and simple rules for their self-organization. We simulate thousands of adaptive cases and let the highest-value process emerge. Analyzing these cases leads to several insights. We provide a decision support capability for managers and a basis for new research on agile and adaptive processes.
