<br>Title: Supply-Chain Oriented Robust Parameter Design</br><br>Author: Jye-Chyi (JC) Lu, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30022, United States, jclu@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lingyan Ruan, Na An, David Rosen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This article introduces game theory commonly used in supply-chain analyses to solve potential conflicts between manufacturing partners at various process stages. Through our methods, the partners collaboratively decide settings of controllable variables to make product less sensitive to process noises, especially variations propagated from upstream processes. Modeling and solution strategies of this new research topic are provided along with illustrated examples and comparison studies.</br>
