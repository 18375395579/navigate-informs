Title: Patents in Practice: Systemic Failures of Knowledge Representation in the US Patent System<br>Author: Tony Briggs, Doctoral Candidate, Boston University Graduate School of Management, Information Systems Department, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States, tbriggs@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Carlile<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The US patent system is charged to promote the progress of science and useful arts. While patents are managed as economic devices across firms, they are seldom used as knowledge repositories to shape innovation within firms. We use a knowledge management framework to examine 3 generic patenting practices: development, examination, and enforcement. We find that different practices lead to either knowledge obfuscation or obsolescence, resulting in the systemic failure to inform future innovation.
