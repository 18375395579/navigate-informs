Title: Optimal Design of cDNA Microarray Experiments<br>Author: Nilgun Ferhatosmanoglu, Doctoral Candidate, The Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Avenue, 210 Baker System, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States, ferhatosmanoglu.2@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Theodore Allen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: cDNA Microarray experiments are a key tool in efforts to understand the relationships of genes and diseases.  We propose a generalization of D-efficiency to address model misspecification and explore its benefits for biologists.  Also, we clarify circumstances in which the well known “reference?designs are preferable to “loop?design approaches.
