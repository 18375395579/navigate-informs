<br>Title: Cost-effectiveness of Alternative HIV Vaccination Strategies Among U.S. Risk Groups</br><br>Author: Elisa Long, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, 467 Terman Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, elisa46@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Douglas Owens, Margaret Brandeau</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Efforts to develop an HIV vaccine have become an increasing priority, and several questions exist regarding the efficient distribution of vaccination programs. We examined the effects of alternative HIV vaccination strategies among different US risk groups, including injection drug users, men who have sex with men, and the general population. We present a dynamic compartmental model of HIV transmission and progression and calculate health and economic outcomes of different vaccination policies.</br>
