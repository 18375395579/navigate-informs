Title: File Swarming Systems<br>Author: Milan Vojnovic, Researcher, Microsoft Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom, milanv@microsoft.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: With some peer-to-peer file sharing applications, a data file is disseminated to users by users exchanging file pieces towards downloading the entire file (e.g. BitTorrent in the Internet). Our primary focus is on user file download time and robustness to rare pieces. We ask and provide some answers to the question: How do simple random replication strategies perform? We will also point to some piece replication strategies aiming for data streaming.
