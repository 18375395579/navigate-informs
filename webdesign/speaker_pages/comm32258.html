Title: Pre-Positioning of Emergency Supplies for Disaster Response<br>Author: Carmen Rawls, Graduate Research Assistant, Cornell University, 310 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, cgr7@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Turnquist<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe a two-stage stochastic optimization model for determining locations and amounts of emergency supplies for disaster preparation. The model includes uncertainty in demands, locations, transportation network capacity, and the possibility that some of the pre-positioned supplies might be destroyed by the event. An illustrative case study is included.
