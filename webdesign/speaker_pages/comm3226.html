Title: Finding and Implementing Energy Efficiency Projects in Industrial Facilities<br>Author: Sam Aflaki, HEC, France, aflaki@hec.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Paul R. Kleindorfer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: There are many profitable Energy Efficiency projects in many industrial enterprises that are not implemented.  One of the main barriers often cited as the main culprit is lack of an internal management framework to find, value and execute these projects. Using a conceptual approach, we rely on the existing sustainable operations tools to provide such a framework.  A case example of a large manufacturing site illustrates the details of this framework.
