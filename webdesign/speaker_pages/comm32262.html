Title: A Triple Bottom Line Comparison of Carpet Reclamation Strategies for Urban Regions<br>Author: Caroline Guidry, Georgia Institute of Technology, Systems Realization Laboratory, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0405<br>Coauthor(s): Bert Bras<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The goal of this paper is to compare two end-of-life scenarios for carpet tiles reclaimed from an urban region. The specific focus is on PVC recycling vs. dumping post-consumer carpet tiles in the Atlanta metropolitan region. The comparison of the two strategies will be conducted via a Life-Cycle Assessment, which has been adapted to include economic and social indicators as well. Thus, the comparison of the two end-of-life scenarios will take place from an environmental, social and economic perspective.
