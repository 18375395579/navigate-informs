<br>Title: Behavioral Tendencies in Revenue Management Decision Making</br><br>Author: Bahriye Cesaret, University of Texas at Dallas, Jindal School of Management, 800 W. Campbell Dr., Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, bahriye.cesaret@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elena Katok</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the well known two-class revenue management (RM) problem, and study the problem under three different dynamics. We aim to see how human decision making is affected by the RM problem dynamics, and whether the decision making in RM context is sensitive to framing of the problem dynamics. If there exist any behavioral regularity in RM decision making, we want to know what implications do they have for the RM. We use controlled laboratory experiments as a research tool.</br>
