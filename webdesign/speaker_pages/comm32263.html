We aim to see how human decision making is affected by the RM problem dynamics, and whether the decision making in RM context is sensitive to framing of the problem dynamics. If there exist any behavioral regularity in RM decision making, we want to know what implications do they have for the RM. We use controlled laboratory experiments as a research tool.
