Such marks might limit the extent of help provided to a job seeker because of concerns about courtesy stigma; yet, they might also facilitate help by triggering sympathy. Contrary to intuitive predictions, we argue that—subject to scope conditions—sympathy will dominate stigmatization. Further, we illuminate the double edge of strong ties in this process: while these ties increase motivation to help, they simultaneously intensify the risk of courtesy stigma. Thus, when the job seeker is perceived to be responsible for acquiring a potentially stigmatizing mark, strong ties provide no more socially observable help ?in the form of social capital activation ?than do weak ties. Using a mark that facilitated causal identification (an accident-related scar), an experiment with a diverse population of 483 employed adults validated our hypotheses. We draw important implications for research on stigma, social capital, and labor markets.</br>
