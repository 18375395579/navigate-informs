Title: Which Operational Parameters Matter for the Valuation of Electricity Storage?<br>Author: Yangfang Zhou, PhD candidate, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, United States of America, yangfang@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nicola Secomandi, Jay Apt, Alan Scheller-Wolf, Stephen Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study how the market valuations of three grid-scale battery electricity storage technologies depend on their operational characteristics, such as the number of executable cycles and the magnitude of the charging and discharging rates. We discuss which of these characteristics are most valuable for each technology. We also investigate how the frequency of decision making affects our findings.
