However it introduces an increased death rate from non-HIV related causes. We consider the question of when to start therapy by explicitly incorporating toxicity information into the patient’s health transitions. Using a discrete event simulation we examine how toxicity can lead to delayed initiation of therapy for various starting conditions. We also will discuss possible improvements to the model and future work.</br>
