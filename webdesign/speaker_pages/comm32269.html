Title: Incorporating Toxicity Information in HAART Therapy Initiation<br>Author: Robert Koppenhaver, PhD Student, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, rzk9@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, Steven Shechter, Mark Roberts, R. Scott Braithwaite<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: HAART is very effective in improving key health metrics for HIV patients. However it introduces an increased death rate from non-HIV related causes. We consider the question of when to start therapy by explicitly incorporating toxicity information into the patient’s health transitions. Using a discrete event simulation we examine how toxicity can lead to delayed initiation of therapy for various starting conditions. We also will discuss possible improvements to the model and future work.
