We show that, by operational hedging, SMEs may mitigate capital market frictions, enhance their financing options, and create additional value. The decision for creation of such hedges, however, ought to weigh the benefits of reduced marginal cost of capital and the cost of reduced future growth potential against a status quo.</br>
