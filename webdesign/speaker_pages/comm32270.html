Title: Field Failure Prediction Based on Multi-Level Repair  and System Usage Information<br>Author: Yili Hong, Assistant Professor, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States of America, yilihong@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhibing Xu, William (Bill) Meeker<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Repairable systems in the field often receive repair actions at different levels: system, sub-system, and component level. System usage, environmental information, repair information can be available. We develop a multi-level trend renewal process model to describe the event process for the component replacements, which incorporates information from different levels and explains the effects of factors at different levels. A field failure prediction procedure is developed for the proposed model.
