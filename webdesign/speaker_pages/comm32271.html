<br>Title: Using Global Optimization, Physics and Information Theory in Image Analysis</br><br>Author: Larry Deschaine, Engineering Physicist, SAIC / Chalmers University, 272 Parker Road, Edgefield, SC, 29824, United States, Larry.M.Deschaine@alum.mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Melissa McKay, János D. Pintér, Seth Blanchard, Frank Francone</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This work extends subsurface exploration techniques in geological work by incorporating algorithms and techniques from Information Theory, Physics Based Modeling, Signal Processing/Filtering, Medical Imaging, Machine Learning, Cognitive Modeling and Global Optimization. The result is a method to optimaly define subsurface objects such as plumes and unexploded ordnance.</br>
