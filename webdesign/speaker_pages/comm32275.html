Fowler Avenue, Tampa, FL, United States of America, sprawesh@usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Balaji Padmanabhan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The focus of our presentation is the issue of manipulation in Top-N news recommender systems (NRS). These automated systems are target of manipulators who hire people to promote their articles or apps farther up in the roster. We address the issue of manipulation in NRS through a class of feedback functions and an adapted influence limiter algorithm ?both are used in conjunction. We show that the proposed recommendation technique performs very well to thwart common manipulation strategies.</br>
