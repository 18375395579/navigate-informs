<br>Title: Security Design and Information Aggregation</br><br>Author: Yiling Chen, Yahoo! Research, 45 W. 18th Street, 6th Floor, New York, NY, 10011, United States, cheny@yahoo-inc.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anthony Kwasnica</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: With two differently designed securities, we examine the impact of security design on the information aggregation ability of markets in laboratory experiments. Results show that markets with one security aggregate information signicantly better than markets with the other security, implying that information aggregation ability of markets is affected by the security design. Behavior of individual participants is then investigated to understand the observed market behavior.</br>
