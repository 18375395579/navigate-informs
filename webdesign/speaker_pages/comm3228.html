Title: Product Development Performance Improvement Through Efficient Use of Prototypes<br>Author: Ryan Pereira, D.ENG Candidate, University of Michigan, 2822 Longview Ave, Rochester Hills, MI, 48307, United States, rpereira@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Liker<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The primary purpose of this research is to understand how efficient use of prototypes can enhance PDP.  There is a preference for virtual prototypes but we have also uncovered that excessive reliance on this tool can lead to poor quality.  Literature review shows a gap in knowledge about how firms use prototypes.  Our research will develop propositions on the behavior of successful PD firms.
