Title: Mutual Information Based Matching for Causal Inference with Observational Data<br>Author: Alexander Nikolaev, University of Buffalo, Dept. of Industrial and Systems Engr., Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, anikolae@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lei Sun<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Balance Optimization Subset Selection (BOSS) approach addresses the problem of treatment effect estimation when units under study cannot be randomly selected for treatment. Minimizing mutual information leads to a BOSS model that reduces this selection bias by finding data subsets, across which treatment is minimally dependent on covariates, thus increasing estimation accuracy.
