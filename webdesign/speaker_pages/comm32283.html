<br>Title: Efficient Representation of Data in Support of Situational Awareness</br><br>Author: Artur Dubrawski, Auton Lab, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, NSH 3121, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, awd@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maheshkumar Sabhnani, Josep Roure, Jeff Schneider</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We argue that efficient representation of data can improve situational awareness by enabling: 1) automated exhaustive searches through large datasets for events of interest; 2) automated explanation of these events; and 3) interactive ad-hoc drill-down investigations. We support the claim using T-Cube, a structure designed to reduce response time of queries against time series of counts. Its practical utility is illustrated with applications in food- and agriculture safety, and in logistics.</br>
