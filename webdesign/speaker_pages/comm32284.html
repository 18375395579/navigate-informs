Title: A Proposed Analytic Method for Predicting IED Emplacements<br>Author: Johnathon Dulin, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 771 Fairdale Ct, Castle Rock, CO, 80104, United States of America, dulinj@ctc.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The proliferation of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) over recent years has spawned many efforts to mitigate their effects or disrupt networks; much less attention has been given to predicting emplacement. Observed environmental anomalies may suggest an IED, but improved operational planning can help keep personnel out of harm’s way. By combining the strategic planning of game theory with the policy optimization of MDPs, we have the framework for a new approach in predicting IED emplacements.
