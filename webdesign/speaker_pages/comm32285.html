The focus on early stage deployment creates a methodological challenge due to sporadic usage, possibly leading to spurious results if simple with/without comparisons are made. In an effort to isolate the impact of TMA, an alternate method is employed. We find evidence that TMA did not increase capacity but did reduce capacity variability.</br>
