Nau, Robert L. Winkler</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Scoring rules typically studied in the literature and used in practice do not take account of any ordering of events, and they evaluate probabilities relative to a default baseline distribution.  In this talk, we construct rich families of scoring rules that are strictly proper (thereby encouraging truthful reporting), sensitive to distance (thereby taking into account ordering of events), and incorporate a baseline distribution relative to which the value of a forecast is measured.</br>
