Title: A DEA Study of Sustainable Energy Efficiency in New Zealand<br>Author: Julie Harrison, Senior Lecturer, University of Auckland, Department of Accounting & Finance, 12 Grafton Road, Auckland, New Zealand, j.harrison@auckland.ac.nz<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Rouse, Jennifer Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Our study examines macro-level energy efficiency trends in New Zealand from 1990 to 2009. During this period the NZ government implemented a number of sustainability initiatives, including the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol. We use a DEA model that combines greenhouse gas emissions data and total factor energy efficiency measures. The results show improvements in energy efficiency, with the largest improvements concurrent with the introduction of major government initiatives on sustainability.
