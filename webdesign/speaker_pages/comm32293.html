Therefore, rational models of HIV/AIDS resource allocation have had limited impact on actual spending decisions. We propose S4HARA, decision-support system that takes into account both principles of efficient resource allocation and the role of non-quantifiable influences on the decision-making process for HIV/AIDS resource allocation. We demonstrate S4HARA by an example.</br>
