Title: S4HARA: System for HIV/AIDS Resource Allocation<br>Author: Arielle Lasry, Prevention Effectiveness Fellow, Center for Disease Control, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30333, United States, alasry@cdc.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Carter, Greg Zaric<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: HIV/AIDS resource allocation decisions are influenced by political, social, ethical and other non-quantifiable factors. Therefore, rational models of HIV/AIDS resource allocation have had limited impact on actual spending decisions. We propose S4HARA, decision-support system that takes into account both principles of efficient resource allocation and the role of non-quantifiable influences on the decision-making process for HIV/AIDS resource allocation. We demonstrate S4HARA by an example.
