<br>Title: Hospital Bed Reallocation Problems to Improve Accessibility for Patients</br><br>Author: Mihiro Sasaki, Associate Professor, Nanzan University, 27 Seirei, Seto, 489-0863, Japan, mihiro@nanzan-u.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Takamori Ukai</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In recent years, some regions in Japan have been faced with a severe shortage of medical resources while some others have enough capacity. The size of such imbalances are different in each medical district or type of disease, and directly affects the accessibility for patients to hospitals. One of the major reasons that causes these imbalances is a mismatch between supply and demand. In this paper, we propose mathematical models for reallocating resources so as to reduce accessibility imbalance.</br>
