Title: Deriving Value from Customer Networks<br>Author: Shawndra Hill, Operations and Information Management Department The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500 Philadelphia, PA, shawndra@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: My dissertation addresses the question: How can firms derive value from data on consumer networks? Firms may be able to capitalize on the fact that consumers interact. Firms that collect explicit data on networks of interactions may be able to mine it to increase revenue or to reduce costs. Results of my research show that information in consumer network data improves business outcomes.  In this presentation, I will discuss network-based marketing, a collection of marketing techniques that take advantage of links between consumers to increase sales. Using a large telecommunications data set that represents the adoption of a new telecommunications service, I show very strong support for the hypothesis that network linkage can directly affect product/service adoption. Specifically, I show three main results: (1) Network neighbors-those consumers linked to a prior customer-adopt the service at a rate 3-5 times greater than baseline groups selected by the best practices of the firm's marketing team. In addition, analyzing the network allows the firm to acquire new customers who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks, because they would not have been identified based on traditional attributes. (2) Statistical models, built with a very large amount of geographic, demographic and prior purchase data, are significantly and substantially improved by including network information. (3) More detailed network information allows the ranking of the network neighbors so as to permit the selection of small sets of individuals with very high probabilities of adoption.
