Title: An Analogues-changepoint Methodology for Influenza-like-illness and Drug Sales Surveillance<br>Author: Harriet Nembhard, Associate Professor, Penn State University, Department of Industrial Engineering, 310 Leonhard Building, University Park,, PA, 16802, United States of America, hbn2@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elisabeta Vergu, Bruno Lambert, Clément Turbelin, Wenny Chandra, Antoine Flahault<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We design an SPC analogues-changepoint methodology to monitor French Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI) weekly incidence (clinical data) and support it with multivariate monitoring of weekly pharmaceutical sales (non-clinical data) of 14 preselected medications in ILI context. Our results show that drug sales data provide indirect but earlier indicator of influenza outbreak which could serve as early warning for public health officials.
