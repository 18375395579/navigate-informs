Title: Learning and Technology Adoption: A Structural and Behavioral Analysis<br>Author: Brent Zenobia, Doctoral Candidate, Portland State University, Engineering and Technology Managment, PO Box 751, Portland, OR, 97207, United States of America, bcapps@hevanet.com<br>Coauthor(s): Charles Weber<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: What is the relationship between learning and technology adoption? A case study of alternative transit mode choice suggests that adoption is one member of a family of learning processes which also includes choice framing and technology selection. Structural and behavioral analysis is applied to uncover the properties, dimensions, and behavioral primitives of these processes. Technology adoption and selection are cognitively distinct mental processes with different information requirements.
