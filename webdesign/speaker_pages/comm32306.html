Title: Risk-Sensitive Optimal Breast Cancer Diagnosis<br>Author: Mehmet Ayvaci, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Dallas, Jindal School of Management, 800 West Campbell Road, SM33, Richardson, TX, 75080-3021, United States of America, mehmet.ayvaci@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Oguzhan Alagoz, Elizabeth Burnside<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate the role of risk preferences in the pursuit of optimal diagnostic decisions after mammography. In particular, we develop a risk-sensitive finite-horizon Markov decision process model to maximize total expected utility of a patient where utility in the Von Neumann-Morgenstern sense is defined over quality-adjusted survival duration. We perform sensitivity analyses over the parameters of various utility functions and investigate risk behavior as implied by the clinical practice.
