In particular, we develop a risk-sensitive finite-horizon Markov decision process model to maximize total expected utility of a patient where utility in the Von Neumann-Morgenstern sense is defined over quality-adjusted survival duration. We perform sensitivity analyses over the parameters of various utility functions and investigate risk behavior as implied by the clinical practice.</br>
