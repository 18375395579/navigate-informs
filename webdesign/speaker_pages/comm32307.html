Recently, in-situ electron microscopy has shown promise for the direct observations of nanoparticle growth, but analyzing a large amount of in-situ observations is challenging. We present a method for analyzing the in-situ observations to determine the key characteristics of nanoparticle growth processes, growth/aggregation rates, and particle size distribution as a function of time.</br>
