Title: The Siren's Call of Complexity<br>Author: Enno Siemsen, Assistant Professor of Business Administration, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Business Administration, 350 Wohlers Hall, 1206 S. Sixth Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States, siemsen@uiuc.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We model a product design decision context in which a project manager chooses between designs with different levels of complexity. We show that managers with career concerns will under certain conditions voluntarily reduce their probability of succeeding with a project by choosing a complexity level greater than the minimum necessary to deliver the product’s customer value.
