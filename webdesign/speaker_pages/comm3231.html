As a result of strategic complementary among players' actions, the game has multiple equilibria when the payoffs are common knowledge; however, introducing some uncertainty results in a unique equilibrium. In this paper we provide a characterization of players' equilibrium strategy, and explore its dependence on the network structure.</br>
