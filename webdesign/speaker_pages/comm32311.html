Title: A Hub Infrastructure to Reduce Infusion Pump Medication Errors in Hospitals<br>Author: Kenneth Musselman, Strategic Collaboration Director, Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering, Purdue University, Mann Hall, Suite 225, 203 Martin Jischke Drive, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, kmusselm@purdue.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Reliable, timely and low cost data collection is necessary to achieve a significant reduction in hospital medication errors.  The Infusion Pump Informatics (IPI) System, which was developed using a hub infrastructure, allows infusion pump data to be readily accessible, meaningful and actionable.  Participating hospitals are now forming virtual communities that exchange information, share analysis results, trigger research, and collaborate on ways to improve patient safety.
