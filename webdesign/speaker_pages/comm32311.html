The Infusion Pump Informatics (IPI) System, which was developed using a hub infrastructure, allows infusion pump data to be readily accessible, meaningful and actionable.  Participating hospitals are now forming virtual communities that exchange information, share analysis results, trigger research, and collaborate on ways to improve patient safety.</br>
