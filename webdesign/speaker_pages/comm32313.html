We characterize RGs by looking at co-authorship and assessing the strength and cohesiveness of ties among authors over time, both within and across institutions. With this technique, we track the movement of researchers across co-authorship groups and assess how science self-organizes over several decades and across entire scientific fields. We then explore how the nature of RG relates to performance and impact.</br>
