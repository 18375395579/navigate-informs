Title: The Evolution and Performance of Research Groups<br>Author: Francisco Veloso, Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Baker Hall 131D, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, fveloso@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Leonardo Reyes-Gonzalez<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This work analyzes how research groups (RGs) in institutions are formed and evolve. We characterize RGs by looking at co-authorship and assessing the strength and cohesiveness of ties among authors over time, both within and across institutions. With this technique, we track the movement of researchers across co-authorship groups and assess how science self-organizes over several decades and across entire scientific fields. We then explore how the nature of RG relates to performance and impact.
