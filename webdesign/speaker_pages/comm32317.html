<br>Title: Scale, Scope and Learning in Technological Development</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Macher, Assistant Professor, Georgetown University, G-04 Old North, Washington, DC, 20057, United States, jtm4@georgetown.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper examines how knowledge resulting from firm experience and scale and scope economies affect performance in technological development. Knowledge that results from greater experience within a particular technological area, when combined with knowledge spillovers from greater scope in other technological areas, significantly improves development performance. The results suggest that experience shapes and facilitates firms?abilities to absorb knowledge spillovers.</br>
