<br>Title: Role of Sampling in Physician Learning and Price Discrimination</br><br>Author: Pradeep Bhardwaj, UNC, Chapel Hill, Kenan-Flagler Business School, McColl Building, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, Pradeep_Bhardwaj@unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuxin Chen, Ram Bala</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: While pharmaceutical companies spend significant money on samples, little is known about their effect on physicians and patients. Physicians use detailing information to match the drug with patients, but use sampling in a dual role: by providing a subsidy to uninsured patients and also enabling learning about the patient population. We find that the optimal number of samples has an inverse-U relationship with the number of patients insured and the proportion of patients for whom the drug works.</br>
