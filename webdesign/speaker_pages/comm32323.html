<br>Title: Smart Markets for Water Resources</br><br>Author: John Raffensperger, Senior Lecturer, University of Canterbury, Private Bag 4800, Department of Management, Christchurch, 8140, New Zealand, john.raffensperger@canterbury.ac.nz</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Smart markets hold great promise to help solve the world’s problems of water allocation, nutrient and sediment run-off, and impermeability from new development. In this presentation, I will describe practical solutions that rely on economics, hydrology and O.R. I will present a general framework for hydrological markets, discuss transaction costs, propose realistic institutional arrangements, and compare hydrological markets to the modern markets for electricity.</br>
