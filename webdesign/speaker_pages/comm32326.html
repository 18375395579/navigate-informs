Title: New Railroad Intermodal Systems: Models and Algorithms<br>Author: Teodor Gabriel Crainic, University of Quebec in Montreal, Ecole des sciences de la gestion, C.P. 8888, succ. Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC, H3C3P8, Canada, theo@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Railroads face the challenge of providing high quality service at relatively low cost while generating an adequate level of profit.  Within the intermodal transportation context, railroads are responding by proposing innovative operating policies. We discuss some of these systems and issues and present models and algorithms aimed at planning services, schedules, and the management  of the fleet.
