Title: Studies on the Reliability of Ad-Hoc Networks<br>Author: Jose Ramirez-Marquez, Assistant Professor, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, Jose.Ramirez-Marquez@stevens.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jason Cook<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Ad-hoc networks are employed for the flexibility provided to network users and ease of deployment. The lack of infrastructure allows for the rapid configuration changes because only wireless communication devices are necessary. This attribute violates basic assumptions on which existing reliability methods are founded. This study describes the unique characteristics of ad-hoc networks and current research developed to account for their effects in the determination of reliability.
