Title: Designing Wireless Local Area Networks with Security Considerations<br>Author: Frederick Kaefer, Associate Professor, Loyola University Chicago, Loyola University Chicago, 1 E.

At the same time, security considerations often cause designers of WLANs to limit coverage of areas that are outside of their organizations physical boundaries.  Incorporating restrictions on areas of coverage increases the complexity of design. This research develops a multi-objective model for designing WLANs that address security considerations.
