<br>Title: Systems of Systems Optimization Applied to Simultaneous Aircraft Design and Fleet Allocation</br><br>Author: Paul Frank, The Boeing Company, PO Box 3707, MC 7L-21, Seattle, WA, 98124-2207, United States, paul.d.frank@boeing.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Evin Cramer, John Sabino, Sharon Arroyo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine optimization issues for systems of systems.  This includes addressing the tradeoff of the strength of the central authority versus component autonomy and predictive modeling of components?input-output responses. The problem of simultaneous aircraft design and fleet allocation is used to illustrate a solution approach to these issues.</br>
