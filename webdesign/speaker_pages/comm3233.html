Title: Systems of Systems Optimization Applied to Simultaneous Aircraft Design and Fleet Allocation<br>Author: Paul Frank, The Boeing Company, PO Box 3707, MC 7L-21, Seattle, WA, 98124-2207, United States, paul.d.frank@boeing.com<br>Coauthor(s): Evin Cramer, John Sabino, Sharon Arroyo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine optimization issues for systems of systems.  This includes addressing the tradeoff of the strength of the central authority versus component autonomy and predictive modeling of components?input-output responses. The problem of simultaneous aircraft design and fleet allocation is used to illustrate a solution approach to these issues.
