<br>Title: Searching for Needles in a Haystack: Efficient Intelligence Collection</br><br>Author: Nedialko Dimitrov, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Road, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, ned@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Moshe Kress</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: For intelligence agencies, typically, much more data is available than what can be screened in the allotted time. We formulate the problem faced by an intelligence screener as an exploration-exploitation problem: the screener has to choose between exploring for new sources of information and exploiting known sources. We develop a mathematical model of the collector’s knowledge and examine algorithms that allow the collector to maximize the discovery of relevant data given a time limit.</br>
