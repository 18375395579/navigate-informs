<br>Title: Learning Attacker Strategies in Security Games</br><br>Author: Albert Xin Jiang, University of Southern California, Dept of Computer Science, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, albertjiang@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yundi Qian, Albert Xin Jiang, Emma Bowring, Elizabeth Denicola, Joseph DiRenzo</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Previous work on Security Games has mostly focused on domains where the payoff matrix is known to both the defender and the attacker. However, in many real world domains, the defender may have few ideas about the attacker's payoffs, which is a big issue for the defender when designing her strategies. Fortunately, multiple rounds of plays provide the defender the opportunity to learn those payoffs. In our work, we develop models and efficient algorithms to deal with this new challenge.</br>
