<br>Title: Design and Process Control Issues in Nanomanufacturing</br><br>Author: Babatunde Ogunnaike, University of Delaware, ogunnaike@udel.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This presentation will raise awareness of some key process issues involved in answering the following primary question: in manufacturing products designed for specific end-use applications (e.g. polymer nano-composites); or in the production of self-assembled nanomaterials with desirable structural characteristics (particle size, shape, density, and spatial self-organization); what strategy is required for achieving effective design and control of product properties and for assuring acceptable end-use product performance?</br>
