Although fitting parametric geometric dimensioning and tolerancing features is well established, there has been little prior research on how to utilize the data to discover the nature of nonparametric part-to-part variation patterns that have not been pre-identified and pre-modeled. We propose the use of manifold learning techniques to extract and visualize such information.</br>
