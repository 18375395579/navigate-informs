It is complementary to decision making with imperfect information. Since computer simulation models are capable of looking into the future, they can be used to aid decision makers where information is often ambiguous, but improves as situational awareness improves, such as a disaster scene. This paper develops an integrated disaster simulation system for making appropriate decisions in these situations.</br>
