Title: Science and Engineering of Co-evolving Networks: Population Dynamics, Epidemics and Crisis Response<br>Author: Madhav Marathe, Professor, Virgnia Tech, Virginia Bio-Informatics Inst., 1880 Pratt Drive Building XV, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, mmarathe@vbi.vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Eubank, Anil Vullikanti<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Complex Networks are pervasive in our society.    Recent quantitative changes in high performance and pervasive computing have created new opportunities  for collecting, integrating,  and  analyzing information related to such networks.      The talk will a high performance  computing based crises management system called Comprehensive National  Incident Management System (CNIMS). Applications to  pandemic planning and other large scale human-initiated crisis will be discussed.
