We present a dynamic HIV epidemic transmission model that includes the acute and chronic stages of HIV and parameters for two interacting populations with different characteristics.   We use data from the 1997 Urban Men's Health Study as parameters for the model to study the role that bathhouses and sex clubs play in the epidemic, and we discuss the effects of various policies regarding bathhouses.
