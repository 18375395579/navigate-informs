Title: Convergence of Optimization Instance Languages in XML with Solver API's<br>Author: Bjarni Kristjansson, Maximal Software, 2111 Wilson Boulevard #700, Bjarni@maximalsoftware.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In recent years there has been lot of activity in the development standard languages of optimization instances through XML (OptML, OSiL). In this presentation we will explore various design issues and the benefits of possible convergence with published API's for optimization solvers and how they relate to each other.
