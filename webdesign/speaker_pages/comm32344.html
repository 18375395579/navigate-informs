Title: Using Decision Analysis to Guide Oyster Restoration in North Carolina, USA<br>Author: Richard Anderson, Assistant Professor, Duke University, Box 90328 - Nicholas Sch of the Environ, LSRC A321, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, richard.anderson@duke.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Restoration of North Carolina oysters and the reefs they create involves tradeoffs between ecosystem services and fishery revenue hitherto unquantified for North Carolina.  Quantifications of flows of services derived from oyster reef ecosystems depend on hypotheses about how they depend upon ecological functions.  We develop a decision analytic framework to explore the implications of these considerations for management of North Carolina native oyster populations.
