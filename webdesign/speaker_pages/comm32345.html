Some supply chains make strategic changes after a disruption while others choose to maintain the same strategy.  Using the theory of strategic persistence and an experimental methodology, we will manipulate the impact of a disruption and observe its effect on strategic persistence and relative performance.  This will provide significant managerial insights for determining strategic directions after disruptions.</br>
