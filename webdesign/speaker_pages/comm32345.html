Title: The Impact of Disruptions on Supply Chain Strategy and Performance<br>Author: John Macdonald, University of Maryland, 3411 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, jmacdona@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tom Corsi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Disruptions in supply chains have strategic and performance consequences.  Some supply chains make strategic changes after a disruption while others choose to maintain the same strategy.  Using the theory of strategic persistence and an experimental methodology, we will manipulate the impact of a disruption and observe its effect on strategic persistence and relative performance.  This will provide significant managerial insights for determining strategic directions after disruptions.
