Our analysis allows managers to make informed decisions about how to trade off fairness and efficiency in an operational setting. We use our findings to propose ways of improving the kidney allocation system in the US. Simulation studies suggest that our proposals could lead to an increase of life year gains by 8%, without sacrificing fairness.</br>
