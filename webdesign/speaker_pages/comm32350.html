<br>Title: A Distribution-Free Tabular CUSUM Chart for Correlated Data with Automated Variance Estimation</br><br>Author: James Wilson, Professor, North Carolina State University, Edward P Fitts Industrial & Systems Engineering Department, Campus Box 7906, Raleigh, NC, 27695-7906, United States, jwilson@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joongsup (Jay) Lee, Christos Alexopoulos, Dave Goldsman, K-L Tsui, Seong-Hee Kim</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A distribution-free tabular CUSUM chart, DFTC-VE, is designed to include automated variance estimation so as to detect shifts in the mean of a correlated process.  Extensive experimentation shows that the performance of DFTC-VE compared favorably with that of other competing process-monitoring schemes for correlated processes.</br>
