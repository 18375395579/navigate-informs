<br>Title: Power and Fairness</br><br>Author: Paola Mallucci, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States of America, mallu004@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diana Wu, Tony Haitao Cui</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Understanding what is “fair?is central to research on fairness. While different theories have been proposed to explain how decision makers evaluate the fairness of an outcome, one important characteristic of social interaction, power, is missing from the picture. In this research, we offer laboratory evidence that power has significant impact on what is viewed as fair, and thus it should be incorporated when modeling fairness.</br>
