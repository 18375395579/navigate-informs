Recently, several large companies are interested in using information markets as preference aggregation and group decision-making tools to rank new technologies. We set up two internal preference markets with one market using an additional play-money incentive. Our analysis focus on participant and market behavior, dynamic preference aggregation, and market performance. Results indicate promising expectations.
