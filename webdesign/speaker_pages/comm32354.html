Title: Optimal Exploitation of a Mineral Resource<br>Author: Rene Caldentey, Prof., New York University Stern School of Business, 44 West 4th Str., New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, rcaldent@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rafael Epstein, Denis Saure<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate the optimal long-term operation (extraction and capacity investment strategies) of an underground copper mining project. The resource is deposited over a collection of sites with varying quality and extraction costs. Output is sold in a spot market at a stochastically evolving price independent of the level of production. We apply our methodology to a real instance of an underground copper mining  project.
