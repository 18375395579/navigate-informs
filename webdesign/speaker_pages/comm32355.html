Title: Multimodal Networks in Healthcare Teams<br>Author: Gerald Kane, Assistant Professor, Boston College, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA, 02467, United States of America, gerald.kane@bc.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In many healthcare teams, multiple people and multiple information systems work together to conduct shared tasks.  This paper examines the network structures that emerge as a result of these complex interactions.  It finds that the network structure between both people and informations systems explains performance of the healthcare team in ways that the purely social network or the information systems alone do not.  Implications are discussed.
