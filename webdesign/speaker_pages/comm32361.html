Title: Improving Learning Through the Nurture of Open Source Communities<br>Author: Nile Hatch, Assistant Professor, Marriott School, Brigham Young University, 790 TNRB, Provo, UT, 84602, United States, nile@byu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Monte Shaffer<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Innovation in open source software is a product of individual and communal learning. We describe this process as the organic growth of communities of practice. Interaction between members of different levels of the community facilitates continued innovation and progress in the open source project. It also requires a boundary spanner to facilitate interaction between members of adjacent levels.
