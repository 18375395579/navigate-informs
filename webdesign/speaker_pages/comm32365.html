Title: Two-stage Statistical Model for Predicting Hospital Admissions at Emergency Department Triage<br>Author: Shanshan Qiu, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, United States of America, shanshan@wayne.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alper Murat, Ratna Babu Chinnam<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Research suggests that boarding experienced by ED patients can be reduced if hospital admissions of patients can be predicted right during triage to trigger proactive bed requests and preparations. Using patient information readily available at ED triage, we build a two-stage statistical model that predicts likelihood of patient admission as well as the likely target ward for admission. Results from using EDIS data of Detroit VAMC are very promising.
