<br>Title: Modeling Heavy-Tailed, Skewed and Peaked Uncertainty Phenomena with Bounded Support</br><br>Author: Johan van Dorp, Professor, George Washington University, 1776 G Street, NW, #135, Washington, DC, 29952, United States of America, dorpjr@gwu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A prevalence of heavy-tailed, peaked and skewed uncertainty phenomena have been cited in literature dealing with economic, physics, and engineering data. Herein, the family of Elevated Two-Sided Power (ETSP) distributions shall be presented. We demonstrate that the ETSP family allows for a remarkable flexibility when modeling bounded heavy-tailed and peaked, but skewed, uncertainty phenomena. We present an illustrative example utilizing 2008 US income data.</br>
