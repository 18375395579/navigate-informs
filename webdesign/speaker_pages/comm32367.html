By deploying a mobile EOC with existing HFN comms and power, C2 is enhanced with advanced analytics.  The EOC in a box runs VMware to host a complete Windows and VDI suite. C2 uses ArcServer with 10 TB of local geospacial data for predictive analysis.  Additionally, USHAHIDI Crowdsourcing and Lighthouse Social Networking applicaiton devloped at NPS are hosted.
