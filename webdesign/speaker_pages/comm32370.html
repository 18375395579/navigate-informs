Title: Modeling and Analysis of Evacuation under Highly-dynamic Extreme Weather Events<br>Author: Hasan Manzour, University of Oklahoma, 1013 East Brooks Ave, Apt H, Norman, OK, 73071, United States of America, smh.manzour@ou.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Suleyman Karabuk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We discuss characteristics of highly-dynamic extreme weather events such as tornadoes, in relation to evacuation of people in affected areas. We develop an evacuation model that captures these characteristics and generates a plan that minimizes expected number of injuries. Our model embeds a model of the weather event that probabilistically describes temporal and spatial progress. In the context of a real-world example, we discuss implications, challenges of evacuation under such weather events.
