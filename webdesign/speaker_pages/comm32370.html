We develop an evacuation model that captures these characteristics and generates a plan that minimizes expected number of injuries. Our model embeds a model of the weather event that probabilistically describes temporal and spatial progress. In the context of a real-world example, we discuss implications, challenges of evacuation under such weather events.</br>
