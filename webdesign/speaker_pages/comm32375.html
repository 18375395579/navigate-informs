<br>Title: Sensor Scheduling for Space Event Identification and Characterization</br><br>Author: George Blaha, Senior Principal Systems Engineer, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, 2461 S. Clark St. #1100, Arlington, VA, 22202, United States of America, gblaha@raytheon.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Cox, Michael Schmidt</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Timely identification and characterization of space events (e.g. breakups, maneuvers, conjunctions, dockings) requires effective scheduling of Space Surveillance Network (SSN) sensors.  We present techniques for modeling event characterization peformance and quantifying the need for improved data collection.  Combined with needs-based scheduling, these techniques may be used to develop effective observation schedules. Application to the current and planned SSN architecture is considered.</br>
