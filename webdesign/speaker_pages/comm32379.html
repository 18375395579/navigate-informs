<br>Title: Appointment Management in Presence of Patient & Provider Preferences</br><br>Author: Diwakar Gupta, Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesotta, Twin Cities, MN, United States, guptad@me.umn.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Patients (providers) make different choices when booking (controlling access to) appointment slots. Some patients visit only their designated doctor, whereas others visit any doctor who is available at a convenient time. Some providers routinely double book and work overtime to accommodate urgent demand, whereas others work fixed hours. This talk will summarize author’s efforts to model the resulting booking control problems in several different health care settings.</br>
