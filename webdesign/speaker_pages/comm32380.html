Title: Chaos on a Discrete Assembly Line<br>Author: Donald Eisenstein, University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States, don.eisenstein@ChicagoGSB.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Bartholdi, Yun Fong Lim<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A natural extension of the bucket brigade model of manufacturing is capable of  chaotic behavior in which the instantaneous production rate is, in effect,  random, even though the model is completely deterministic.  This is, we  believe, the first proven instance of chaos in discrete manufacturing.
