Van Wassenhove, Miklos Sarvary</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The new environmental regulations such as European WEEE require accountability for the take-back and proper treatment of used products by the manufacturers. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency conditions for such regulations, identify the problems and provide suggestions for both the social planner and the manufacturers. We discuss the issues of target selection, the impacts of competition, consumer education and cost/benefit ratios on the efficiency of the regulation.</br>
