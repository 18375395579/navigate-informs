Each of these conflict types requires an Army Theater Hospital to handle inflows of different types of patients--soldiers, civilians, children, and elderly--at different rates.  This study analyzes the configuration of an agile Army Theater Hospital that can adapt to changing conflict through modular asset deployment.</br>
