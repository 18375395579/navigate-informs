<br>Title: A Prototype Model for Medical Capabilities-Based Disaster Preparedness</br><br>Author: James Broyles, RAND Corporation, 1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, CA, United States of America, jbroyles@rand.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Melinda Moore, Adam Resnick, Michael Wermuth</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Disaster uncertainties make local planning difficult, but capabilities-based emergency planning is an accepted, effective planning approach.  National guidelines exist for hypothetical disasters that are only specific to an assumed scenario; no research generalizes these guidelines.  This research creates a prototype capabilities-based planning tool and proposes generic planning functions that can be applied to varying disaster types and magnitudes to inform community emergency planning.</br>
