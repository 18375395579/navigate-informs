I carry out an in-depth study of the role played by various actors at a prominent mid-West university ?most notably WARF, its patenting and licensing office ?in supporting the emergence of human embryonic stem cell technology. Through my narrative account, I identify two processes ?which I term protecting and influencing respectively ?that play a key role in building legitimacy for novel technologies. The implications of these findings for theories of institutional entrepreneurship, technological change and technology transfer are discussed.</br>
