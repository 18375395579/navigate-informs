<br>Title: Methods and Their Implications For Inference with Incomplete Information</br><br>Author: Maytal Saar-Tsechansky, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Maytal.Saar-Tsechansky@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Foster Provost</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: What is the best inference policy in the presence of incomplete information? We compare different popular policies for applying classification models to instances with missing values. We show that the two most popular approaches each is preferable under different conditions. Strikingly the approach most seldom mentioned or used consistently outperforms the others, often by large margins. We also discuss the impact of our findings on intelligent information acquisition.</br>
