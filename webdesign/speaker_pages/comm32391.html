Title: Personal Information for a World as We Want it to Be, Part 1<br>Author: William Jones, Associate Research Professor, University of Washington, Suite 400 Roosevelt Commons, Seattle, WA, 98195-2840, United States of America, williamj@u.washington.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Imagine a car with an enormous rear-view mirror and only a tiny windshield.
