It incorporates evacuee behavior models for evacuation recommendation and route guidance. A risk-based routing strategy is adopted that seeks to evacuate the population with the highest risk first by disseminating information to it. It introduces a risk management perspective and also circumvents expensive iterative computation, thereby enabling real-time evacuation operations.</br>
