<br>Title: Calibration of Stochastic Volatility Models: An Optimal Control Approach</br><br>Author: Min Dai, Associate Professor, National University of Singapore, Dept of Math, Singapore, Singapore, matdm@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ling Tang, Xingye Yue</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop an optimal control approach to recover the risk neutral drift term of stochastic volatility which is not assumed to have a special structure. Numerical results and empirical studies are presented. We also reveal that the risk neutral process of volatility recovered from market prices of options is indeed linearly mean-reverting.</br>
