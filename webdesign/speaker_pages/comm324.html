<br>Title: The Interaction Between Knowledge Codification and Knowledge Sharing Networks</br><br>Author: Gautam Ray, University of Minnesota, Carlson School of Management, 321 Nineteenth Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, gautam.ray@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): De Liu, Andrew Whinston</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Current knowledge management strategies advocate two different approaches: codification and knowledge sharing networks. However, limited attention has been paid to the interaction between them. This research draws upon the literature on formal modeling of networks to examine the interaction between codification and knowledge sharing networks. We find that despite the tension between codification and the knowledge sharing network, a firm may still benefit from combining the two approaches.</br>
