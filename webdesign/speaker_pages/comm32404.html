<br>Title: Hazardous Materials Route Generation and Evaluation</br><br>Author: Carl Van Dyke, Partner, Oliver Wyman, 212 Carnegie Center, 3rd Floor, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, Carl.VanDyke@oliverwyman.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Stephens, Dave Hunt</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: New Federal regulations require that all railroads assess the routing of selected HazMat shipments with respect to 27 different attributes.  This includes assessing both historic routings and proposed future routes.  For future routes, up to 2 alternative routes must also be identified, and the best route selected.  This talk will explore the algorithms and methods for finding and assessing these alternate routings.</br>
