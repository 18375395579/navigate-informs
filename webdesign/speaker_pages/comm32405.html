Title: Inventories and Consumer Search Behavior when Product Quality is Uncertain<br>Author: Laurens Debo, Assistant Professor, University of Chicago, 5807 S. Woodlawn Ave., Chiciago, IL, 60637, United States of America, ldebo@chicagogsb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Inventory availability can influence customers' perceptions of product quality, especially with new, unknown or innovative products. Customers who find products out of stock at several retailers may infer that many other customers bought and therefore value it. We develop and analyze a model that allows better understanding of the key determinants of the realized sales when taking such consumer behavior into account.
