This novel type of coordinated research raises strategic challenges in the identification of relevant genomic cancer signatures. We review a framework for integrative cancer genomics which addresses some of these challenges. The proposed approach is rooted in the Logical Analysis of Data methodology initiated by Peter L. Hammer.</br>
