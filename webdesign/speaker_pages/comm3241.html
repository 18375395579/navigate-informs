How do these effects vary across products? We have acquired data on over 26m cars sold in the US over the past ten years. We model the relevant (potentially latent) social groups as well as whether the adoption of a given model by one social group can be explained by previous adoption by another.  We also incorporate spatial effects in our model to address the local effects of social contagion.</br>
