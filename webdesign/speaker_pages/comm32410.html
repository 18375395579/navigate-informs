<br>Title: A Stochastic Model for Hurricane Preparedness and Response</br><br>Author: Richard C. Larson, Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, E40-231b, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, rclarson@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Metzger</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: With an approaching hurricane, government decision makers face a set of action timing decisions: supply pre-positioning, mobilization and evacuation.  The location, time and intensity of the hurricane at landfall are random variables governed by nature. We develop a stochastic dynamic program incorporating economic, social, and logistical impacts of alternative sequential decisions.</br>
