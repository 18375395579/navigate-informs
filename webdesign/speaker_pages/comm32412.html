Title: Multilevel Simulations for Adoption of New Technology: A Potential Tool for Planning and Management<br>Author: Anand N Vidyashankar, George Mason University, 4000 University Drive MS4 A7, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, avidyash@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Nielsen, Jie Xu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Discrete event simulations are effective tools for assessing the trade-off between cost, efficiency, and accuracy for adopting emerging technologies.  We describe multilevel simulations to model the adoption of new technology over current methods in parasitology. We illustrate our approach to the adoption of PCR over larval assay methods for identifying co-infection.  The decision of interest concerns adopting technologies that are accurate and reliable that can be sustained across time.
