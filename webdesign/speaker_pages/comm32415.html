Title: Adversarial Network Analysis<br>Author: Matthew Andrews, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, 700 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, NJ, 07974-0636, andrews@research.bell-labs.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk we study communication networks under worst-case adversarial assumptions on input traffic, topology and network behavior. We focus on how the resulting networking performance differs from that which arises under average-case stochastic assumptions.
