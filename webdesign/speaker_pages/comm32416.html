<br>Title: How Delay Announcements Shape Customer Behavior: An Empirical Study</br><br>Author: Qiuping Yu, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, QiupingYu2009@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gad Allon, Achal Bassamboo</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We explore the impact of delay announcements by studying the data from a medium sized call center, where customers are provided with anticipated delay. Our key insights show that delay announcements not only impact customers' beliefs about the system, but also directly impact customers' per unit waiting cost. Specifically, customers' per unit waiting cost decreases with the offered waiting times associated with the announcements.</br>
