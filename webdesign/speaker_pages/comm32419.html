Tenth Street, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, millsaf@indiana.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Serhan Ziya, Nilay Argon</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: When multiple mass-casualty incidents compete for limited resources, such as ambulances, emergency planners must decide both how to allocate resources and how to prioritize different classes of patients.  Widely used triage protocols, such as START, do not describe how to handle these decisions.  We develop centralized and decentralized prioritization policies that can be effective in such a scenario.</br>
