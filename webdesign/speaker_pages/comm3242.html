Title: A New Modeling Approach for Scheduling Stamping Operations<br>Author: Ada Barlatt, PhD Student, University of Michigan, Industrial & Operations Engineering, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, abarlatt@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Oleg Gusikhin, Yakov Fradkin, Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the challenging problem of scheduling products in an automotive stamping plant. We present a formulation based on complex variable definitions in which each variable represents the activity for a full shift on a given press line. We discuss how this removes significant complexity from the model, how to address the potentially very large number of variables, and how this approach might be extended to address planning problems across a broader segment of the automotive supply chain.
