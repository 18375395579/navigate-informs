This article examines this phenomenon to understand the drivers of effective team decision-making. First, we consider a normative model of group decisions, and we characterize the structure of optimal group decision outcome. Subsequently, we consider the process of group discussion and consensus-building, and we explore how the process of deliberation may introduce biases into the group decisions.</br>
