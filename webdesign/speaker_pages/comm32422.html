Title: Economic Models of Team Decision-making: Are Two Heads Better Than One?<br>Author: Sanjiv Erat, Assistant Professor, Rady School of Management, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States, serat@ucsd.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Firms tend to rely on teams to make many decisions during product development. This article examines this phenomenon to understand the drivers of effective team decision-making. First, we consider a normative model of group decisions, and we characterize the structure of optimal group decision outcome. Subsequently, we consider the process of group discussion and consensus-building, and we explore how the process of deliberation may introduce biases into the group decisions.
