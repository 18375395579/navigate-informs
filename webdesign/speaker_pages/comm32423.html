Worth, TX, United States of America, Rachel.Salvagio@bnsf.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ron Griffith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: With velocity being a constant focus at BNSF Railway, we recently added a component within our Enhanced Service Design (ESD) tool called Visualization Studio that provides design managers information on velocity from a division level and waybill/car level. The product's powerful visual depiction allows users to quickly identify opportunities for improvement.
