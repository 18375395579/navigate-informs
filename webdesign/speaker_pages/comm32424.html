<br>Title: Structuring Intellectual Property: The Case of Carbon Nanotubes</br><br>Author: Mike Lounsbury, University of  Alberta, Michael.Lounsbury@ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): P. Devereaux Jennings, Tyler Wry</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we examine the sources of intellectual property development in the carbon nanotube (CNT) field-one of the most well developed areas of nanotechnology.  While much intellectual property research focuses on patent level analysis, we underscore the importance of patent categories as key cognitive elements that organize the different knowledge domains within the world of CNT patenting. We investigate a number of factors that may contribute to patent creation including spatial characteristics related to geographic clustering and the role of universities and corporations, and knowledge structure characteristics including importance, generality, density, and centrality.  Our results indicate that, at least in the context of the CNT field, spatial characteristics have limited explanatory value, while the knowledge structure characteristics of density of patents within patent categories and the centrality of categories in the overall knowledge structure are robust drivers of patent creation.  We discuss the importance of patent category analysis and the need to seek integration across various theoretical traditions that span socio-cognitive approaches, evolutionary economics and economic geography.</br>
