Title: Regulating Markets for Valuable Waste<br>Author: Gokce Esenduran, Ohio State University, College of Business, 656 Fisher Hall Fisher, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, esenduran_1@fisher.osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Luk Van Wassenhove, Atalay Atasu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Take-back legislation mandates minimum recovery rates for waste products. The recoverable value in waste products may create competition between producer and scavenger, and divert them from landfills even under no legislation. We identify the conditions where legislator should not distort an efficient waste market by  imposing recovery targets.
