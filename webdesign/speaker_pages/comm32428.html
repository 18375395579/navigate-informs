<br>Title: Preventing Orphan Stands in Spatially Explicit Forest Management Planning</br><br>Author: Marc McDill, Associate Professor, Pennsylvania State School of Forest Resources, 310 Forest Resources Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, mem14@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Susete Marques, Jose G Borges</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: For a variety of reasons, in spatially-explicit harvest scheduling models some management units typically will not be harvested within the planning horizon.

We present a multi-objective formulation that minimizes the number of orphan units.</br>
