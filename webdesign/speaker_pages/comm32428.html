Title: Preventing Orphan Stands in Spatially Explicit Forest Management Planning<br>Author: Marc McDill, Associate Professor, Pennsylvania State School of Forest Resources, 310 Forest Resources Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, mem14@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Susete Marques, Jose G Borges<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: For a variety of reasons, in spatially-explicit harvest scheduling models some management units typically will not be harvested within the planning horizon.  Small unharvested management units may be too small to allow a viable harvesting operation, however, leaving these units as unusable “orphans?at the end of the planning horizon. We present a multi-objective formulation that minimizes the number of orphan units.
