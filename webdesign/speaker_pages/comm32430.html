Title: Incorporating Biological Objectives Within Cancer Treatment and Analysis of Dose Escalation Effect<br>Author: Eva K. Lee, Associate Professor & Director, Georgia Institute of Technology, Center for OR in Medicine & HealthCare, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tsung-Lin Wu, Kyungduck Cha<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: MRS can identify regions of the diseased organ that have denser populations of tumor cells.  This talk focuses on our research effort in registering tumor cell spatial information from MRS images to treatment images (Ultrasound/CT), the design of a computerized planning system capable of generating treatment plans with localized hot spots in identifiable tumor regions while maintaining minimal dose to critical and normal tissue, and the potential improvement in tumor control probability.
