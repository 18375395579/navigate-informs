<br>Title: Constructing OnCall Schedules for Medical Residents</br><br>Author: Amy Cohn, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 2797 IOE Building, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, amycohn@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Norman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Over the course of a year, medical residents need to complete several on-call shifts both to satisfy educational requirements and also to meet staffing needs at the hospital. We discuss the complexity of this problem, particularly associated with defining a measurable objective function, and present a solution methodology and real-world results from a major teaching hospital.</br>
