<br>Title: Guilt by Association: Strategic Failure Prevention and Recovery Capacity Investments</br><br>Author: Sang-Hyun Kim, Assistant Professor, Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT, 06511, United States of America, sang.kim@yale.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brian Tomlin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We examine technological systems consisting of multiple subsystems that are interconnected and may undergo cascading failures upon receiving an external shock. Firms managing these subsystems may invest in two measures to enhance system availability: failure prevention and recovery capacity. Depending on whether only one type of investment is made or both are possible, we find that decentralization may lead to either higher or lower system availability.</br>
