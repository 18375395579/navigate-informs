Technical Fellow, The Boeing Company, PO Box 3707 MS 42-50, Seattle, WA, 98124, United States of America, scott.h.mathews@boeing.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Executing well on R&D projects is fundamental to implementing corporate strategic intent and a demanding management task also. New methods and metrics derived from real options technology can provide a mathematical foundation for an engineering-like approach to risk identification and quantification, investment effectiveness, and forward-looking value assessment. These tools enhance the R&D project managers confidence in risk reduction and value shaping through targeted incremental investments.</br>
