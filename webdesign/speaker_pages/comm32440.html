For assessing them, mathematical models are needed, which allow to represent energy systems?evolution over the long term under different policy assumptions (trajectories). We present a dynamic model applied to Spain, which aims at representing realistic trajectories. By realistic, we mean that it takes into account important aspects of energy systems such as imperfect markets, investor’s myopia and risk aversion.</br>
