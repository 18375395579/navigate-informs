Title: Operational Transparency in Face-to-Face Service Settings: The Effects on Customers and Employees<br>Author: Ryan Buell, Assistant Professor, Harvard Business School, Morgan Hall 429, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, rbuell@hbs.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tami Kim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: It has been established that operational transparency improves customer perceptions of value and diminishes sensitivity to waiting in online settings. However, its effects have not been explored in face-to-face settings, where wait times are longer, processes are more variable, and customers can influence service outcomes through their interactions with employees. We present the results of two field experiments and two lab experiments, conducted in food service settings.
