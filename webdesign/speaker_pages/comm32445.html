<br>Title: Decision Support System (DSS) for Planning and Programming Projects in the Construction Industry.</br><br>Author: Miguel Jimenez, FCIMEC, Carrera 53 No.74-86 Office 402, Barranquilla, At, 080020, Colombia, mjimenez@fcimec.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Esneyder Gonzalez, Libardo Gomez, Andres Palmieri, Ricardo Moreno, Diana Ramirez, Fernando Gonzalez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A DSS was developed for a construction company, which considers the Budget, Programming and Control modules. This DSS is in charge of organizing the budget of any project, through the calculation of its estimated unit cost and time per activity. These activities are programmed under multiobjective optimization, where a metaheuristic solution is implemented. In the control module, the activities can be visualized in a PERT diagram by the programmer. Results of projects implemented are shown.</br>
