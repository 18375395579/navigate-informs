Title: Comparison of Measures for Identifying Dispersion Effects in Replicated Factorial Experiments<br>Author: Bruce Ankenman, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences, 2145 Sheridan Road, Box 3119, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, ankenman@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Angela Dean, Cheryl Dingus<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: It is well accepted that variance is seldom constant in simulation experiments.  In this talk, several measures of dispersion are compared for identifying the effects of various factors on the dispersion of a response using factorial experiments.  We compare the power curves for several measures and make recommendations for practitioners for cases of normal and non-normal responses.
