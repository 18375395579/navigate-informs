Title: Value of Information for the Partially Observed MDP and Partially Observed Markov Game<br>Author: Yanling Chang, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, changyanling@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Erera, Chelsea White III<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate the impact of varying state observation accuracy on the value function of the POMDP and POMG, extend key results for the POMDP to the POMG, and show that POMG value function changes due to changes in state observation accuracy can be quite varied and can include discontinuities.
