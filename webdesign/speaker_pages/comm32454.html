<br>Title: In Search of Strategic Consumers at Micro-level: A Discontinuity Study</br><br>Author: Jun Li, Assistant Professor of Technology and Operations, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, junwli@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Serguei Netessine</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present evidence of strategic consumers at micro-level in the air-travel industry using clickstream data. We directly observe consumer arrival and waiting, as opposed to most settings where only purchases are observed. Yet, the difficulty to present evidence of strategic behavior lies in disentangling strategic waiting with non-strategic waiting (indecisiveness). We accomplish this through a discontinuity that we uncovered in pricing and consumers' waiting patterns.</br>
