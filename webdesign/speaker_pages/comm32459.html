Title: Appointment Scheduling under Patient Preference and No-show Behavior<br>Author: Nan Liu, Columbia University, 600 W 168th St., Room 603, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America, nl2320@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jacob Feldman, Huseyin Topaloglu, Serhan Ziya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a model to schedule patient appointments over time. On each day, we decide which appointment days to make available for the patients who raise appointment requests on the current day. Our model explicitly considers patient preference and no-show behavior. We derive the optimal static policies and show that they have a performance guarantee which improves as demand increases. We also develop dynamic policies which utilize the current state information and improve over the static ones.
