On each day, we decide which appointment days to make available for the patients who raise appointment requests on the current day. Our model explicitly considers patient preference and no-show behavior. We derive the optimal static policies and show that they have a performance guarantee which improves as demand increases. We also develop dynamic policies which utilize the current state information and improve over the static ones.</br>
