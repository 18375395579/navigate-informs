Title: Hospital Patient Rescuing Process Analysis: A Markov Chain Approach<br>Author: Xiaolei Xie, Research Assistant, University of Wisconsin- Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Room 3247, Madison, WI, 53705, United States of America, xxie6@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jingshan Li, Yue Dong, Colleen Swartz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, a continuous time Markov chain model is developed to study the patient rescuing process on the hospital floor. Using an iterative approach, steady state probabilities of patient status and provider interventions are obtained and system properties are investigated. What-if analysis is conducted to study the impact of operation changes and derive managerial insights.
