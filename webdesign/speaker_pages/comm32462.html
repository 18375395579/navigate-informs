<br>Title: Lolly’s Restaurant</br><br>Author: Steven Harrod, Assistant Professor, University of Dayton, 1143 Ashburton Dr., Dayton, OH, 45459, United States of America, sharrod1@udayton.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Lolly’s Restaurant is a short, entry level case study for students new to the method of case teaching. The case considers new product development, in this example adding a dinner service to a small, short order restaurant. Operations planning is central to the projections of performance and profitability of the new service. The quantitative aspects of the problem introduce students to service process flows, queuing, and issues of variability in processes. Students must evaluate the business policies and accounts of the restaurant to determine the supporting cost data. The case requires little or no previous Operations Management training, although there are opportunities for more advanced discussions in the case.</br>
