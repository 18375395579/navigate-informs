Title: The Power of Green- EPRI's Green Circuits Distribution Losses Program<br>Author: Karen Forsten, Manager, Engineering Operations, EPRI, 942 Corridor Park Boulevard, Knoxville, TN, 37923, United States of America, KForsten@epri.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Meeting the need for growing power demand and decreasing carbon emissions are two challenges utilities face in today’s business climate. One strategy that can simultaneously satisfy these challenges is to minimize existing system losses. Upgrading existing distribution circuits or changing operating procedures are actions any utility can consider. EPRI will discuss its effort to demonstrate the application of loss reduction technologies and measures and quantify potential loss reduction effects.
