<br>Title: A Game Theoretic Approach to UxV Routing and the Price of Anarchy Associated with Decentralization</br><br>Author: Michael Couche, University at Buffalo, 342 Bell Hall, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, mjcouche@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The use of UxV’s is becoming increasingly popular in the military.

We will then compute the loss of information between these games when compared to a centralized routing framework to identify “best practice?rules when routing.</br>
