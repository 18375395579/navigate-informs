Title: A Taste of the Real World: Senior Capstone Projects<br>Author: Susan Martonosi, Harvey Mudd College, Department of Mathematics, Claremont, CA, United States of America, martonosi@hmc.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A senior capstone is a project conducted during a student's final year, whose intention is to synthesize material learned in the classroom.  For 50 years, the Harvey Mudd College Clinic Program has been a capstone experience in which teams of undergraduates work on a real-world problem of interest to a sponsoring organization.  Over 1400 projects have been completed, many of them related to operations research.  This talk will provide an overview of the program and suggest best practices.
