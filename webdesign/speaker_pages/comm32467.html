Title: Detection of Physiologic Condition Changes Based on Synchronization Patterns<br>Author: Qiang Huang, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, huangq@eng.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hui Wang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in physiologic systems. It has long been recognized as an important mechanism by which the brain codes and processes information. Defining “synchronization patterns?of neuronal groups under different physiologic conditions may provide great implications to health condition monitoring and treatment of neurological diseases. This study presents a method to detect synchronization changes using a new nonlinear dynamics model.
