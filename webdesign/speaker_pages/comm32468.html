However, few SMEs can master the innovation process alone because research capabilities are scarce. Cooperations are seen as a solution for this obstacle.   We surveyed 150 SMEs regarding innovation cooperations with other firms and research institutes. The aim of our study is to find out how innovation can emerge from cooperations and how to foster this process.
