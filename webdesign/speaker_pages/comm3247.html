Title: Combining the Intuitive and Analytic Mind<br>Author: Jack Soll, Associate Professor, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, jsoll@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rick Larrick<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We show the benefits of having the same individual make a rapid intuitive judgment and a slower deliberate judgment, and then averaging them. There is an asymmetry, however, such that the intuitive-analytic sequence allows for greater “refreshing?and bracketing than the reverse sequence. Similar benefits occur when combining strategies across people. We discuss the implications for debiasing strategies.
