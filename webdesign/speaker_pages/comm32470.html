Title: Efficiency vs. Equity in Dynamic Air Traffic Flow Management<br>Author: Amedeo Odoni, Professor, M.I.T., 77 Massachusetts Avenue 33-219, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, arodoni@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Hanowsky<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The tradeoff between efficiency and equity/fairness presents a major challenge for ATFM optimization models.  Recent work on dynamic ground delay programs under uncertainty highlights the issues involved.  Efficient solutions may be strongly biased with respect to flight distance and, by implication, airline and aircraft type.
