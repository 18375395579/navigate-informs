Title: Controlling Energy Consumption in Data Center Servers: An MDP-based Approach<br>Author: Arupa Mohapatra, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, arupa@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cesar Mateus, Natarajan Gautam<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Server energy consumption in data centers has skyrocketed recently. In this research we propose to develop control policies to power servers on and off, as well as determine their operating speeds to improve energy-efficiency. We develop a Markov decision process model to characterize the optimal policy, develop insights on its structure, and describe methods to expeditiously obtain them for large problem instances.
