CMieux combines novel techniques for dynamic procurement and bidding with an architecture to tightly coordinate these activities. We present and analyze empirical results based on 200 games involving agents entered by 25 different teams during what can be seen as the most competitive phase of the 2005 tournament as well as more recent results from May 2006.
