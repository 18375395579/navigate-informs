Title: Sourcing Strategy and High Impact Low Probability Disruption Response: Theory and Experiment.<br>Author: Kyle Goldschmidt, Pennsylvania State University, 426A Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, khg116@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Douglas Thomas, Christopher Craighead, Mirko Kremer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study sourcing decisions in the context of high-impact, low-probability supplier disruptions. We identify two significant biases: 1) over long periods without supply disruptions, decision makers gradually reduce their supply base; and 2) after experiencing a disruption, decision makers re-adjust their supply base according to the severity of the disruption.
