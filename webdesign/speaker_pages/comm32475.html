It empowers individual patients and caregivers to exert control over how healthcare happens.  It employs a robust new technological foundation that allows people to connect, collaborate, and coordinate in new ways.  Involving presentations from industry and academia, this panel explores how Health 2.0 could fundamentally change healthcare delivery in the US.
