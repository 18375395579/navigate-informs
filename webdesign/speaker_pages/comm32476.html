<br>Title: Coordination and Performance of Engineers in New Product Innovation</br><br>Author: Bilal Gokpinar, Assistant Professor, University College London, Management Science and Innovation, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, bilal@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seyed Iravani, Wallace Hopp</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this empirical study, we investigate the role of organizational networks in new product innovation. Our results suggest that design engineers who have more coordination links to their peers perform better, but that it takes longer for them to resolve design issues.   We discuss how this insight may help managers improve the design process along both the speed and quality dimensions.</br>
