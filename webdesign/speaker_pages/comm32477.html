Rivera, Associate Professor, Arizona State University, Mail Stop 876006, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287-6006, United States of America, daniel.rivera@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Linda M. Collins</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The talk will discuss how control engineering can be applied to optimize adaptive interventions for prevention and treatment of chronic, relapsing behavioral disorders such as substance abuse, mental illness, and obesity. Adaptive interventions are feedback systems that individualize therapy using decision rules that assign dosages and forms of treatment over time.  A hypothetical example based on a real-life intervention designed to reduce conduct disorder in at-risk children will be presented.</br>
