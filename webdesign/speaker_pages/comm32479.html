Their ability to recover quickly is key. Determining how to respond and assess progress after such events offer serious challenges for decision makers. In light of this, we present a problem formulation for decision support for metropolitan emergency disaster response planning.  The model is based on critical infrastructure states, interdependencies, and response over time.
