Title: Application of Game Theory Under Repeated Market Play<br>Author: Gerald Sheble, Maseeh Professor, Portland State University, 1900 SW 4th Ave, Ste 160, Portland, OR, 97201, United States of America, gbsheble@pdx.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Auction Markets simulation is standard to successful application of Game Theory to repeated auction market strategies.  Repeated auction plays in the energy industry are based on the expected value of future plays.  The linking of expected future outcomes to the daily bid/offer is investigated by this paper.  Spreadsheet analysis is extendable to markets when there is constant movement of commodities through the supply chain and the equipment life cycle is expressed in decades instead of years.
