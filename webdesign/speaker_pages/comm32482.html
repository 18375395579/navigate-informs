Title: Impact of Multiple First-line Therapies on Resistance and Supply Chain in Resource Poor Settings<br>Author: Prashant Yadav, Professor of Supply Chain Management, MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, Gomez Laguna 25, Zaragoza, AR, 50009, Spain, pyadav@zlc.edu.es<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The adoption of multiple first line therapies for infectious diseases delays the emergence of drug resistance but leads to significant additional costs of variety in the supply chain. In resource poor environments, the benefits from delayed drug resistance are not internalized by decision makers. This results in socially sub-optimal selection of drug variety in the system. We explore models that incentivize the decision maker in resource poor settings to adopt multiple first line therapies.
