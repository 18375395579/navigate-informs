Title: An Integer Programming Model for Controlling Urban Sprawl<br>Author: Piyush Kumar, University of Texas at Arlington, 416 Yates St., Arlington, TX, United States of America, piyush.kumar@mavs.uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Sprawl has a detrimental effect on quality of life and the environment. Ewing et al. (2002) defined measures of sprawl in the present urban structure. In this research, we develop an integer programming model to optimize land usage subject to sprawl constraints, which are based upon the sprawl measures. We describe heuristics and a Dantzig-Wolfe method to solve the model. Finally, we discuss topics of future research.
