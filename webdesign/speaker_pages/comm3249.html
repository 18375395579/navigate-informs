<br>Title: Analyzing Effect of U.S. Natural Gas Exports on the Global Gas Markets</br><br>Author: Steven Gabriel, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States of America, sgabriel@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seksun Moryade, Hakob Avetisyan, Vincent BRIAT</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: U.S. natural gas companies aim to export natural gas to global markets because of growing domestic natural gas supply and relatively low prices compared to other foreign natural gas markets. In this presentation, we investigate effects of exporting U.S. natural gas to Asia and Europe.  We also take into consideration the effects of uncertainty of shale gas production in China in addition to carbon policy scenarios as part of University of Maryland’s World Gas Model.</br>
