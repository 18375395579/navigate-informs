Title: Impact of Digital Whiteboard Notes on Student Perceptions of Learning in a Graduate OR/MS Course<br>Author: Jill Hardin, Virginia Commonwealth University, 1001 W. Main St., PO Box 843083, Richmond, VA, 23284-3083, jrhardin@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Nugent<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss the use of a Tablet PC in a graduate OR/MS course which some students attend virtually through satellite link.  The Tablet PC served as a digital whiteboard and the resulting notes were posted in PDF format for student reference.  We report results of a survey designed to assess the value of these digital whiteboard notes to students.  The survey also asked questions about students' self-perceptions of learning. Preliminary results indicate that the impact is positive.
