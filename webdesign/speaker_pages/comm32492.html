Title: The Design of Multi-Stage Service Processes<br>Author: Stelios Kavadias, Professor, Cambridge Judge Business School, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, United Kingdom, sk747@hermes.cam.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Ioannis Bellos<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Motivated by the practices of design firms we build on the customer journey concept, which describes services as multi-stage processes. We develop a parsimonious model and we analyze the provider's decisions on the amount of effort she exerts at each stage of the process and the overall price she charges.
