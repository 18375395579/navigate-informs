<br>Title: Evolution of an Optimization Software Project in a Production Environment: Lessons Learned</br><br>Author: Matthew Hoffman, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800, MS 1188, Albuquerque, NM, United States of America, mjhoffm@sandia.gov</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We apply a mixed-integer programming tool to portfolio-level defense acquisition problems, which selects modernization plans to maximize future fleet performance under budget, production, and programmatic constraints.  As the project has evolved in a constantly changing high-impact analysis environment we have gained insight into process, architecture, and capabilities that help us adapt quickly to changes in data or key assumptions while maintaining high levels of confidence in analysis output.</br>
