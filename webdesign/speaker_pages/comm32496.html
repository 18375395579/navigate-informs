<br>Title: Percentile Optimization for Markov Decision Processes with Parameter Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Erick Delage, Ph.D Candidate, Stanford University, 350 Serra Mall, Stanford, Ca, 94305, United States, edelage@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shie Mannor</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Since the parameters of Markov decision processes are typically estimated from data or learned from experience, the actual performance of a chosen strategy often significantly differs from the designer's expectations due to modeling ambiguity. We present several percentile criteria that can represent the tradeoff between optimistic and  pessimistic point of views on the question. We outline solution concepts that take reward and transitions uncertainty into account for decision making.</br>
