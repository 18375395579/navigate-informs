Title: The Evolution of Technological Paths and Market Value<br>Author: Kun Liu, Assistant Professor, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, United States of America, k_liu@wsu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate how the evolution of technological path affects the firm's market value. We suggest that innovations of the same technological paths are genealogically related, which allows the firm to better protect and appropriate value from its intellectual property rights. Our results show that such superior position of appropriating value from intellectual property rights increases the firm's market value.
