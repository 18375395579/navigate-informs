<br>Title: Computational Global Optimization</br><br>Author: János D. Pintér, President  and Research Scientist, Pinter Consulting Services Inc., 129 Glenforest Drive, Halifax, NS, B3M 1J2, Canada, jdpinter@hfx.eastlink.ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Global optimization ?the task of finding the best possible solution in multi-modal problems ?is one of the toughest numerical challenges. The theoretical foundations of GO have been followed by algorithmic advances and recent software implementations for compilers, spreadsheets, modeling languages and integrated computing systems. In this talk we review these developments, and illustrate both the current state-of-the-art and some significant areas in need of GO technology.</br>
