We analyze an infectious disease model to determine the optimal allocation of the stockpile between prevention and treatment.  We characterize the optimal solution analytically.  Allocating current national antiviral stockpiles to treatment are likely to minimize population mortality.  But, with much larger stockpiles, using antivirals for prevention may be optimal.</br>
