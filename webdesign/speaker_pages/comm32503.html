Mitchell<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Based on cases from the semiconductor industry, we build a model of intellectual property (e.g., software) reuse. We consider designer skills, a reuse repository, and the role of quality standards and incentives. Our results highlight a tradeoff between quality standards motivating reuse while reducing incentives for building new repository contributions.
