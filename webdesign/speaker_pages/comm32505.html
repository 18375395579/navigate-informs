Title: Operational Flexibility in Forest Fire Suppression and Prevention<br>Author: Abílio Pacheco, INESC Porto, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, 378, Porto, 4200-465, Portugal, abilio.pacheco@fe.up.pt<br>Coauthor(s): João Claro<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We model intra-annual fire management as a problem of multistage capacity investment in a portfolio of management resources, enabling fuel treatment and fire suppression. We consider wildfires as the demand, with uncertainty in the severity of the fire season and in the occurrence, time, place, and severity of specific fires. We focus our analysis on postponement flexibility (fuel treatment, suppression), spatial flexibility (helicopters, ground crews) and the risk of supply and demand mismatch.
