We consider wildfires as the demand, with uncertainty in the severity of the fire season and in the occurrence, time, place, and severity of specific fires. We focus our analysis on postponement flexibility (fuel treatment, suppression), spatial flexibility (helicopters, ground crews) and the risk of supply and demand mismatch.</br>
