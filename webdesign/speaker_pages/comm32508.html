We present a multi-period capacity management model where we distinguish between process and operational flexibility. Our results reveal that myopic policies may lead a firm to adopt more process flexibility. That is, process flexibility may be over-valued in the literature since it is assumed that a firm will operate optimally after the process flexibility decision.</br>
