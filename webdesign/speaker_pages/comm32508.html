Title: Managing Capacity Flexibility in Make-to-Order Production Environments<br>Author: Fehmi Tanrisever, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, 5612, Netherlands, f.tanrisever@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): David Morton, Douglas Morrice<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We address the problem of managing flexible production capacity in an MTO manufacturing environment. We present a multi-period capacity management model where we distinguish between process and operational flexibility. Our results reveal that myopic policies may lead a firm to adopt more process flexibility. That is, process flexibility may be over-valued in the literature since it is assumed that a firm will operate optimally after the process flexibility decision.
