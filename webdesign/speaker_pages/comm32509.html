Furman, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Ave - 653a, Boston, MA, 02215, United States, furman@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fiona Murray, Scott Stern<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper evaluates the impact of restrictions on the use of  embryonic stem cell lines in US Federally funded scientific research  on the geography of scientific discovery. It exploits an exogenous   shock to the process of step-by-step scientific discovery to assess  the sensitivity of regional scientific agglomeration to a temporary  revision in the knowledge production process.
