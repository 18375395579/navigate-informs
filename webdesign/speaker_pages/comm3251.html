Title: Active Feature Learning for Medical Diagnosis<br>Author: Chih-Lin Chi, Ph.D student, Health Informatics Program, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, chih-lin-chi@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nick Street<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present an active machine learning algorithm to support triage decisions in medical diagnosis. The algorithm actively determines the next medical test required based on a patient's known features. Specialized classifiers are used to reduce the number of diagnostic tests required, resulting in faster, less costly, and more accurate decisions.
