<br>Title: Probability Calculation for Tournament Format of World Baseball Classic</br><br>Author: Nobuyoshi Hirotsu, Associate Professor, Juntendo University, 1-1 Hiragagakuendai, Inzai, 270-1695, Japan, n_hirotsu@sakura.juntendo.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Suzaki Masabumi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The first World Baseball Classic (WBC) in 2006 employed a round-robin format in the round 1 and 2. Because of complicated tiebreaking procedures, the second WBC in 2009 introduced a double-elimination format. In this format, however, some teams played each other too many times such that Japan and Korea played 5 times. Here, the probability of the number of times a team plays every other team is calculated, and an effect of the modification of this format for the third WBC in 2013 is discussed.</br>
