Because of complicated tiebreaking procedures, the second WBC in 2009 introduced a double-elimination format. In this format, however, some teams played each other too many times such that Japan and Korea played 5 times. Here, the probability of the number of times a team plays every other team is calculated, and an effect of the modification of this format for the third WBC in 2013 is discussed.
