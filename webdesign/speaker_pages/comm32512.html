We use regression analysis and data from the 04 MLB season - frequency of particular events (hits, homeruns, etc.) for individual pitcher/batter matchups and the frequency of the event for individual pitcher and hitters over the entire season - to assess relative influence of the pitcher and the batter.</br>
