Title: Emergency Preparedness and Robustness to Uncertain Population and Workforce Behaviors<br>Author: Elizabeth B. Connelly, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States of America, ec5vc@virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Lambert, Jose Orlando Gomes<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Emergency managers can have mistaken assumptions of future population and workforce behaviors, in terms of their personal preparedness and their actions in emergencies. It is essential to understand the robustness of emergency plans to the variety of such behaviors. This talk will describe several case studies that model and evaluate the implications of population and workforce behaviors for risk management and emergency management in Washington, DC, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
