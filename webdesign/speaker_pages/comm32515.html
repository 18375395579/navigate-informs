<br>Title: Estimating the Potential Benefits of Banning Drivers?use of Hand-held Wireless Devices</br><br>Author: Douglas King, Visiting Lecturer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, 117 Transportation Bldg., 104 S. Mathews Ave., Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, dmking@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Robbins, Sheldon Jacobson, Kevin Ryan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Hand-held wireless devices (e.g., cell phones) are considered a distraction to drivers, leading many states to ban drivers from using them. This talk examines how accident rates at the county level have evolved over time in New York and Pennsylvania to assess the potential impact of such legislation. These results suggest that the impact of these bans is associated with the driver density in a county, defined as the number of licensed drivers per centerline mile of roadway.</br>
