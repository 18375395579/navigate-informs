<br>Title: A Threshold Probability Approach to Risky Project Selection with Joint Resource Constraints</br><br>Author: Alan King, IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center, PO Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, kingaj@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dharmashankar Subramanian, Paul Huang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The optimal selection of portfolios of risky projects involves balancing current costs against the probable range of future returns.  Projects can be ranked according to the implied expected value of project continuation.  In this talk we offer a ranking model that accounts for the fact that projects may consume limited resources or there may be dependencies between projects.</br>
