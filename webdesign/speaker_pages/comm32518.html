Using individual-level web visitation and transaction data in the air-travel industry, we are able to observe not only the time of purchase but also the length of waiting before committing to a purchase. The study reveals a cyclical pricing pattern in the air-travel industry, and sheds light on the optimality of such pricing strategy based on the corresponding waiting patterns observed from strategic consumers.
