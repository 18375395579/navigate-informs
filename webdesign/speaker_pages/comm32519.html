Title: Hogging the Credit and Assigning Blame: The Role of Outcomes & Nature of Group Task<br>Author: Sanjiv Erat, University of California at San Diego, serat@ucsd.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The old adage that “success has many fathers while failure is an orphan?is one proposition that not many managers would disagree with. Still, the empirical studies that have tested this proposition, have found evidence for it mixed.    In this paper, I shall analytically develop and empirically test a set of propositions that link the nature of the group task and the task outcome to the degree to which each group member claims credit for success (or assigns blame for failure).
