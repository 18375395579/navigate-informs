These publishers often give impression guarantees that complicate the delivery system due to the need to manage inventory. I will describe a delivery system that allows targeting of both groups of pages (e.g., sports pages) and information about the people browsing the content (e.g., males from Seattle). The system learns a Bayesian network from web-traffic data to predict inventory of the targetable attributes.</br>
