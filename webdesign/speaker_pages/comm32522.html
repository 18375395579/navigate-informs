<br>Title: Does Forgetting Affect Vendor Quality Performance? ?An Empirical Investigation</br><br>Author: Suresh Muthulingam, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, 401p Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, sm875@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anupam Agrawal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We examine how forgetting impacts the quality performance of vendors using data on 2,732 quality improvement initiatives undertaken by a manufacturer at its vendors. Forgetting depreciates over 13% of quality gains obtained from quality improvement initiatives (induced learning) and over 16% of quality gains from learning-by-doing (autonomous learning) every year. We also highlight which type of quality initiatives lead to sustained quality gains and shed new light on quality management.</br>
