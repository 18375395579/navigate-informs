Title: Problems in Air Transportation<br>Author: Michael Ball, Professor, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, mball@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: As air transportation demand creeps closer to system capacity, congestion and associated poor service levels are becoming widespread, particularly in the US and Europe. Addressing this global problem involves fundamental systems questions and as such clearly falls within the domain of operations research. We define several specific challenges including construction of highly reactive control mechanisms, integrating technical and economic controls and modeling and quantifying safety.
