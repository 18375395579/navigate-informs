<br>Title: Strategic Pacing and the Progress Trap of IT Innovations</br><br>Author: Dr. Pratim Datta, Kent State University, A408 M&IS, Kent, OH, 44236, United States of America, pdatta@kent.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sergei Anokhin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Is the current pace of IT innovations too much of a good thing? The paper argues that there is a progress trap of IT innovations where too many innovations too fast may lead to diminishing returns on R&D efforts. Unless firms strategically “pace their IT innovations (both incremental & radical) by controlling timeliness & diversity of IT innovations, firms will fall prey to a progress trap through execution shortfalls, cannibalization, low shelf life, & competence rigidity.</br>
