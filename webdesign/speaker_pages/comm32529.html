Often, patient demand exceeds bed availability. In such cases, current ICU patients may be discharged early in order to accommodate more urgent patients. This may increase the likelihood of readmission to the ICU. We examine data of 10 ICUs, showing the extent of this phenomena, and examine how different policies affect ICU availability using a state-dependent queueing network.</br>
