Title: A Simulation-Based Optimization Model for Dynamic Resource Utilization at Federal and Local Levels During Cross-Regional Pandemic Outbreaks<br>Author: Alex Savachkin, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, Dep. of IMSE, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, savachki@eng.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andres Uribe, Tapas K. Das, Diana Prieto<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Optimal dynamic allocation of limited resources at the federal and local levels during emergence of a multi-city pandemic outbreak is an open research challenge. We develop a simulation based two-tier optimization strategy for allocation of vaccines, antiviral drugs, medical personnel, and hospital beds, to minimize the total cost of the pandemic.
