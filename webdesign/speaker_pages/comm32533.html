Title: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Layering Facilitates Analysis and Interpretation<br>Author: Turkan Gardenier, Director of Research, Pragmatica Corp., 115 Saint Andrews Drive NE, Vienna, VA, 22180, United States of America, gardeniert@yahoo.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has emerged as a new scientific discipline in addressing many important environmental and energy-related challenges.  By enabling data integration from a multitude of sources and, through the layering feature to display such data on a map, GIS is able to identify hot spots for further exploration and analysis.  Interpretability, relative to bivariate and multivariate association, is approached in this presentation, using a Trinomial-oriented framework.
