Title: A Stochastic Modeling Approach to Field Cancerization<br>Author: Marc D. Ryser, Duke University, United States of America, ryser@math.duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jasmine Foo, Rick Durrett, Kevin Leder<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In many epithelial cancers, the presence of undetectable pre-malignant cell clones increases the risk of recurrence after excision of the primary tumor, and can lead to synchronous or metachronous multifocal cancer lesions. We develop a stochastic model of these field cancerization dynamics and estimate quantities such as waiting times until emergence of cancer, geometry of pre-malignant fields, and recurrence risk. We illustrate our results on the specific example of oral cancer.
