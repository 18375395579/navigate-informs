Ryser, Duke University, United States of America, ryser@math.duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jasmine Foo, Rick Durrett, Kevin Leder</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In many epithelial cancers, the presence of undetectable pre-malignant cell clones increases the risk of recurrence after excision of the primary tumor, and can lead to synchronous or metachronous multifocal cancer lesions. We develop a stochastic model of these field cancerization dynamics and estimate quantities such as waiting times until emergence of cancer, geometry of pre-malignant fields, and recurrence risk. We illustrate our results on the specific example of oral cancer.</br>
