<br>Title: Global Tourism on the Edge of Chaos?</br><br>Author: Sam Cole, Professor, SUNY Buffalo, Hayes Hall, Main St Campus, Buffalo, NY, 14214, United States of America, samcole@buffalo.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper explores suggestions in the literature that the tourism industry is chaotic by transforming a previously developed model of the resort life cycle to a discrete logistic equation. The results suggest that globalized industries, such as tourism, may exhibit quite different dynamics from those captured by traditional growth models or localized supply-demand models. The implication of such findings and directions for further research are indicated.</br>
