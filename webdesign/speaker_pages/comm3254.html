Title: Inventory Optimization in Clinical Trial Supply Chains<br>Author: Yao Zhao, Associate Professor, Rutgers Business School, 1 Washington Park, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, yaozhao@andromeda.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anh Ninh, Adam Fleischhacker<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: One bottleneck in clinical trials is the slow patient recruitment. Companies typically address this issue by recruiting patients globally, which, however, resulted in significant overages of clinical supplies. In this study, we introduce a class of mathematic models to capture the unique attributes of clinical trial supply chains. We show how to optimally position inventory in such supply chains, and test the effectiveness of the model in a real-world example.
