<br>Title: Value of Flexibility in Oil and Gas Projects; The Case of Deferral Options</br><br>Author: Babak Jafarizadeh, Statoil, Svanholmen 8, Sandnes, 4313, Norway, bajaf@statoil.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The timing flexibility of investments may entail extra value for oil and gas companies.

In this paper, we discuss investments with long or short-term outcome realizations and conclude that the value of deferral options tend to be higher for decisions with an earlier outcome realization.</br>
