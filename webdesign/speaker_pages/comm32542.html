Michael Harrison</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by applications in oil exploration and investment, we consider a firm that can use one of several costly learning modes to dynamically explore the economic viability of a project. In addition to dynamic decisions about its learning mode, the firm must decide when to stop learning and either invest or abandon the project. Using a continuous-time Bayesian framework, we solve both the discounted and undiscounted versions of this problem.</br>
