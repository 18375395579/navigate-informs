Robin Keller</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Decisions with health outcomes involve some interesting theoretical and modeling issues when incorporating multi-attribute utility.  These decisions arise frequently in the medical domain, but also in regard to personal lifestyle choices.  It is possible to formulate a reasonably straightforward expected utility model, provided that we impose some conditions on the preferences of the decision maker.  These conditions help determine the types of contexts for which the model will be valid.</br>
