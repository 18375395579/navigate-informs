Title: Bidding under Budget Constraints in Online Advertising: Shading versus Throttling<br>Author: Santiago Balseiro, Assistant Professor, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States of America, srb2155@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Omar Besbes, Gabriel Weintraub<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Online advertisers typically run campaigns with a fixed budget. A common practice to control expenditures and ensure smooth depletion of budgets is the use of throttling, in which advertisers do not participate in a fraction of the auctions. In this talk, we propose bid shading as an alternative, in which advertisers participate in all auctions but lower bids to account for the option value of future opportunities. We compare the auctioneer’s revenue and advertisers?surplus of both approaches.
