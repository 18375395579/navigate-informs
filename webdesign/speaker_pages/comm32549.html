Title: Screening Capacity Analysis for Preliminary Passenger Rail Planning<br>Author: Edwin R Chip Kraft, TEMS, Inc., 116 Record Street, Frederick, MD, 21701, United States of America, ckraft@temsinc.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A recent TRB study developed a new methodology for estimating capacity needs for adding passenger trains to a freight rail line. This involves developing a passenger schedule, then adding freight trains to identify conflicts.  Infrastructure needs can then be estimated.  This first step gives planners an approximate estimate of the infrastructure need. This presentation describes this methodology and its role in the capacity planning process.
