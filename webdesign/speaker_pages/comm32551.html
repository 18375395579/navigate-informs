Title: How Should We Design Primary Care Physician Panels?<br>Author: Hari Balasubramanian, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 160 Governors Drive, Amherst, MA, United States of America, hbalasubraman@ecs.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ritesh Banerjee, Brian Denton<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a conceptual framework to help determine the optimal size and composition of physician panels in primary care. Our objectives are two key but conflicting measures for any practice: timely access, which provides patients with appointments whenever they need care; and continuity of care, which tries to have patients see their own assigned physician and develop a long-term patient-physician relationship. We analyze results using data from the primary care practice at the Mayo Clinic.
