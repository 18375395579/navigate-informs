Title: Fundamental Characteristics of Queues with Fluctuating Load<br>Author: Varun Gupta, Doctoral Student, Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, varun@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mor Harchol-Balter, Alan Scheller-Wolf, Uri Yechiali<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Systems with fluctuating arrival or service rates are very common, but are still not well understood analytically, even for an M/M/1 system. For example, does increasing the rate of fluctuation cause the mean response time to increase or decrease? Is it even monotonic? How do the performance experienced by users arriving into high load periods and low load periods compare? Are there stochastic relations between these? In this work, we provide the first answers to such fundamental questions.
