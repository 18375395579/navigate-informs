<br>Title: Effects of Missing Data in Competing Risks on Accelerated Life Testing</br><br>Author: Rong Pan, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States, rong.pan@asu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: It is important to consider the change in relative prevalence of the failure modes and the change in the dependence structure as the stress increases. The dependence structure of competing failure modes as their relative dominance change with the increase of the applied stress is studied in this research. Another objective of this research is to evaluate the impact of missing data at high stress levels during accelerated life testing on the extrapolation to normal working conditions.</br>
