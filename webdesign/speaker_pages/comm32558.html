Rardin, Hong Wan, Leyla Ozsen, Xiuli (Shelly) Qu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Open access scheduling has become a prevailing practice in outpatient clinics because it is believed to provide better access to care, better quality of care and ultimately optimize the use of urgent care and hospital resources. However, implementations have failed at many sites.  Therefore, we propose a configurable framework of rough cut tools for open access scheduling design which can make open access scheduling effective and adaptable to a variety of outpatient settings.
