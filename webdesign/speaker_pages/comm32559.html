Title: Predicting Manhole Events in New York City<br>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, rudin@mit.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: I will describe the Columbia/Con Edison Manhole Events Project, the goal of which is to predict electrical failures, namely manhole fires and explosions in New York City. I will discuss the data mining process by which we transformed extremely raw historical Con Edison data into a ranking model that predicts manhole vulnerability. Our ranked lists are currently assisting with the prioritization of future inspections and repairs in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx.
