<br>Title: Supply-function Equilibria with Mixed and Pure Strategies</br><br>Author: Andy Philpott, Professor, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, AK, 1025, New Zealand, a.philpott@auckland.ac.nz</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eddie Anderson, Par Holmberg</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Supply-function equilibria in pure strategies for uniform-price and pay-as-bid auctions have been well studied. We investigate settings in which these might fail to exist, and study the resulting mixed-strategy equilibria, with particular emphasis on situations in which the mixtures are over non-trivial supply functions.</br>
