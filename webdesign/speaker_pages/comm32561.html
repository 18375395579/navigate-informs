Title: Automatic, Near Real-time Event Detection in Twitter<br>Author: Jared Mowery, The MITRE Corporation, McLean, VA, United States of America, jmowery@mitre.org<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This project aims to explore the space of events that can be automatically detected in near real-time using Twitter data coupled with statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. The algorithms will be generalizable and semi-automated to enable rapid, cost-effective development of detectors in a variety of domains
