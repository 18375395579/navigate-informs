Title: Incorporating Price and Inventory Shocks in Earnings Forecasting for Retailers<br>Author: Saravanan Kesavan, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27516, United States of America, skesavan@unc.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Unexpected changes or shocks to inventory and margin serve as noisy signals of future performance for retailers. In this paper, I study if shocks to inventory and margin serve as a leading indicators of changes to future earnings. Also, I analyze the persistence of these shocks under different conditions to determine if it explains these unexpected changes in earnings. Finally, I investigate if equity analysts incorporate these information in their earnings forecasts.
