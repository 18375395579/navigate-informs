<br>Title: R&D Intensity and the NPD Portfolio</br><br>Author: Stylianos Kavadias, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 W. Peachtree St., NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, Stylianos.Kavadias@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Raul Chao</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A key metric for the assessment of innovative activity and organic growth is R&D intensity (the percentage of revenue that is reinvested in R&D). This research examines the link between R&D intensity, resource allocation, and the NPD portfolio. We find that lower R&D productivity, uncertainty, and cost of sales drive higher R&D intensity. Such metrics can help managers understand whether they are under or over investing in R&D given their particular industry and NPD portfolio characteristics</br>
