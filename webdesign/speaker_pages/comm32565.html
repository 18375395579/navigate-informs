Title: Does Pre-market Approval of Medical Devices Benefit Patients?<br>Author: Cheryl Druehl, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, United States of America, cdruehl@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhili Tian<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We examine whether the FDA Pre-Market Approval (PMA) and 510(K) processes benefit patients using two types of medical devices: spinal implants and stents. In PMA, applicants provide scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses. To quickly get to market, firms often go through 510(K) notification. Without scientific evidence, physicians may either ignore the innovative devices or adopt potentially unsafe devices. In either case, patients suffer.
