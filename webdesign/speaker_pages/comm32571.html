Title: Solution Approaches for the Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problem with Deadlines<br>Author: Barrett Thomas, Assistant Professor, Department of Management Sciences, University of Iowa, 108 John Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, barrett-thomas@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ann Campbell<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Time definite services are the fastest growing segment of the transportation industry.  Yet, little research has explored the impact these time constraints place on delivery problems.  This talk describes solution approaches to variants of the probabilistic traveling salesman problem that incorporate deadline constraints. The effects of using approximate cost and probability distributions in local search are discussed, and different neighborhood structures in local search are explored.
