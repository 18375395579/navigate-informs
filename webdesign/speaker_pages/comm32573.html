Title: Total Body Irradiation Treatment Planning Using IMRT Optimization<br>Author: Dionne Aleman, Assistant professor, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, aleman@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Sharpe<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Before bone marrow transplants, patients are treated with total body irradiation (TBI). Designing TBI treatments poses unique challenges that are not present in other forms of site-specific radiation therapy. In particular, the large distance from isocenter results in high uncertainty in the radiation dosage. We use intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with non-coplanar beam orientation optimization to deliver TBI treatments that place patients closer to isocenter, increasing accuracy.
