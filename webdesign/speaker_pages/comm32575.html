Title: Instant Message Dialogs Sent as Negotiated Interruptions for Updated Task Duration Estimates<br>Author: Franklin Dexter, Professor, University of Iowa, Anesthesia 6JCP, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, franklin-dexter@uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Operating room whiteboards (status displays) communicate times remaining in ongoing surgical cases to perioperative stakeholders (eg, post-anesthesia care unit, anesthesiologists, and control desks). We derived the conditional Bayesian lower prediction bound of a case’s duration, conditional on the minutes that the case has been ongoing. We implemented on the hospital's anesthesia information management system server database the automatic (every 5 min) update of times remaining for every case.
