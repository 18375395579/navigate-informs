Title: Pharmaceutical Pricing and Access to Innovation<br>Author: Stefanos Zenios, Professor, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, stefzen@exch-gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Cavallaro<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a discrete event simulation to examine the effect of reduced drug revenue on product development decisions.  Restricting reimbursement for pharmaceuticals led to superlinear decreases in both returns and product portfolio sizes while simultaneously increasing risk.   Extending the patent protection restored value lost to reduced reimbursement while simultaneously reducing risk.   This suggests that there exist an optimal policy system that can simultaneously reduce drug expenditures while maintaining current levels of shareholder value and access to capital.
