<br>Title: Dynamic Scheduling of Same-day Requests in Primary Care Practices</br><br>Author: Hari Balasubramanian, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 160 Governors Drive, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, hbalasubraman@ecs.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ana Muriel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Appointments in primary care are of two types: 1) prescheduled appointments, which are booked in advance of a given workday; and 2) same-day appointments, which are booked as calls come during the workday. The challenge for practices is to provide preferred time slots for prescheduled appointments and yet see as many same-day patients as possible during regular work hours. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program and develop guidelines for practices.</br>
