<br>Title: Rank versus Price Feedback in Open Auctions</br><br>Author: Wedad Elmaghraby, UMD, Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, United States, Wedad_Elmaghraby@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elena Katok</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Via interviews with auction practitioners, we learned that the use of rank feedback is increasing and now overshadows the use of full disclosure feedback. Practitioners have found that rank feedback stimulates more aggressive behavior from suppliers, particularly those that are in second or third place, since a supplier does not have to be the least cost supplier, but merely one of the least cost bidders. In this talk we report on experiments ran in the Netcentricity Behavioral Lab.</br>
