<br>Title: The Effect of Adherence and Toxicity on HIV Therapy Initiation</br><br>Author: Robert Koppenhaver, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, rzk9@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Roberts, Steven Shechter, R. Scott Braithwaite, Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) can extend the lifetime of an HIV patient, but at the cost of introducing a toxic element to the body. Further complicating this issue is that patients rarely adhere to HAART perfectly. Combining the effects of poor adherence and toxicity allows the body’s resistance to HAART to develop rapidly leading to poor patient outcomes. We use a discrete event simulation to examine how poor adherence and toxicity can lead to delaying the initiation of HAART.</br>
