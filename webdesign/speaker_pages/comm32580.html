<br>Title: On the Investigation of Economic Performance of the Partial Overlapping Batch-Means Control Charts</br><br>Author: Yi-chun Chen, National Tsing Hua University, 101, Section 2, Kuang-Fu Road, Hsinchu, Taiwan - ROC, d937817@oz.nthu.edu.tw</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wheyming Song</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Of the model-free SPC approaches for monitoring autocorrelated data, the unweighted batch-means control chart (UBM) is an effective one which groups the autocorrelated data into batch means, and then monitors the batch-means plotted on the control chart. In this research, we extend the idea of UBM to include the partial overlapping batch-means (PBM). We show empirically that the PBM performs as good as UBM for all cases studied and performs better than UBM for some cases.</br>
