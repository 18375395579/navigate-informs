A major part of their operations involves transporting patients between health facilities using a collection of fixed-wing aircraft stationed around the province. The requests are received a day in advance, and scheduled overnight. I will describe our work in using set partitioning to perform the scheduling, and its impact on Ornge's operations.</br>
