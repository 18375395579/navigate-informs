Title: Inference for Clinical Decision Making Policies<br>Author: Susan Murphy, Professor of Statistics, University of Michigan, 439 West Hall, 1085 S.

Thus it is crucial to provide measures of confidence concerning whether a particular patient variable is necessary.  We discuss a method for providing a measure of confidence and illustrate the method with STAR*D clinical trial data.
