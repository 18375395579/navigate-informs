Title: “Release Early, Release Often? An Empirical Analysis of Release Strategy in Open Source Software<br>Author: Wei Chen, University of California, San Diego, Rady School of Management, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92093, United States of America, wei.chen@rady.ucsd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vish Krishnan, Kevin Zhu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: “Release early, release often?has become a mantra in open source software (OSS). We study the impact of release strategies on the download performance of OSS projects. Using a panel data collected from Sourceforge.net, we find that release frequency has a curvilinear relationship with download performance. We also find that adoption cost and community contribution moderate the effect of release strategy. We explore the implications of our findings for the theory and practice of OSS management.
