Title: Strategic Planning of Forest Management and Industrial Capacity Needs Spatial Models<br>Author: Eldon Gunn, Professor, Dalhousie University, Dept.

These involve  biodiversity, ecodistricts,  watersheds, old growth and other protected areas.  They also involve transportation and relative location of mills to the forest harvest  and to each other. In this paper we report on large scale modelling approaches that can accommodate a diversity of spatial constraints and location decisions.  We report some numerical results.
