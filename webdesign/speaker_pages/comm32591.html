Title: Linking Customer Satisfaction with Future Willingness-to-pay<br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ramnath Vaidyanathan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study how the ex-post seat value perceived by a patron attending an event in a theater/stadium drives his/her future willingness to pay. Using a proprietary dataset collected by a professional franchise, we develop an empirical model quantifying the impact of increased satisfaction on a patron's future willingness to pay, controlling for customer attribute and seat location characteristics, to understand the linkage between a customer satisfaction metric and financial metrics.
