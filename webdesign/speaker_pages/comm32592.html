Despite inherent complexity, cellular networks across the organisms share functional modules with conserved interaction patterns, reminiscent of convergent evolution. Here we comparatively assay natural circuit modules for optimal control in cells, such as chemotaxis and circadian/cell cycle clocks, and discuss the implications on the reconstruction of synthetic circuits for engineering purposes.</br>
