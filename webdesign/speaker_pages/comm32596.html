<br>Title: Planning for Disruptions: Pre-positing of Supplies for Disasters</br><br>Author: Wilfredo Yushimito, Graduate Student, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 5308 Jonsson Engineering Center, Department of Civil and Env. Eng., Troy, NY, 12180, United States, yushiw@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Very little can be done after a disruption occurs, hence, it is important to account these possible events since the design phase. In this paper, we model the pre-positioning of supplies for disasters as a reliable facility location model identifying optimal locations for warehousing inventories for initial deployment of aid, trying to assure maximal and fair coverage and accounting for possible disruptions in the supply chain.</br>
