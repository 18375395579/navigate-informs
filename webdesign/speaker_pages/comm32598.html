Most hospital laboratories face the challenge to reduce cost and improve service quality. In our study, a Two-Stage Stochastic Programming Model was formulated to determine better phlebotomist schedules for the preanalytical stage of the testing process in hospital laboratories. The objective is to balance the workload among shifts and the workload among phlebotomists in each shift, which result in cost reductions.</br>
