<br>Title: Management Issues in Pricing and Revenue Optimization</br><br>Author: Brenda Barnes, President, Barnes Consulting Company, 140 E. 28th Street, Suite 10H, New York, NY, 10016, United States, brendaabarnes@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Pricing and revenue optimization systems can increase a firm’s profitability by 8 to 10 percent when properly implemented and managed. However, a company’s results will vary due to environment-specific factors impacting system performance, such as data integrity, analyst intervention, lack of coordination, and operational disruption. We draw on industry experience to identify factors impacting system effectiveness and actions management should take to achieve maximum financial benefits.</br>
