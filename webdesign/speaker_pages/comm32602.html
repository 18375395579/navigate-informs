<br>Title: Declaring a Decision - An Important Life Skill</br><br>Author: Steven Tani, Partner, Strategic Decisions Group, 735 Emerson Street, Palo Alto, CA, 94301, United States, stani@sdg.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A common source of poor decision-making among young people is the failure to think consciously about making a choice before taking action.  An important decision-making skill that we teach to young people is called Declaring a Decision. This skill includes taking personal responsibility for the choices that affect one's life and being alert to decision triggers that signal the need to stop and think about the choices rather than simply go with the flow.</br>
