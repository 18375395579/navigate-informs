IBM's BlueGene/L has a peak performance of 596 teraflops. A petaflop is 1000 times faster than a teraflop, and an exaflop is 1000 times faster than a petaflop.)  The raw processing power of computing has increased more than 1000 fold over the last 15 years and has been driven primarily by the market supporting the needs of individual users. The functions that these computers perform today are similar to that of 15 years ago (spreadsheets, word processors and displaying of web pages). Lately, fast search, social media and now analytics will drive computing again aimed at providing better overall user experiences to the individual user. While market forces over the last 15 years have been driving computing resources to make better user experiences at the level of the individual, the engineering, scientific and business communities have been exploiting and sometimes helping to guide the direction of the advances. If we use recent history as our guide, we would predict that future computers to be used for engineering, science and business need to also have much in common in systems designed to be used for the improvement of usability and function for the individual user. Exascale computing systems will be examined from this perspective. There are a number of commodity mass markets to choose components from when considering Exascale and these will be discussed with respect to their ability to address the challenges of processor performance, network capability, system energy efficiency, system reliability and most importantly the overall ability to extract results from an Exascale system. The question of whether we are now entering into a time when high performance computing can and must again sustain most of its ingredient components will therefore be addressed.</br>
