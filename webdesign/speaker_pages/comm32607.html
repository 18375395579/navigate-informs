Weblogs (or blogs) can be mined for valuable content leading to business intelligence, social phenomena analysis, and even counterterrorism activities.   We will examine both technical challenges in deriving useful content from weblogs as well as business interest in such technology.  Sample applications of sentiment or opinion analysis will be demonstrated.</br>
