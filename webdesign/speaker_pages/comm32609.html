Title: Online Consumer Search Depth: Theory and New Findings<br>Author: Jie Zhang, Jennifer.zhang@utoledo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Olivia Sheng, Xiao Fang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper extends the classic search model to analyze online consumer search behavior. The analytical results suggest that search depth is influenced by a variety of factors such as search cost, individual consumer difference, and product characteristics. Evidence is provided by clickstream data related to shopping music CDs, computer hardware and air tickets from July 2002 to December 2002.
