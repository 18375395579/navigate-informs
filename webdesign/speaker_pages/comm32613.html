Title: Designing Damage Functions for Military Applications<br>Author: Paul Goethals, Department of Mathematical Sciences, United States Military Academy, West Point, NY, United States of America, paul.goethals@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Griggs, Byung Rae Cho, Gregory Boylan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Over the last sixty years, a number of damage functions have been developed to appropriately model the effects of fragment dispersion.  These functions may take into account several factors such as weapon accuracy, human error, and meteorological conditions, when applied to a particular targeting scenario in the military.  This research examines the applicability of these functions and explores various alternatives by means of statistical modeling and optimization.
