Title: Multiple-objective Decision Model for Choosing Strategic Partners<br>Author: Don Buckshaw, Department of Defense, United States of America, dbuckshaw@hotmail.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Selecting a strategic partner can be a complicated process. There can be significant benefits to finding a long-term, capable partner, but there can be devastating results if the partnership leads to disclosure of sensitive information. The problem is to identify the best partner that maximizes benefit while minimizing the effects of misplaced trust. We developed a rigorous and repeatable process for evaluating partners using multiple-objective decision analysis and value-focused thinking.
