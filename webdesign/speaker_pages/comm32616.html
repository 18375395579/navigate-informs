<br>Title: Multiple-objective Decision Model for Choosing Strategic Partners</br><br>Author: Don Buckshaw, Department of Defense, United States of America, dbuckshaw@hotmail.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Selecting a strategic partner can be a complicated process.

The problem is to identify the best partner that maximizes benefit while minimizing the effects of misplaced trust. We developed a rigorous and repeatable process for evaluating partners using multiple-objective decision analysis and value-focused thinking.</br>
