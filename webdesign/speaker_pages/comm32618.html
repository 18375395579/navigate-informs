There are sectors “pushed?by technology or “pulled?by market. But what happens in the situations when technology and markets are unknown (ex., semiconductors). Which strategy to adopt in these conditions? We create a simulation model to test the influence of different sector dynamics on the choice of management strategies. Our results show new strategies that minimize risks and exploration costs in double unknown.</br>
