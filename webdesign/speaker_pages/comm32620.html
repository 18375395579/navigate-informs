Title: Multi-stage Integer Programs in Power Networks<br>Author: Daniel Bienstock, Columbia University, dano@ieor.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abhinav Verma<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present continuing work on various models for the dynamics of a blackout.  These models lead to difficult multi-stage mixed-integer programs.  In particular, we are interested in optimal 'attack' problems which server as a paradigm for exposing hidden weaknesses in a network.  Joint work with A. Verma.
