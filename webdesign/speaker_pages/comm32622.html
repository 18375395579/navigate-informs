Title: Metrics and Measures of Robustness in Airline Schedules<br>Author: Shervin AhmadBeygi, Ph.D Student, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, 48109, United States, shervin@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Belobaba, Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Airline plans that are efficient on paper are not always efficient in practice -- in fact, planned efficiency and operational robustness are often competing objectives. We discuss metrics and methods for addressing robustness in the airline planning process.
