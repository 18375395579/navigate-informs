Title: Methodological Issues for Hypergames<br>Author: Douglas Griffith, Cognitive Scientist, GDAIS, 1400 Key Boulevard, Arlington, VA, 22209, United States, douglas.griffith@gd-ais.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This presentation provides an overview of common human information processing biases that can adversely affect Hypergame inputs.  It provides methodologies for mitigating or eliminating these biases.  The techniques vary depending upon the time and resources available.  Even with simple techniques, Hypergames provide a useful analytic tool.  However, the quality of Hypegame outputs should vary as a function of the quality of the inputs.
