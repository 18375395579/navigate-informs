Title: Optimal Design of Social Comparisons in Service Cohorts: Setting Reference Points<br>Author: Guillaume Roels, UCLA, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States of America, guillaume.roels@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuanming Su<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we study social comparisons in groups such as customer cohorts in services. Social comparisons have been widely used as a behavioral incentive, e.g., to reduce energy consumption or improve worker productivity. Modeling social comparison as a game between players, we offer prescriptions as to how to set reference points and reference groups to induce desirable equilibrium outcomes.
