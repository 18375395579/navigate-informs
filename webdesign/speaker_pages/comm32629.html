Ángeles Moreno<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This work aims to study the participation of wind energy producers in the Spanish electricity market. Hence a tool which maximizes the incomes of wind power producers in electricity markets is employed. Through a stochastic process a strategic bidding algorithm is designed. It takes into account the variables involved in the process, namely wind power forecasts, market prices, as well as their forecasts. Moreover, a risk analysis is included in the results.
