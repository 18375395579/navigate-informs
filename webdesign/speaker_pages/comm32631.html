Title: Bayesian Evaluation and Selection Strategies in Portfolio Decision Analysis<br>Author: Eeva Vilkkumaa, Aalto University, P.O. Box 11100, Aalto, 00076, Finland, eeva.vilkkumaa@aalto.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Juuso Liesio, Ahti Salo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In project portfolio selection, the projects?future values are typically uncertain. We show how the Bayesian modeling of these uncertainties increases the expected value of the portfolio, raises the expected number of optimal projects in the portfolio and decreases post-decision disappointment. We also show that it pays off to re-evaluate only those projects that can be re-evaluated relatively accurately and that have particularly uncertain initial value estimates near the selection threshold.
