Title: Optimal Energy R&D Portfolio Investments Under Carbon Tax Uncertainty<br>Author: Ekundayo Shittu, Research Assistant, University of Massacusetts, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, eshittu@ecs.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erin Baker<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We explore the reaction of a firm's optimal investment in an energy R&D portfolio comprised of four different technologies to uncertainty in a future carbon tax. We find that investment allocation depends on the elasticity of substitution between carbon and non-carbon energy inputs as well as the relative costs of the technologies; and that overall investment decreases in risk.
