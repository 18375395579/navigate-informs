Therefore proper forecasting and pricing methods need to be developed for SME hotels. We use recent data of several Dutch SME hotels to explore the problems and opportunities for different types of hotels. Furthermore, different basic and advanced forecasting methods are applied to the data and the results are compared.</br>
