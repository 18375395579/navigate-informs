Title: Impact of Waiting Time on Patient Flow: An Econometric Analysis of Outpatient Clinics<br>Author: Diwas KC, Emory University, 1300 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, United States of America, diwas.kc@emory.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine patient throughput at an outpatient clinic. We develop a non-parametric model of patient choice and find that capacity affects throughput in two ways - by reducing the likelihood that the patient books an appointment, and by reducing the likelihood that a scheduled patient shows up for an appointment.
