Title: Decision Support Tool for Childhood Immunization Catch-up Scheduling<br>Author: Faram Engineer, Georgia Tech, School of Industrial and, Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, fenginee@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pinar Keskinocak, Larry Pickering<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We developed a decision support tool incorporating a dynamic programming algorithm to help providers and caretakers in constructing catch-up schedules for childhood immunization. These schedules ensure that a child continues to receive timely coverage against vaccine preventable diseases if one or more doses have been delayed. The tool is available for free download from the CDC website.
