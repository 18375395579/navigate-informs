Title: Greening Suppliers with Private Information<br>Author: Sang-Hyun Kim, Assistant Professor, Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT, 06511, United States of America, sang.kim@yale.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A successful sustainability initiative run by a manufacturer requires active participation by its suppliers. Given that such an initiative may force the suppliers to reveal their cost structure and other proprietary information, however, they may be unwilling to fully cooperate or try to free ride on other suppliers' efforts. We examine these incentive issues by building a model based on information disclosure literature.
