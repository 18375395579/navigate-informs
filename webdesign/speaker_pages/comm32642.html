Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, vaculin@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a framework for support of complex collaborative decision processes, such as team development project planning or acquisition, that integrates flexible declarative business process management techniques, human generated insights and analytics based insights.
