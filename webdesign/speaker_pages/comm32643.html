<br>Title: An Agent-based Dynamic Laboratory for Electricity Consumption Complex System</br><br>Author: Moeed Haghnevis, Graduate Research and Teaching Associate, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287-8809, United States of America, mhaghnev@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dieter Armbruster, Ronald Askin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The objective of this research is to construct an agent-based platform and toolkit that creates a dynamic laboratory to study properties and behavior of electric power grid supply and consumption networks and related engineered complex adaptive systems. In addition to developing an understanding of structural behavior, social networking interactions and consumer behaviors are integrated to manage demand in an environment with bi-directional information flow and variable supply.</br>
