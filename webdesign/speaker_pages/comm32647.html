<br>Title: How Exactly Does Value Creation Happen in Services? On the Way of Operationalizing SDL</br><br>Author: Christoph Heitz, Zurich University of Applied Sciences / Swiss Institute of Service Science, Postfach, Winterthur, 8401, Switzerland, heit@zhaw.ch</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Service Dominant Logic (SDL) has become an important paradigm for explaining value creation in services. While the theory seems to be valuable to analyze services, it is still in a very conceptual stage. When viewed with an operational perspective, many questions are not yet solved. In particular it is unclear how value is created over time which, in turn, is relevant for many important decision problems for both firms and clients. We present some thoughts on how SDL can be operationalized.</br>
