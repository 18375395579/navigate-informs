We develop a multicriteria decision-making supply chain network framework that captures the economic activities of manufacturing, storage, and distribution pre and post the integration. The models yield the system optima associated with the minimization of the total costs and the total emissions under firm-specific weights.  Numerical examples are also presented.</br>
