Title: Environmental and Cost Synergy in Supply Chain Network Integration<br>Author: Trisha Woolley, Doctoral Student, UMass Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, 121 Presidents Drive, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, twoolley@som.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anna Nagurney<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We quantify, from a supply chain network perspective, the environmental effects resulting when integration occurs.  We develop a multicriteria decision-making supply chain network framework that captures the economic activities of manufacturing, storage, and distribution pre and post the integration. The models yield the system optima associated with the minimization of the total costs and the total emissions under firm-specific weights.  Numerical examples are also presented.
