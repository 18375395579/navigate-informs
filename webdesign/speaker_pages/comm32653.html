<br>Title: Product Development Competitions as an Integrated Product Development Strategy</br><br>Author: Saurabh Bansal, Graduate Student Teaching Assistant, McCombs School of Business, University of Texas - Austin, 1 University Station B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, bansi@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Anderson</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a model that considers a two-pronged strategy for new product development (NPD) at a firm: 1) Product development through an in-house team, and 2) Product development through competitions.  The solutions received from the competition expedite the NPD learning process while the in-house team develops technical details to implement these solutions. Results indicate that competitions can expedite the NPD process when the technical knowledge about the new project is sparse in the firm.</br>
