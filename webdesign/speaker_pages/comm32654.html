Title: Bayesian Learning Real Options with Application to Aerospace Licenses<br>Author: Luke Miller, Professor, Saint Anselm College, 100 Saint Anselm Drive, Manchester, NH, 03102, United States of America, lukemiller@anselm.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of applying options pricing and Bayesian decision theory to value aerospace strategic licensing opportunities in the parts manufacturing approval (PMA) industry.  With a PMA industry valued at over $55 billion and encompassing over 245,000 parts across 2,000 PMA license holders, our main contribution was identifying that each license could be framed as a financial option and valued accordingly.
