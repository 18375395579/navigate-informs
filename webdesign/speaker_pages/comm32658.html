<br>Title: Responsibility of OR/MS for Disaster Management</br><br>Author: Martin Starr, Professor Emeritus, Crummer Graduate School of Business, Rollins College, 1000 Holt Avenue, Winter Park, FL, 32789, United States, mstarr@cfL.rr.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Disasters occur in three ways: first, by intentional malevolence; second, by human errors and technological failures; third, by acts of nature (e.g., hurricanes and tsunamis). Such regional disasters often trigger catastrophes such as dams breaking. This paper starts to examine how OR/MS models can begin to structure the three types of situations before they occur, during emergency periods, and after their occurrence. Emphasis is on the before scenarios.</br>
