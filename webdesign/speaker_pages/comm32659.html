Title: A Brief Biology Tutorial for Mathematical Programmers Interested in Systems Biology<br>Author: Kevin Livingstone, Assistant Professor, Trinity University, One Trinity Place, San Antonio, TX, 78212, United States, klivings@trinity.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Allen Holder, Eivind Almaas<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Systems biology a growing field ripe for collaborations between biologists and mathematical programmers. As in any interdisciplinary effort, one of the critical first steps is developing a common vocabulary between collaborators from different backgrounds. This presentation will provide a brief overview of the biology necessary to understand the questions posed in systems biology, including the central dogma of molecular biology, gene regulation, protein interaction, and metabolic networks.
