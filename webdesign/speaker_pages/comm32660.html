Title: Learning While Sourcing: Productivity Gains While Coordinating Software Development<br>Author: Paulo Gomes, Assistant Professor, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Campus de campolide, Lisbon, 1099-032, Portugal, pgomes@fe.unl.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Steve Rosenthal, Nitin Joglekar<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Organization theory makes a distinction between work conducted within an organization’s technical core and coordination processes that buffer this core from the environment. We build on this distinction to look for evidence of learning while sourcing. Learning is not observed in terms of total effort. Segregation yields significant effects: learning associated with the management of distributed software development is significant for coordination tasks and less pronounced for technical tasks.
