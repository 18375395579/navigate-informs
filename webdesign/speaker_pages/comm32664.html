Title: An Integrated-tool to Predict the Environmental Impact of Airport Deicing Operations<br>Author: Brian Huff, Associate Professor, The University of Texas at Arlington, Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019-0017, United States of America, bhuff@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Victoria C Chen, Hui-Chiao Jen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Strategies for integrating a number of statistical, analytical, and simulation-based modeling environments into an interactive decision support tool will be presented.  This talk will present a case study that required the development of a prototype decision support tool capable of mitigating the impact of airport deicing activities on the dissolved oxygen levels in adjacent waterways.
