One strategy that can be highly effective in reducing the incidence of surgical site infections is providing prophylactic antibiotics to patients prior to surgical incision. In this analysis we evaluate the effects of administering prophylactic antibiotics during different presurgical activities to determine a time that minimizes surgical site infections.
