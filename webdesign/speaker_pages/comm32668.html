Title: Strategies for Controlling Antiviral Resistance During the Next Influenza Pandemic<br>Author: Joesph Wu, The University of Hong Kong, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong - ROC, joewu@hku.hk<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many countries are stockpiling antivirals (primarily oseltamivir) to mitigate the impact of the next influenza pandemic. Such an unprecedented massive use of antiviral may cause rapid emergence of antiviral resistance, in which case the effectiveness of antiviral stockpiles will be substantially attenuated and billions of dollars invested in antivirals will be virtually wasted. We present strategies that may reduce this threat of antiviral resistance.
