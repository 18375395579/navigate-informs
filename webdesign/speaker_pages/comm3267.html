Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, 3000DR, Netherlands, cchen@rsm.nl</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Performance variations of chain members have a far-reaching consequence for the entire supply chain. However, performance risks have been a neglected topic in the literature. Existing studies mostly focus on market related risks and the risk of supply disruption. I develop a framework comprising Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and simulation techniques to analyze performance variations under two general problem scenarios; I also provide some potential applications of the framework to SCM.</br>
