Title: Assessing the U.S. Aviation Environmental Impacts Using a Duopoly Airlines Model<br>Author: Kushal A. Moolchandani, Purdue University, School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 701 W. Stadium Avenue, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, kmoolcha@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satadru Roy, Datu B. Agusdinata, Muharrem Mane, William Crossley, Daniel DeLaurentis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The operations of legacy and low-cost carriers in the U.S are simulated under various scenarios of economic conditions and policy implementations. The duopoly model is solved as a resource allocation set up to maximize airlines?profit while meeting market demand. This work also incorporates the ability to model airlines?decisions on retirement and acquisition of aircraft. This study helps assess the resulting emissions and noise impacts and could inform technological development and formulation of policies intended to reduce them.
