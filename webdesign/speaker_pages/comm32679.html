Title: Two-stage Group Screening for Detection of Interactions in Experiments<br>Author: Angela Dean, Professor, The Ohio State University, Department of Statistics, Cockins Hall, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, amd@stat.osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Susan Lewis<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A key tool for product improvement is the exploitation of interactions between control factors, which can be set in product specification, and noise factors, which cannot.  The strategy of two-stage group screening will be discussed, with the goal of identifying control-by-noise interactions with high probability. Web-based software will be described for elicitation of information from subject specialists.  Group screening methodology will be illustrated through an experiment run at Jaguar Cars.
