Title: Cluster Comparison Weights in ANP Models that are Dependent on the Alternatives<br>Author: Orrin Cooper, Assistant Professor, University of Memphis, Fogelman College of Business & Economics, Memphis, TN, United States of America, olcooper@memphis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guoqing Liu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The criteria weights or influence in an ANP model can be either independent of the alternatives like for school admissions or dependent on the alternatives like in a market share model.  When the criteria are dependent on the alternatives the cluster comparisons are also dependent on the alternatives and must be made individually for each alternative in order to avoid bogus results.  These results hold for both tangibles and intangibles. A simple example with the solution is presented herein.
