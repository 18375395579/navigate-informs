Heching, Marcelo Olivares</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a new dataset from a leading IT company that captures how agents spend their time and switch among tasks. We find that agent productivity is a time-dependent metric as opposed to be static and intrinsic to an agent. We thus propose the use of hazard rate to measure productivity and explore the driving factors that affect it, including interruptions, unfinished workload and cumulative workload during a shift. Our findings can help to develop more intelligent task routing scheme.</br>
