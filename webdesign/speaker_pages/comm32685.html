In this work, we develop a computational approach to find business partners based on firm profiles and transaction relationships among them. We applied machine learning techniques to model customer-supplier relationships. The results showed that our approach successfully found plausible suppliers, customers and outsources, and can support to develop one's own business in the complicated, specialized and rapidly changing business environments.
