Title: Cooperative Autonomous Unmanned Systems for Air, Sea, and Ground Operations in Urban Environments<br>Author: Jack Keane, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD, United States of America, jack.keane@jhuapl.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU/APL) has developed and demonstrated an innovative and scaleable autonomy and communications architecture for controlling swarms of heterogeneous, distributed vehicle systems, including UAV’s, USV’s, and UGV’s. This presentation will highlight the enhancements of JHU/APL’s mission-level autonomy over traditional unmanned vehicle control through a review of recently accomplished multi-UAV demonstrations.
