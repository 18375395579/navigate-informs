However, parallel computing, such as multi-core Desktops and many-core servers, is ubiquitous. What makes sequential procedures on multiple processors different from that on a single processor? is a critical question we intend to answer. We first identify the potential issues of simply executing existing procedures in parallel and then provide two approaches to address these problems.</br>
