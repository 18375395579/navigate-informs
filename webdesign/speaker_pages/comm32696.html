Specifically, Pyxis machines were tested in a pilot study to see if we could get the right products to the right place in a hospital setting at the right cost. Metrics will be described in the study before and after a pilot project. in addition, I will discuss some of the current issues, both managerial and technical, faced by the hospital.
