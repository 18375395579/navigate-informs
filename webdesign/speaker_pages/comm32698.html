Title: Hazards of Riding the Wave: Predictable Failure from Inverted Aspiration Divergence<br>Author: David Souder, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Road Unit 1041, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, DSouder@business.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Scott Johnson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The aspirations of external stakeholders normally impose constraints on managers, but if external stakeholders temporarily have higher aspirations than managers then managers may be inclined to exploit the situation.  Using data from IPOs of Internet-related companies before and during the 1999-2000 ‘bubble,?we find empirical support for the counterintuitive hypothesis that firms exploiting temporary access to resources may hasten a firm’s demise instead of prolonging its success.
