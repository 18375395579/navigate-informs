Title: Benefits of Cross-training in a Skill-based Routing Contact Center<br>Author: Baris Balcioglu, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto, baris@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mahvareh Ahghari<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study customer contact centers providing different types of services to impatient customers.  Our goal is to assess the performance improvement via cross-training the agents. We also compare the performance of the contact centers operating under different strategies. Our simulation study shows that limited cross-training, with 2 skills per agent, results in considerable performance improvements.
