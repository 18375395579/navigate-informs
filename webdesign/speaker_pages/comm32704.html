Title: Applying More Formalized Approaches to Drug Risk-benefit Assessments<br>Author: Theresa Mullin, Theresa.Mullin@fda.hhs.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: FDA risk-benefit assessment includes safety and effectiveness data for a specified drug, findings for other drugs for the same indication, and other factors, using quantitative analysis as well as subjective weighing of evidence.  Some have recommended FDA adopt formalized multi-attribute approaches; FDA is interested in exploring the potential applicability and limitations. This talk will describe candidate case studies where more formalized methods might be helpful and criteria for evaluation.
