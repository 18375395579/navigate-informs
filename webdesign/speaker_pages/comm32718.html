Title: Two-stage Stochastic Unit Commitment Models With Energy Storage and Demand Response<br>Author: Yuping Huang, Graduate Research Assistant, West Virginia University, 478 Harding Ave Apt 7, Morgantown, WV, 26505, United States of America, yhuang8@mix.wvu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Qipeng Zheng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Demand response is a key component of smart grid and energy storage is crucial for making variable renewable energy sources once they’re connected to power grid. This study is to develop two-stage stochastic programming models for unit commitment with energy storage, with demand response, and with both resources. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the effects of both resources on power generation.
