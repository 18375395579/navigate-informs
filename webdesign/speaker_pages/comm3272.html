Title: The Siren Call of Difficult Tasks: Some Experimental Findings<br>Author: Enno Siemsen, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 350 Wohlers Hall, 1206 S. Sixth Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States, siemsen@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elena Katok<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Theoretical research has established that autonomous agents can have a preference for difficult task solutions. Highly capable agents prefer somewhat more difficult solutions to simple solutions, in order to better establish their reputation. Less capable agents prefer highly difficult solutions to hide their lack of capability. We present results from a behavioral experiment testing this idea.
