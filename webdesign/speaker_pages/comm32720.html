Jacobson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Suicide bombers murdered hundreds of Israeli civilians during the past six years.  Israeli countertactics range from intelligence-driven arrests, to targeted killings of terror operatives (that have also led to civilian casualties), to last-minute interceptions. We develop a family of game theory models to examine suicide bombings and targeted killings in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and generate several results that aid in understanding the associated cycle of violence.
