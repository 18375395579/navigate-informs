Steinstr. 73, Halle, 06108, Germany, susanne.berger@wiwi.uni-halle.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Bierwirth</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Object of this talk is a decentralized planning approach for the coordination of independent transport service providers, where the individual routing and market-based coordination mechanisms are combined. The main goal is to discover the effects of this coordination for different scenarios (customer areas, routing problems), especially possible variation of the overall contribution margin for the whole network. The results should be compared with the results of the central planning approach.</br>
