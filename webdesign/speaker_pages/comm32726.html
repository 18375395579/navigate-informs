<br>Title: Spreadsheets & the B-school Bookshelf</br><br>Author: Patrick Noonan, Emory University, Goizueta Bus. School, 1300 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA, 30322, United States of America, patrick_noonan@bus.emory.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Spreadsheet skills occupy a challenging place in business schools. They are the standard analytical platform and support learning within and across courses. However, most administrators do not have the expertise to shape training and development of spreadsheet skills, and most faculty do not have the incentives or time. We propose two cross-cutting approaches to spreadsheet competency: aligning with the B-School canon, and with the natural phases of project-based problem solving.</br>
