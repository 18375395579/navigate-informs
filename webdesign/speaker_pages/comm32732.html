Title: Benefits Analysis of Improved Strategic and Operational Flight Predictability<br>Author: Kleoniki Vlachou, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn L. Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, kvlachou@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Lovell, Michael Ball<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Two different categories of benefits are quantified in this research based on improvements in two levels of flight predictability: Strategic flight predictability refers to the long term statistical characteristics of the timing of flight operations; and operational flight predictability refers to the statistical characteristics of the response time and information accuracy given to the flight operators on a daily basis.
