<br>Title: A Brief Survey of Some Applications in Computational Advertising</br><br>Author: Vanja Josifovski, Principal Research Scientist, Yahoo! Research, 2821 Mission College Blvd, Santa Clara, CA, 95054, United States of America, vanjaj@yahoo-inc.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We briefly describe four specific applications in computational advertising. We first present three problems in the domain of the Contextual Advertising where ads are placed on web pages. The challenges addressed here are how to select the features of the web pages and the ads that are used in the page-to-ad matching and how to produce a viable match scoring formulas. Next, we will overview an approach to ad selection in Sponsored Search based on query expansion using web results.</br>
