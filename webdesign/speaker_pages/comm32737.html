<br>Title: FlowBalancer Supports Strategic and Tactical Planning Problems by using Analytical Queueing Models</br><br>Author: Nico Vandaele, Professor, KU Leuven, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, 3000, Belgium, nico.vandaele@kuleuven.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kris Lieckens</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The design and planning of production systems at the strategic and tactical level is challenging because uncertainties make it difficult to set safety factors for three buffers: inventory, capacity and time. The FlowBalancer, developed within the SAS?environment, adds insights from flow dynamics into the S&OP process by using advanced queueing relationships. A differential evolution algorithm can find the best combination of three buffers that improves the operational and financial performance.</br>
