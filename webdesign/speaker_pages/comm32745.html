Title: Systematic Explanation of Differences across a Pair of Datasets<br>Author: Yuriy Sverchkov, Graduate Student Researcher, University of Pittsburgh, 200 Meyran Ave, Parkvale Building Suite M-183, #M-192, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States of America, yus24@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gregory Cooper<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We describe a method for obtaining a concise and mathematically grounded description of multivariate differences across a pair of datasets. Often data collected under similar circumstances reflect different patterns, e.g., patients undergoing similar treatments in distinct hospitals may experience different outcomes. We use a Bayesian network learned from the data to identify the subgroups of records that contribute to such observed differences, and qualify and quantify these contributions.
