<br>Title: From Vinyl to Chips: Capability Adaptation and New Products in Cultural Industries</br><br>Author: Bernardino Provera, Post-Doctoral Fellow, Bocconi University, Viale Isonzo 23, 20135, Milan, 20135, Italy, bernardino.provera@unibocconi.it</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gianmario Verona, Giuseppe Soda</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper investigates the process of incumbent adaptation to technological change in a mature industry. We focus on the music industry to analyze the transition from a traditional to a digital business model, investigating how incumbents responded to an externally-driven radical change by adapting their capabilities over time.  We adopt a mixed method approach exploring the role of human capital, social capital and cognition in defining response to a new technology.</br>
