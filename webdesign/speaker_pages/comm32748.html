We focus on the music industry to analyze the transition from a traditional to a digital business model, investigating how incumbents responded to an externally-driven radical change by adapting their capabilities over time.  We adopt a mixed method approach exploring the role of human capital, social capital and cognition in defining response to a new technology.
