<br>Title: Inland Troop Resupply Without a Road or Runway: Airdrop Solutions Including High-altitude Precision</br><br>Author: Derek Williamson, AF Insitute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way, Bldg 641, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, United States of America, derek.williamson@wpafb.af.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shane Hall, Brad Anderson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Given the variety of airdrop options available, it may be difficult to determine the least cost mix of paradrop and aircraft types to employ in a strategic military setting and how the chosen types affect delivery weight capacity while meeting specified sustainment goals subject to drop zone weight, altitude, offset, and accuracy requirements.  We present a methodology to analyze these decisions.  Several different scenarios are considered and practical insights are discussed.</br>
