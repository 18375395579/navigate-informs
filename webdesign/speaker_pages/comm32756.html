Title: Grid Integration and R&D policy<br>Author: Erin Baker, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, United States of America, edbaker@ecs.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Noubara Djimadoumbaye<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In previous work we have analyzed the optimal energy technology R&D portfolio in the face of climate change, considering solar PV, CCS, and nuclear. Here we consider how the results are impacted by two very different assumptions regarding the integration of solar PV onto the grid. We apply a mutli-model, decision making under uncertainty  framework.
