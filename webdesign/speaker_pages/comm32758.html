<br>Title: Geo-mapping:  Adherence Health Information Models and Management of Chronic Disease with GIS as an Individual and Community Concern</br><br>Author: Rashid Malik, GIS/Health Informatics/Database Manager, Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 201 W. Preston Street, Baltimore, MD, 21201, United States of America, rashid.malik@maryland.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): James C. Thomas</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) has built a robust GIS infrastructure to dynamically present an array of health information on the internet to Maryland communities.  Such presentation can be used to easily identify trends to reduce mortality and morbidity, improve access to care, and improve health outcomes.   Maryland DHMH’s adoption of geo-mapping has served as an effective gateway to increase agility and more accurate and complete health data has been made available to communities.  Geo-mapping has been effective in communicating essential public health information with communities at risk in simpler terms, which otherwise can be complex data to interpret and analyze.</br>
