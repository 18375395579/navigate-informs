Taxes, charges and cap-and-trade systems are discussed, especially the EU's Emission Trading Scheme and aviation within this scheme.   The EU-funded MIME project extends tradable permits to airport noise, defining such permits and making recommendations for legislation.  With Jet-A at US$1/litre, there is a search for new bio-fuels but kerosene is hard to replace. Could aviation's share of fossil CO2 rise to 100%?</br>
