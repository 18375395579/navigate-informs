Agents experience a loss if the resource is allocated in their proximity but not to them.  Resource and loss values are privately held by the agents. In a large network, a no-allocation equilibrium with revenues higher than that of any mechanism that always allocates the resource could emerge. We provide optimal direct mechanisms when the resource value is public, and describe the revenue-maximizing network structures.</br>
