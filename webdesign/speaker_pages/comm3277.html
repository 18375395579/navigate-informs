<br>Title: Learning to Detect Forest Fires</br><br>Author: Vladimir Ermakov, Scanex R&D Center, 51k3 Smolnaya St 153, Moscow, Russia, vermakov@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Georgy Potapov, Artur Dubrawski</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Large scale forest fires pose substantial challenges to safety, economy and societal stability. Satellite sensing is essential for their early detection and containment, and it has been used for over 10 years with significant efforts undertaken to improve its reliability. As new sensors come online a more scalable verification process becomes desirable. We propose to enable that by leveraging machine learning and by sourcing training data from volunteers via a purposively designed internet game.</br>
