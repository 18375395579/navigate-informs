EMIS, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States of America, aleskovs@lyle.smu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Barr</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Presented is a new category of network flow models: interval-flow generalized networks, an enhancement of linear generalized networks by conditional lower bounds on some or all of the arcs. Mathematical models, including fixed-charge formulations, and a variety of practical applications are described.</br>
