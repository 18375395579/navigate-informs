Title: Interval-flow Generalized Networks: Models and Applications<br>Author: Angelika Leskovskaya, Southern Methodist University, Dept. EMIS, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States of America, aleskovs@lyle.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Barr<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Presented is a new category of network flow models: interval-flow generalized networks, an enhancement of linear generalized networks by conditional lower bounds on some or all of the arcs. Mathematical models, including fixed-charge formulations, and a variety of practical applications are described.
