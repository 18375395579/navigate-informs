Title: A Stochastic Nonlinear Programming Model for Mammography Screening Policies Considering Adherence<br>Author: Mahboubeh Madadi, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, United States of America, mmadadi@email.uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ed Pohl, Shengfan Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Mammography screening policies have been the subject of significant debate in recent years. However, earlier studies on breast cancer screening policies did not take women’s adherence behaviors into consideration. In this study, a nonlinear integer programming model is developed to find the optimal screening mammography policies in terms of the likelihood of detecting breast cancer in its preclinical stage while incorporating variation in women’s compliance behaviors.
