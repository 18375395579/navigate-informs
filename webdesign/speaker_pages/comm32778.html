Title: Do Near Misses Impact Reference Points to Produce Risk Seeking Behavioral Responses to Warnings?<br>Author: Richard John, Associate Professor of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, richardj@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robin Dillon, Heather Rosoff<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We examine how framing of past experiences, in particular near-misses, alters decision makers' reference point. We report behavioral experiments comparing reference points before and after one or more near misses. Results suggest that decision makers are more risk seeking following a near-miss and the related shift in reference point.
