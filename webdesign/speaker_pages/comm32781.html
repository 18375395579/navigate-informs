<br>Title: Real-time Monitoring and Visualization of Truck GPS and Engine Data in the Toronto Area</br><br>Author: Matthew Roorda, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto, 35 St. George Street, Toronto, M5S 1A4, Canada, roordam@ecf.utoronto.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A “pseudo real-time?truck monitoring system is described, which is under development in Toronto, Canada.  The system makes use of route trackers, currently installed in over 10,000 trucks, that download data wirelessly to roadside receivers at freeway interchanges throughout Toronto. A variety of location, speed, and engine data are collected and visualized in a university based laboratory.  The project reflects a significant private sector / government / academia partnership.</br>
