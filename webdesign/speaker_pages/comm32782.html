<br>Title: Demand-supply Mismatches and Stock Market Reaction:  Evidence from Excess Inventory Announcements</br><br>Author: Vinod Singhal, Professor, College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, vinod.singhal@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Hendrick</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper documents that excess inventory announcements, an indication of demand-supply mismatch, are associated with an economically and statistically significant negative stock market reaction.  The results are based on a sample of 276 excess inventory announcements made during 1990-2002.  Over the day of the announcement and the day before the announcement the mean the stock market reaction ranges from -6.79% to -6.93%  depending on the benchmark used to estimate the market reaction.</br>
