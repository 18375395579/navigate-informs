<br>Title: Incentive-Based Ranking Mechanisms</br><br>Author: Rajat Bhattacharjee, MSandE, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States, rajatb@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ashish Goel</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider ranking/recommendation systems based on user feedback. We make a case for sharing with users the revenue generated by such systems. Our main contribution is a mechanism which rewards useful feedback and is resistant to selfish/malicious behavior (eg. click spam). The mechanisms are designed to reward discovery of high quality entities. Misclassified pages represent an arbitrage opportunity for the discerning user. The mechanisms are simple enough for use with existing technology.</br>
