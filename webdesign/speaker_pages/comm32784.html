We investigated how bidders choose their bids when multiple identical auctions are running concurrently. We identified factors affecting bidders?decisions on which auction to bid. We also revealed how single-unit demand bidder’s bidding behavior differs from multi-unit demand bidder’s. We develop an empirical model to estimate those issues using the overlapping online auction data.
