To get the most from this session participants should read the case (available for download from Ivey Publishing, http://cases.ivey.uwo.ca/cases/pages/home.aspx, case # 9B00E013) and answer these questions: 1. Critique Hamilton’s model; 2. Develop an alternate model; and 3. How should Lansink respond?  We will end with a discussion of the case and case teaching.
