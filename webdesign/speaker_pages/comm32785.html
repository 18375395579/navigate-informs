<br>Title: Teaching with Cases</br><br>Author: Greg Zaric, Associate Professor, Ivey School of Business, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, gzaric@ivey.uwo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Srini Krishnamoorthy</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We will teach the case “Lansink Appraisals?in more or less the same way that we would to MBA and undergraduate business students.  To get the most from this session participants should read the case (available for download from Ivey Publishing, http://cases.ivey.uwo.ca/cases/pages/home.aspx, case # 9B00E013) and answer these questions: 1. Critique Hamilton’s model; 2. Develop an alternate model; and 3. How should Lansink respond?  We will end with a discussion of the case and case teaching.</br>
