Conejo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A wind power producer participating in a pool-based electricity market should derive its bidding strategies for the day-ahead market as well as for other shorter-term adjustment and balancing markets. This paper provides a multi-stage stochastic programming methodology to derive optimal bidding strategies for such markets. Appropriate examples and case studies are analyzed. Adequate conclusions are provided.
