We study whether the subjects tended to change their anchor based on the experimental setting. A secondary objective was to study the impact of group dynamics. We observed that (i) the subjects did not anchor on any particular value, but chose an anchor that was closer to the optimal decision; and (ii) the groups demonstrated a lower tendency to anchor.</br>
