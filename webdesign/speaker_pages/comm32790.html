Title: Risk Metrics in Supply Chain Management<br>Author: John Birge, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, John.Birge@ChicagoGSB.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A variety of measures have been proposed for including risk considerations into operational contexts. Each of these measures has merit in different contexts, but care is necessary to ensure that the proposed models are consistent with other principles.  This talk will discuss features of various risk measures, their motivation and uses, and how to ensure consistency with basic economic assumptions.
