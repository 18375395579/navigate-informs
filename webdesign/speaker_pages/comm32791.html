<br>Title: Joining the CCS Club!  Insights from a Northwest European  CO2 Pipeline Project</br><br>Author: Stephane Tchung-Ming, Research Fellow, IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1 ?4 Avenue de Bois Préau, Rueil-Malmaison, 92852, France, stephane.tchung-ming@ifpen.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Olivier Massol</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The large-scale diffusion of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies imposes the construction of a sizeable pipeline infrastructure. We analyze the conditions for a widespread adoption of CCS by a group of emitters using a common pipeline system. It clarifies how the regulatory constraints imposed to the pipeline operator influence the emitters' adoption. An application of this framework to the case of a European point-to-point pipeline is discussed. Policy recommendations are formulated.</br>
