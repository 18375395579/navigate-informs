Title: Would the Social Planner Let Bags Fly Free?<br>Author: Gad Allon, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL, United States of America, g-allon@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Achal Bassamboo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In June 2008, American Airlines became the first major US airline to institute a fee on the first checked bag. Within 18 months, nearly every other major carrier followed suit. Here, we examine whether the fees are socially efficient. We find that the fees are in fact Pareto improving. While customers may dislike the fees, they are a means to alter customer behavior and thus reduce the airline's costs. Customers are compensated by lower base fares.
