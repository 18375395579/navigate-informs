<br>Title: Abduction, Perceptions, Thin Slices, and Intuition</br><br>Author: Michael Cassidy, Professor, Marymount University, 2807 North Glebe Road, Arlington, VA, 22207, United States of America, mcassidy@marymount.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The purpose of this session is to explore these commonalities, as conceptualized by thinkers often unaware of parallel inquiry and investigation. In particular, the session will include consideration of  Peirce’s concept of abduction; the Lens Model, as developed by Brunsik and his heirs; bounded rationality, explored by Simon; heuristics, as characterized by Kahneman and Tversky, and others in that research tradition;  and the concept of thin slices, as investigated by Ambady and her colleagues. Exploring the similarities among these largely insular traditions will contribute to enriched understanding across disciplines, and result in a more robust and nuanced interpretation of a topic with significant practical implications.              Session one, led by John Rohrbaugh, will focus on both Brunsik’s Lens Model and Policy Capture, with particular attention to decisions addressed in multi-person situations. Stephen Weinberg will consider the topic from the vantage of Herbert Simon’s notion of bounded rationality. The concluding session, led by Michael Cassidy, will draw on Rohrbaugh’s and Weinberg’s presentations, and attempt a systematic comparison of these and other vantages. To integrate the three presentations, each author will draw on a fictitious law-enforcement example involving human deception to illustrate salient principles and concepts.</br>
