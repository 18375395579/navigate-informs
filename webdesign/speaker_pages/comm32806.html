Title: Multivariate Distributions Induced by Dynamic Environments<br>Author: Refik Soyer, Professor of Decision Sciences, The George Washington University, 2201 G Street, Washington, DC, United States of America, soyer@gwu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider multivariate distributions that arise as a results of components sharing a common operating environment. The operating environment follows a discrete time stochastic process and modulates failure characteristics of individual components. We discuss characteristics of the resulting multivariate models and develop Bayesian inference for their analysis.
