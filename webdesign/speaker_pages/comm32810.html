We address these questions by examining the impact of a firm’s strategic conformity on the flow of resources into the firm using a sample of 150 biotech firms that issued an IPO between 1982 to 2001. Using IPO performance as a measure of constituent-based legitimacy, we find that firms who conform to specific strategies are rewarded but we also find areas in which firms are penalized for conformance.</br>
