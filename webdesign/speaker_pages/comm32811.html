Title: A Template for Planning and Optimizing Small Package Loads<br>Author: Keith Ware, OR Manager, UPS, 1400 N. Hurstbourne Pkwy, Louisville, KY, United States, kware@ups.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Youngblood, Jim Murphy, Doug Mohr<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: UPS hub managers make weekly and daily adjustments to their sort load plans in order to adapt to different volume levels and/or planned changes in truck traffic.  The load planning template is a spreadsheet based tool that gathers all the pertinent planning information, and enables a load planner to make and visualize the impact of  changes to the plan.  The tool also serves as a quasi-interface for an optimization model for developing a plan that minimizes handling and transportation costs.
