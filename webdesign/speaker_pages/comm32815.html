Title: Piecewise Linear Approximation for Network RM<br>Author: Sumit Kunnumkal, Indian School of Business, AC4 Level 1 4116, ISB, Hyderabad, AP, India, Sumit_Kunnumkal@isb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kalyan Talluri<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate the piecewise-linear approximation for network RM with and without choice behavior.  We show that it is tractable, and can be solved efficiently in many applications of practical interest.
