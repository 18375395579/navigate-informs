<br>Title: Piecewise Linear Approximation for Network RM</br><br>Author: Sumit Kunnumkal, Indian School of Business, AC4 Level 1 4116, ISB, Hyderabad, AP, India, Sumit_Kunnumkal@isb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kalyan Talluri</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the piecewise-linear approximation for network RM with and without choice behavior.  We show that it is tractable, and can be solved efficiently in many applications of practical interest.</br>
