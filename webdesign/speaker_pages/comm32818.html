Swaminathan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper we use micro-level data on store traffic, sales and labor from 41 stores of a large retail chain to identify the extent of understaffing in retail stores and quantify its impact on sales and profitability using structural estimation.  Aligning staffing levels with changing traffic patterns can result in a 6.15% savings in lost sales and a 5.74% improvement in profitability.
