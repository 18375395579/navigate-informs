<br>Title: Reducing Wait Times & Improving Resource Utilization at the BC Cancer Agency’s Ambulatory Care Unit</br><br>Author: Pablo Santibanez, Operations Research Scientist, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 600 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 4E6, Canada, psantibanez@bccancer.bc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vincent Chow, John French, Martin Puterman, Scott Tyldesley</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We report results of a study of the British Columbia Cancer Agency’s Ambulatory Care Unit. We developed a simulation model of the process and showed that improved patient scheduling and operational changes would reduce patient wait times and use resources more efficiently. Short-term recommendations are currently being implemented and long-term recommendations will drive a major physical renovation.</br>
