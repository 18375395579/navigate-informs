<br>Title: New Service Development through Lead-Users: An Empirical Investigation</br><br>Author: Rosa Eterno, Research Assistant, Catholic University of Portugal, School of Economics and Management, Lisbon, PT, Portugal, rpe@fcee.ucp.pt</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pedro Oliveira, Ana Póvoa</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: There is increasing evidence that most new products are developed by users, who then to give ideas to manufacturers. Despite the importance of services, scarce attention has been paid to the study of service innovation through lead-users. This research attempts to fill that gap. We empirically investigate (using data from a large Portuguese service company) the extent to which users can be sources of ideas for new services, the antecedents that influence innovation and the implications of such practices for the company.</br>
