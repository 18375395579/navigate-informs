Title: Autonomous Agent-based Decision-making for the Smart Electricity Grid<br>Author: Markus Peters, PhD Candidate, Erasmus University, Rotterdam School of Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands, m@rkuspeters.de<br>Coauthor(s): Wolf Ketter, Maytal Saar-Tsechansky, John Collins<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The vision of a Smart Electricity Grid requires substantial advances in intelligent decentralized control mechanisms. We study a novel class of autonomous brokers that derive profit-maximizing strategies from interaction with their environment and demonstrate their performance in experiments with real-world data. Our work lays the foundation for innovative intermediation services that enable customer participation in the Smart Grid, and enhance the economic sustainability of power systems.
