Title: Evacuation Planning Based on Lane Reversal and Crossing Elimination<br>Author: Mark Turnquist, Cornell University, mat14@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chi Xie<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe a bi-level program for network evacuation that includes both lane reversal and elimination of traffic stream crossings at intersections. Traffic assignment is done using stochastic user equilibrium on the congested network. Provision for inbound access by emergency vehicles is also included.  Solutions are illustrated for a case study in an area surrounding a nuclear power plant.
