<br>Title: Treasure Hunt: Social Learning in Real-World Social Networks</br><br>Author: Markus Mobius, Associate Professor of Economics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, mobius@fas.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tuan Phan, Maya Eden</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We design a simple experiment to measure the spread of information in a real-world social network. We carefully document subjects' evolving beliefs and whom they talk to. We analyze the resulting data using a simple model which allows us to estimate (1) how far information travels, and (2) how subjects weigh information from different regions of the social network.</br>
