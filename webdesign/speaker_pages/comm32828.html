We introduce the store liquidation problem, discuss its importance to retailers, and give a technique for optimizing key liquidation decisions: markdowns, inventory, and store closings. Through applications, we show that this method improves liquidation outcomes substantially. We identify ways in which current practice differs from the optimal decisions and trace the consequences of these differences.</br>
