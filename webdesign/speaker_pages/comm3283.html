Title: Population-Level Learning: Industry-Level Variability of Learning Outcomes from Innovations<br>Author: Andreas Schwab, Associate Professor, Iowa State University, 3315 Gerdin, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, aschwab@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay O'Toole, Anne Miner<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study investigates industry-level variability in learning outcomes following the implementation of an innovation. We challenge the intuition that early periods are marked by more variation than later periods. Contingency factors that shape variability include varied imitation rules, deliberate innovation, and interactions across innovation features and levels of learning. We test hypotheses using historic data on the farm-system, an administrative innovation in baseball industry.
