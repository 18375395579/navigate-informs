Title: Space Optimization at Target<br>Author: Lisa Miller, Target Corp., 33 South Sixth Street, CC-2220, Minneapolis, MN, 55402, United States of America, LisaA.Miller@target.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: With over 1,500 stores of varying shapes and sizes in diverse markets, Target faces a constant challenge to put the right products in the right stores in the right quantities. Additionally, the placement of items within the stores must be done in a way  that is easy for guests to shop. In this talk, I will discuss current efforts to use optimization to determine how to place products on shelves while considering product restrictions,  presentation strategies, and inventory goals.
