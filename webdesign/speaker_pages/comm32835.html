In high-tech, products introduced within 18 months often contribute over 50 percent of revenue.  While mispricing at introduction can have a devastating impact on margin, these pricing decisions are often the most uncertain due to lack of data.  This session introduces a framework to improve NPI decisions by providing a typology of NPI decisions each calling for a different pricing strategy and analytical technique.
