Title: A Review of the Literature on the Concept of Value of Information<br>Author: Lea Deleris, Postdoctoral Researcher, Stanford University, Math Sciences Department, IBM TJ Watson Research Center, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, ldeleris@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The concept of value of information is central to the field of decision analysis: it enables to put bounds on the price to pay for information and can identify decision situations where information is useless. In an age where information is increasingly accessible but often costly, the concept of value of information represents a powerful while simple idea. In this talk, I review the decision analysis literature on the concept of value of information and identify related research directions.
