Title: Recent Results and Unsolved Problems in Computational Biology<br>Author: James Orlin, Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Operations Research Center, E53-363, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, jorlin@MIT.EDU<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Computational biology is a field that is rich in analytical problems of great significance.  Great strides have been made over the past 15 years including a sequencing of the human genome and other genomes.  All of this data provides opportunities for addressing fundamental problems. This talk, which will be based on interviews with those in computational biology, will be a description of some of the key problems in the field as well as descriptions of some recent successes.
