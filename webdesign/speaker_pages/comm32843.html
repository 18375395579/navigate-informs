For example, in academic literature a leading service perspective has been intangibility, which has recently been empirically shown to be inaccurate and misleading. We will discuss other common perspectives on services including product as a process, customer as co-producer, the rental/access paradigm, and others. Some are upheld as empirically valid and useful, yet others are shown to be dangerous misconceptions.</br>
