<br>Title: A Model of Dynamic Pricing with Strategic Customers and An Information Provider</br><br>Author: Song (Alex) Yang, PhD Student, The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, syang1@chicagogsb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Birge</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Dynamic pricing problems with strategic customer behavior have drawn increasing attentions from academia, among which many focus on equilibrium results in the dynamic game between the seller and customers with symmetric information. However, in reality, asymmetric information is a more valid assumption. In this talk, we propose a dynamic pricing problem assuming customers have limited information from an information provider. Both theoretical and numerical results will be shown.</br>
