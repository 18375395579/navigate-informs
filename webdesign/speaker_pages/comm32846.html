Those risks are impossible to trade and markets alone might not be sufficient to deliver the appropriate investment.  To restore the investment signal, forward contracts and reliability options were proposed in the literature.  We elaborate on the issue using a stochastic-endogeneous equilibrium model and analyze how the mechanisms help to complete the market in terms of welfare and investment.</br>
