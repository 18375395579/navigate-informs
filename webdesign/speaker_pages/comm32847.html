Title: Departure Flow Management Concept and Algorithms Overview<br>Author: Jason Pepper, Senior Software Engineer, Metron Aviation, Inc., 131 Elden St, Suite 200, Herndon, VA, 20170, United States of America, pepper@metronaviation.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Carniol<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Departure Flow Management (DFM) system automates the coordination of departures from multiple airports into shared and congested National Airspace System (NAS) resources via improved decision support capabilities and web-based communications.  DFM increases situational awareness and moves decision making away from a centralized authority, to parties with more need for control. This presentation will compare current operations to the operations under DFM, and will discuss the DFM algorithms.
