Title: Designing an Effective Mass Prophylaxis Response System<br>Author: Cindie Wu, Cornell University, c/o Professor Jack Muckstadt, 286 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, cindiewu@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Caitlin Hawkins<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Prophylaxing a population within 48 hours of infection is key to ensuring survival during an outbreak of smallpox, anthrax, or influenza. To prophylaxis a large population quickly, moving people to a point of dispensing (PoD) and serving them efficiently within a PoD is imperative. We present an analytic and simulation PoD model that will assist public health officials in determining staffing and service levels throughout a prophylaxis campaign for a system of PoDs.
