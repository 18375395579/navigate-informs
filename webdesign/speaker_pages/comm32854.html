Title: Venturing with Novel Ideas: Using the Transformation Heuristic to Learn Not to Fall<br>Author: Tony Briggs, Boston University School of Management, 595 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA, 02215, United States, tbriggs@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Carlile<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: How do entrepreneurs make investment decisions within minutes of hearing of a novel idea? We find that high performing entrepreneurs: (1) share a high volume of ideas, (2) fail ideas from very limited criteria, and (3) quickly fail most ideas without significant investments in information gathering. They select ideas which, independent of their evaluative criteria, share a particular aesthetic for transformation. We describe the use of this aesthetic as the transformation heuristic.
