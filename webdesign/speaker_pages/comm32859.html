Title: Combinatorial Auctions<br>Author: Sasa Pekec, Duke University - The Fuqua School of Business, 1 Towerview Road, Durham, NC, 27708-0120, United States of America, pekec@duke.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Combinatorial auctions have been in focus of interdisciplinary research efforts combining economics, computer science and OR. Mike Rothkopf’s ideas and research played a pioneering role in defining the area, making it interdisciplinary, and shaping research directions. In this talk I will review Mike’s contributions and their impact on our current understanding of combinatorial auctions, as well as some of Mike’s ideas that still seem to be ahead of currently fashionable research topics.
