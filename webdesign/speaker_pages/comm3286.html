Results have emerged for a variety of models, and the general message is that economic models tend to be computationally hard in the worst case.  This motivates the question of whether this complexity has empirical implications.  In this work, we begin to address this question in the context of consumer choice theory and bimatrix games using tools from revealed preference theory.
