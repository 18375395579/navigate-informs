Title: Capacity Guarantees as a Mechanism for Smart-grid Evolution<br>Author: Xiaoyue Jiang, Tulane University, 7 McAlister Drive, New Orleans, LA, 70118, United States of America, xjiang@tulane.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Burcu Tan, Geoffrey Parker, Anjali Sheffrin, Ekundayo Shittu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We believe the economic framework of capacity guarantees together with new methodologies to evaluate capacity can play a vital role in delivering on the promise of smart grids. We show how these new tools can coordinate multiple technologies including renewables, storage integration, and demand response, to reshape the electricity and capacity market structure, and to create market incentives to evolve the power system in a more reliable, efficient and sustainable direction.
