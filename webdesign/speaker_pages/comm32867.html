We test this framework using evidence from 200 clean energy firms. Results indicate that slack ?a measure of liquidity that can create ex-post options - is significantly associated with value. Other flexibility constructs, such as operational responsiveness and R&D investment are selectively associated with value depending on whether a firm is in the mature or in the growth phase of its lifecycle.</br>
