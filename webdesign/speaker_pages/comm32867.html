Title: Market Value of Flexibility: Evidence from the Clean Energy Industry<br>Author: Jane Davies, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States of America, jdavies@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nitin Joglekar<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a framework that links market value of firms with a variety of flexibility measures. We test this framework using evidence from 200 clean energy firms. Results indicate that slack ?a measure of liquidity that can create ex-post options - is significantly associated with value. Other flexibility constructs, such as operational responsiveness and R&D investment are selectively associated with value depending on whether a firm is in the mature or in the growth phase of its lifecycle.
