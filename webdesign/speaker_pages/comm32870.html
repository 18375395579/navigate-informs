Title: Workforce Planning Models with Individual Worker Differences<br>Author: Esma Gel, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287-5906, United States, esma.gel@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pornsarun Wirojanagud, John Fowler<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss formulations and efficient solution methods for workforce planning. In particular, we consider individual worker differences and a variety of decisions such as hiring, firing, cross-training and the use of contingent workers. Our results demonstrate the importance of modeling worker differences as well as the effectiveness of our heuristics.
