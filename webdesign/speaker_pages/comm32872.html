Here we try to Learn from the smokestacks - from the well developed Models and Processes of Manufacturing. In particular, we find that the IHIP characteristics of Services make them similar to manufacturing models where the decoupling point is away from the customer processes, e.g. in Make-To-Order. We adapt and extend the relevant methods of these models to 3PL services, especially to shipping.
