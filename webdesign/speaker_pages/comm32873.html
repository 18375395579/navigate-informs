Title: Air Transport in its Energy-economy-environment Context<br>Author: Thomas Fiddaman, Ventana Systems, 1070 Bridger Woods Rd, Bozeman, MT, 59715, United States of America, tom@ventanasystems.com<br>Coauthor(s): Dan Goldner<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Air transport is a component of a global system involving demographic, macroeconomic, technical and environmental dynamics. We consider some of the key feedbacks influencing future aviation, including its dependence on and contribution to economic growth, greenhouse gas accumulations and the possible evolution of climate policy, and liquid fuel scarcity. We illustrate ramifications for the industry using simulations of US airspace strategy and a simple global climate integrated assessment model.
