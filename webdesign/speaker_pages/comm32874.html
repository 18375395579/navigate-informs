Title: The Coordination of Pricing and Production Decisions<br>Author: Nicholas G. Hall, Professor, Ohio State University, Fisher College of Business, 2100 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210-1144, United States, hall_33@cob.osu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We review the literature on deterministic models for the coordination of pricing and production decisions. We present recent research results on the coordination of pricing and job-by-job scheduling decisions. We also discuss a competitive, multiple player environment where available capacity is auctioned and resulting schedules are thus determined. Promising directions for future research are identified.
