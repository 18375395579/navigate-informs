Here I describe similarity metrics for graphs that contain a heterogeneous mixture of textual and non-textual objects.  These similarity queries can be easily formulated by a naive user, and subclasses of these queries can be used to solve several interesting problems, such finding the referents for entity names in context. Tuning similarity search with learning leads to excellent performance on many problems.</br>
