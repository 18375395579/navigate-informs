Title: Using Revealed Preference for Portfolio Management<br>Author: Richard Tepel, Lead Operations Research Analyst, MITRE Economic and Decision Analysis Center, FOB2 Navy Annex, Arlington, VA, United States of America, rtepel@mitre.org<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Once investments are actually selected we may know their relative priority compared to other potential investments and their funding levels. But, can the actual priority of investments and the levels of investment reveal the preferences embedded in the value structure? The paper explores ways to determine which values of the parameters in the value structure would be needed to generate the actual funded investment structure.
