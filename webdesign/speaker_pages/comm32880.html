C. Resende<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a new implementation of a widely used swap-based local  search procedure for the P-median problem, proposed in 1968 by Teitz and  Bart. It produces the same output as the best alternatives described in  the literature and, even though its worst-case complexity is similar,  it can be significantly faster in practice: speedups of up to 3 orders  of magnitude were observed.  We also show that our method can be easily  adapted to implement path-relinking and tabu search.
