<br>Title: Enabling Greater Access to Home Meal Delivery</br><br>Author: Maciek Nowak, Associate Professor, Loyola University Chicago, 1 E. Pearson, Chicago, IL, 60611, United States of America, mnowak4@luc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mike Hewitt, Leonardo Gala</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Meals on Wheels relies on a volunteer workforce to deliver meals to approximately one million homebound citizens in the US. One strategy for accommodating these requests is to deliver multiple (frozen) meals at a time. However, the funding agencies and the volunteers value the relationships that are developed by having a client interact with the same volunteer. We present an approach to quantify the efficiencies associated with delivering frozen meals while maintaining volunteer consistency.</br>
