If the duration of an activity is a random variable then the cost associated with that activity is also a r.v. and thus the range of cost outcomes at any give time can be bordered by an upper and lower bound.  This range forms an “alphorn?getting wider as the duration of the project increases.  Further, we investigate the complexity of calculating the Alphorn of Uncertainty exactly.
