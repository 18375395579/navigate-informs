<br>Title: Beyond Staffing Numbers: The Effect of Skill-mix, Cohesion and Leadership on Adverse Events</br><br>Author: Stefan Scholtes, Professor, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, United Kingdom, s.scholtes@jbs.cam.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sandra Sülz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Despite considerable research efforts, managerial recommendations concerning the link between hospital nurse staffing and patient outcomes remain inconclusive. While most research has focused on numbers of staff, we argue that team variables, such as skill-mix, cohesion and leadership, are just as relevant for the prevention of adverse events in hospitals. Our empirical study is based on three years of patient-level and employee-level data of a neuroscience division in a large general hospital.</br>
