Title: Identifying Readmission-related Clinical Associations via a Novel Tree-embedded Graphical Model<br>Author: Yazhuo Liu, University of South Florida, 14249 Les Palms Cir, Tampa, FL, 33613, United States of America, yazhuoliu@mail.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shuai Huang, Jose Luis Zayas-Castro, Peter Fabri<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Failing to uncover clinical associations may hinder clinicians detecting important disease symptoms, which may lead to inadequate health care. Challenges of identifying those unknown clinical associations from the ICD-9 codes include the high-dimensionality of the ICD-9 codes and nonlinear interactions among them. We propose a novel tree-embedded graphical model to address these challenges.
