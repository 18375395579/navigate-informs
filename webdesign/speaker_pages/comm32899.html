We assess how uncertainty in future vehicle technology costs and developments in other energy sectors affect cost-effective fuel and vehicle technology choices in a future carbon constrained world. We conclude that a portfolio approach of multiple fuel and vehicle technology pathways is ideal for achieving affordable and sustainable personal mobility.</br>
