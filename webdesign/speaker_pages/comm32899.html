Title: Global Energy Transition (GET) Model:  Informing Vehicle Technologies in a Decarbonized Economy<br>Author: Maria Grahn, Chalmers University of Technology, Dept of Energy and Environment, Physical Resource Theory, Gothenburg, 41296, Sweden, maria.grahn@chalmers.se<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy J Wallington, Erica Klampfl, Margaret Strumolo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The GET model is an LP that generates the fuel and technology mix that meets global energy demands at lowest energy system costs. We assess how uncertainty in future vehicle technology costs and developments in other energy sectors affect cost-effective fuel and vehicle technology choices in a future carbon constrained world. We conclude that a portfolio approach of multiple fuel and vehicle technology pathways is ideal for achieving affordable and sustainable personal mobility.
