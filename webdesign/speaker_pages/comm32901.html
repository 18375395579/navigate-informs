Title: Group Abduction:  Assessing the Performance of Expert Teams<br>Author: John Rohrbaugh, Professor, University at Albany, State University of New York, 1400 Washington Ave., Albany, NY, 12222, United States of America, jrohrbaugh@albany.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Nearly 100 years have passed since the death of Charles Sanders Peirce, an American philosopher who introduced the concept of abduction as an alternative to both deductive and inductive forms of reasoning. Whereas deduction invokes the certainty of premises to establish the certainty of conclusions and whereas induction requires that all assertions be accompanied with an explicit acknowledgement of the risk of error, Peirce characterized abductive reasoning as the process of making guesses largely unguided by the rules of logic or statistics. Later in the 20th century as functional psychology emerged as a cognitive science, theoretical interest in perception and judgment was supported by more focused empirical study. Egon Brunswik’s lens model provided a formal, testable representation of probabilistic functionalism that, by the late 1900s, had been elaborated and extended by Kenneth Hammond as social judgment theory. Using several components of the lens model to form a multilevel theory, this paper illustrates how the relationship between strategy and achievement can be viewed as the basic unit of both individual and group functioning. This is illustrated specifically by considering a case in which the legitimacy of an informant must be judged by law enforcement officials working independently and, subsequently, as an expert team.
