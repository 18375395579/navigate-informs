Title: Budget Creation and Control for Effective NPD Portfolio Management<br>Author: Raul Chao, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA, United States, raul.chao@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cheryl Gaimon, Stylianos Kavadias<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We develop an analytical model to explore how a business unit allocates resources between NPD programs under various incentive systems. Our focus is on incentives that vary autonomy through budget creation and/or budget control. Our results indicate that the optimal allocation of resources between existing product improvement (incremental programs) and new product development (revolutionary programs) can be altered by simple incentive schemes based on budget creation and control.
