Robin Keller, Tianjun Feng</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study an individual's consumption decisions along an inter-temporal horizon when health, safety and financial risks are involved.  Specifically, we propose a behavioral model to analyze individual consumption decisions by linking disparate streams of work on risk perception, time discounting, and consumption vs. savings patterns together. We further conduct a survey on Chinese subjects to test the model and obtain some managerial implications.</br>
