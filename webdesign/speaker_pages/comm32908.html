<br>Title: Host Country Efficiency in Services Offshoring: A Comparative Approach</br><br>Author: Eugene Hahn, Assistant Professor, Department of Information & Decision Sciences, Salisbury University, Salisbury, MD, 28101, United States, edhahn@salisbury.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Doh, Kraiwinee Bunyaratavej</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Service offshoring is an increasingly important aspect of the global economy. This phenomenon’s growth has lead to increased interest in services offshoring from a diverse set of groups. Yet to date empirical research in services offshoring has been somewhat limited.  In this study we empirically examine services offshoring capabilities of countries and compare them utilizing an efficiency-based perspective. Implications for management decision makers and governmental officials are discussed.</br>
