But they fail to account for the exceptional growth exhibited in recent year by country such as China where R&D expenditure is virtually non-existing and for the lack of growth observed in countries such as Japan where R&D expenditure is significant. We show that the presence of a high number of imitative (not incurring R&D expenditure) entrepreneurs can be sufficient to generate economic growth.</br>
