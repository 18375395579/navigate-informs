A production line exhibits several modes of failures, which cause a risk to the operations. Companies may wish to avoid, reduce or transfer risks to stay within this risk capacity. In this paper, various approaches of handling risks of failures are analyzed while trying to maximize profit under the constraints of risk capacity and maintenance resources.
