One difficulty lies in the confounding effects caused by the ancestry substructures. In our study, we propose a heuristic procedure to identify the ancestry-informative blocks, and to decompose the human genes into segments at different ancestry-informative levels. This study aims to provide more accurate estimation of the background allele frequencies for the association studies.</br>
