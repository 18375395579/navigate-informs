Schedule quality improves by reflecting seasonal variation and risk ranges around alternatives.  For 2006, the ATO Office of Strategy developed a set of future schedules that allows for consistent planning among FAA program offices.  The purpose of this paper is report on this development including core functions, verification and user implementation.</br>
