Title: Constraint Programming Approaches for Optimizing Inland Waterway Infrastructure Maintenance<br>Author: Ridvan Gedik, PhD Candidate, University of Arkansas, 1125 W Maple St,, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, rgedik@email.uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ed Pohl, Kenneth Mitchel, Heather Nachtmann, Chase Rainwater<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) dredges hundreds of navigation projects to make the waterways navigable. The USACE seeks to optimize the decision of allocating dredge resources to navigation projects under necessary system constraints including but not limited to:(i) environmental window restrictions (ii) resource availability, and (iii) varying equipment productivity rates. We discuss modeling aspects of this problem using constraint programming (CP) and logic-based Benders algorithms.
