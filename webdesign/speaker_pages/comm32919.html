The USACE seeks to optimize the decision of allocating dredge resources to navigation projects under necessary system constraints including but not limited to:(i) environmental window restrictions (ii) resource availability, and (iii) varying equipment productivity rates. We discuss modeling aspects of this problem using constraint programming (CP) and logic-based Benders algorithms.</br>
