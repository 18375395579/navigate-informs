<br>Title: Robust Capital Investment Decisions of Nonprofit Healthcare Organizations</br><br>Author: Shuyi Wang, Lehigh University, 217 W. Packer Ave. APT 209, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, shw210@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aurelie Thiele</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study focuses on capital investment decisions of nonprofit healthcare organizations, such as buying a MRI machine. Instead of using a single monetary metric (Total Net Present Value) combining NPV and social value, we consider social value separately in a non-monetary but quantitative way, such as gain in expected quality-of-life years. We then analyze trade-offs between NPV and social outputs in the context of sustainable nonprofits.</br>
