Title: Optimizing Screening Strategies for Chronic Diseases from a Dynamic Angle<br>Author: Marion Rauner, Associate Professor, University of Vienna, Bruennerstr. 72, Vienna, A-1230, Austria, marion.rauner@univie.ac.at<br>Coauthor(s): Walter Gutjahr, Joachim Wagner, Joseph Pasia, Kurt Heidenberger<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a dynamic risk-group oriented chronic disease model embedded within a Pareto Ant Colony Optimization of the policy variables. Policy-makers are provided with Pareto-optimal breast cancer screening schedules for risk groups by considering cost and effectiveness outcomes as well as budget constraints. We then discuss policy implications of 16 mammography screening scenarios varying the screening schedule and the rate of women tested.
