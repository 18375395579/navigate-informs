<br>Title: The Effects of In-App Purchase and New Introduction of Mobile Apps: Freemium vs. Paid</br><br>Author: Young Jin Lee, Assistant Professor, University of Denver, 2101 S. University Blvd., Denver, CO, 80208, United States of America, youngjinlee@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: There are two types of commercial mobile apps; freemium app and paid app. We study how In-app purchase and new introduction of the apps to an App Store ranking system can affect their long term performance in the App Store. Using app rank data in the Apple App Store in 2011, we found that freemium apps can benefit from in-app purchases more than paid apps. Our results also suggest paid apps can improve their performance by new introduction in the App Store.</br>
