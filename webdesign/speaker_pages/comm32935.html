<br>Title: Using Heuristics to Address Various Levels of Cascading and Restoration Knowledge of Adversaries</br><br>Author: Sinan Tas, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University, 1800 Broadcasting Road, Reading, PA, 19610, United States of America, sut12@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vicki Bier</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Our user-friendly, heuristic-based, and game-theoretic flow model enables the defender to address various concerns to a complex system, such as cascading failures or system recovery. Furthermore, it addresses less optimal but quite realistic attack scenarios, such as attacking certain component types with varying level of cascading knowledge and restoration process. In this talk, we will provide several examples for the latter.</br>
