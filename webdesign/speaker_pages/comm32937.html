Title: Comparison of Asian and American Terminal Operations<br>Author: Anne Goodchild, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Box 352700, 121E More Hall, Seattle, WA, 98195-2700, United States, annegood@u.washington.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present the results of a study comparing a variety of productivity measures for US and Asian marine terminals.  Models are developed for several key metrics and compared to empirical data with surprising results. Through this analysis we challenge some assumptions regarding the reasons for productivity differences at US and Asian marine terminals and suggest some alternative explanations.
