Title: Dynamic Models, Infectious Diseases and Operations Research<br>Author: Ping Yan, Manager, Modelling and Projection, Public Health Agency of Canada, Building 6, AL0602B, Tunney's Pasture, Ottawa, ON, K1A0K9, Canada, Ping_Yan@phac-aspc.gc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Fan Zhang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Models on transmission of infectious diseases are growing in quantity, complexity and variety. Strategies are aimed at reducing: (1) the initial growth of the “epidemic curve? (2) the peak burden by altering the shape of the curve; (3) the final outbreak size as the area under the curve. These goals can be weighted to formulate specific objectives. Control measures are challenged by constraints. By synthesizing, we show the interplay between mathematical epidemiology and operations research.
