We test theoretical predictions from different disciplines ?regarding the factors leading to the emergence of collaboration. We find that monetary rewards powerfully shape the effort that workers exert in their work. However, we also find substantial evidence for the existence of peer effects, whereby individuals exert more effort when other team members work harder.</br>
