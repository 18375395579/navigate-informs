Title: Network Modeling Framework to Predict Cognitive Decline<br>Author: W. Art Chaovalitwongse, Associate Professor, University of Washington, 3900 Stevens Way, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, artchao@uw.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sherry Willis, Paul Borghesani, Georgiy Presnyakov, Tom Grabowski<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Intrinsic connectivity networks, including the default mode network (DMN), can be identified via resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) and help illuminate large-scale connectivity underlying cognition and behavior. We investigated local, intra-nodal connectivity within nodes of the DMN using graph theory methods. We hypothesized that local connectivity of individual DMN nodes would differ with midlife cognitive trajectory, specifically with changes in executive function.
