Title: Comparison of Approaches to Untraded Asset Valuation<br>Author: Steve Derby, sgderby@pacbell.net<br>Coauthor(s): Ross Shachter<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine a range of approaches for the valuation of uncertain cash flows from untraded assets, with trading opportunities in a no-arbitrage market.  Traditional decision analytic valuation does not exploit market opportunities and provides a lower bound.  Standard financial option theory imposes conditions of completeness and provides an upper bound.
