We show that triage nurses & physicians adjust the number of diagnostic tests ordered per patient in response to the level of crowding in the system. During times of crowding, more diagnostic testing is ordered at triage in an effort to improve throughput. However, this leads to an overall increase in testing when the system is most congested.</br>
