Title: Risk Analysis and Game Theory: Two Policy Examples<br>Author: Elisabeth Pat?Cornell, Professor and chair, Stanford University, Terman Building Room 340, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, mep@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Kucik<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We show two examples of modeling and simulation of a game between a government and an opponent to assess the risk of some public policies given the response of the other side.  In one case, the US government faces one or more terrorist groups and needs to collect intelligence information in time to take action; in the other, a government is trying to balance the immediate need for security and the long-term goal of solving fundamental problems that fuel an insurgency.
