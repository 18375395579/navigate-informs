<br>Title: Representing Uncertainty in Decision Support</br><br>Author: Harvey Greenberg, Professor, University of Colorado at Denver, Mathematics Department, Denver, CO, 173364, United States, Harvey.Greenberg@cudenver.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: There are more than 20 measures of uncertainty -- probability, possibility, plausibility, rough sets, and more.  How do we know which is the right choice in an OR/MS situation?  Once we decide measurement, how do we represent it in a model -- recourse, chance-constrained, robust, [C]VaR, or some other risk metric? The problem I shall address is how to make that decision.  I do not know how to do this, so my talk will merely organize what needs to be done.</br>
