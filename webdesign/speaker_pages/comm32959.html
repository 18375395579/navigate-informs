Seasonal demand for NICU has not been fully explored in scheduling its staff. We present some of our new findings in NICU staffing problem. Our staffing models take into account seasonal demand and staff preferences on scheduling. Results show that our models can not only reduce the burden of staffing scheduling, but also improve efficiency in staff utilization.</br>
