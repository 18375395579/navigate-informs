The firm chooses both capacity and quality levels and also the marketing strategy and investment level. Because the nature of the consumer behavior is heavily dependent on both the operations and marketing strategy, there is a natural tradeoff between these strategies. We model the effects of operations and marketing decisions on both the customer acquisition and retention processes and create an elaborate model of customer equity.</br>
