Title: Default Risk Premia and Asset Returns<br>Author: Antje Berndt, Assistant Professor of Finance, Tepper School of Business, GSIA 335, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, aberndt@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Iulian Obreja, Aziz Lookmann<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate the source for common variation in the portion of returns on corporate debt that is not explained by changes in risk-free rates or expected default losses. We extract a latent common component from firm-specific changes in default risk premia that is orthogonal to known systematic risk factors. Asset pricing tests suggest that our DRP factor is priced in the corporate bond market, and helps explaining returns on short-term, OTM put options. For equity markets, results are mixed.
