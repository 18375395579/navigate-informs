Title: The Effects of Stochastic Market Clearing on the Cost of Wind Integration: A Case of NZEM<br>Author: Javad Khazaei, Princeton University, Dept. of ORFE, Princeton, NJ, United States of America, jkhazaei@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Geoff Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Implementing a stochastic electricity market clearing, as a suggested alternative to conventional clearing mechanisms, can impose some extra cost on the market. Therefore, it is essential to estimate the efficiency gain resulting from implementing a stochastic market clearing mechanism. We describe the result of an empirical study to quantify value of a stochastic clearing mechanism for the New Zealand electricity market. We extend our analysis for possible larger wind integration in the future.
