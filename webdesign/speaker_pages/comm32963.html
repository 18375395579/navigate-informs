Therefore, it is essential to estimate the efficiency gain resulting from implementing a stochastic market clearing mechanism. We describe the result of an empirical study to quantify value of a stochastic clearing mechanism for the New Zealand electricity market. We extend our analysis for possible larger wind integration in the future.</br>
