Title: The Economics of Joint Production in Services<br>Author: Guillaume Roels, Assistant Professor, UCLA, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, 90095, United States of America, guillaume.roels@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk, we propose a classification of services based on the degree of complementarity or substitutability between the provider’s and the client’s efforts. We study how efforts change when they become more complementary and when their distribution shifts from the service provider to the client. We identify non-monotone effects of these changes, revealing a trade-off between operational efficiency, leading to more specialization, and complementarity, pushing for greater effort alignment.
