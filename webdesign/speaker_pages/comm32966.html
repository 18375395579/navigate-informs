<br>Title: The Impact of Quality Exploration and Exploitation on Sustainable Production Systems</br><br>Author: Graça Silva, Assistant Professor, ISEG, Rua do Quelhas, n.?6, Lisbon, 1200-781, Portugal, gracamsilva@iseg.utl.pt</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paulo Gomes</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a model to explain how firm level quality exploration and quality exploitation capabilities impact sustainable production. The data come from ISO 9000 registered manufacturing firms. Structural equation modeling analyses show that while quality exploitation capabilities strongly influence sustainable production quality exploration has no impact. The findings also reveal that sustainable production contributes for enhancing operational performance.</br>
