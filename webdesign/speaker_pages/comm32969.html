<br>Title: Is Automatic Telephonic Assessment Reliable and Valid for Depression Screening and Monitoring?</br><br>Author: Shinyi Wu, Assistant Professor, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Avenue, GER 240C, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, shinyiwu@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pai Liu, Irene Vidyanti, Elizabeth Mendez, Caitlin Hawkins, Kathleen Ell, Jeffrey Guterman</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Management of depression requires periodic screening and monitoring to assess symptoms and reduce recurrence. Time-pressured healthcare providers are unable to routinely provide this communication. Automated Telephonic Assessment holds promise for quality and productivity improvement. This research examines the reliability and clinical validity of an ATA system in a depression clinical trial and contributes methods to test ATA quality and identify alternative designs for better care management.</br>
