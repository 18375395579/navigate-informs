Title: Budget Creation and Control for Effective NPD Portfolio Management<br>Author: Stylianos Kavadias, Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Management, 800 West Peachtree Street, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308-0520, United States, Stylianos.Kavadias@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Raul Chao, Cheryl Gaimon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper we explore how a manager allocates resources between NPD programs under various organization design mechanisms that determine how the NPD budget is created and controlled.   We consider the allocation of resources between existing product improvement (incremental projects) and new product development (radical projects).  Our results indicate that autonomy, in terms of how the NPD budget is determined, does not always favor radical innovation. Managerial implications are discussed.
