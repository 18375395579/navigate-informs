Erpf Professor, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, 423 Uris Hall, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, lvg1@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sergei Savin, Yina Lu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A severe U.S. primary care physician shortage has been forecast for the coming years. However, estimates are based on simple ratios and do not consider patients?ability to get timely access to care. They also do not quantify the impact of emerging new methods of delivering care. We show that implementation of some increasingly popular operational changes can completely offset the projected increase in demand for physician services while increasing access to care.</br>
