Seen in a larger game theoretic framework, this may cause problems because while countries see an individual game, the pharmaceutical firm sees a repeated, linked game.  A theoretical mixed integer linear model of the firm’s launch and pricing decisions is presented along with examples wherein international price dependencies most likely played a role.</br>
