Title: The Impact of IT and Knowledge Management on Supply Chain Performance<br>Author: Chandrasekar Subramaniam, Assistant Professor, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, 9201 University City Blvd, Charlotte, NC, 28223, United States of America, csubrama@uncc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yuan Niu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: One of the major shifts in supply chain (SC) relationships is the emphasis on collaboration with SC partners. Despite this recognition of the role of SC collaboration, there is little research that theorizes an SC’s KM capability. This paper proposes a framework relating IT capability and KM capability and their impact on SC performance. The contributions of our research include advancing the theory on SC value creation and improving our understanding of IT in supply chains.
