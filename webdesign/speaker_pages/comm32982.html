On one hand, an SDU alleviates ICU congestion by providing a safe care environment for post-ICU patients before they can be transferred to the general wards.  On the other hand, SDUs can take capacity away from the already over-congested ICU. We propose a queueing model that provides SDU sizing guidelines, noting that under some circumstances this optimal size is zero.</br>
