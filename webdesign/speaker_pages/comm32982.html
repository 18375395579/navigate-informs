Title: Step-Down Units in Hospitals: Benefits and Pitfalls<br>Author: Mor Armony, Stern School of Business, NYU, New York, United States of America, marmony@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Carri Chan, Bo Zhu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The use of Step-Down units (SDUs) in hospitals has been a matter of controversy in the medical community. On one hand, an SDU alleviates ICU congestion by providing a safe care environment for post-ICU patients before they can be transferred to the general wards.  On the other hand, SDUs can take capacity away from the already over-congested ICU. We propose a queueing model that provides SDU sizing guidelines, noting that under some circumstances this optimal size is zero.
