<br>Title: Repeat Purchase Decisions in Technology Adoption</br><br>Author: Canan Ulu, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, IROM, B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Canan.Ulu@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Smith</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Consumers contemplating replacing a technology they own with a new one need to think about future adoption decisions and uncertainties about future innovations. We formulate this problem as a dynamic programming model and study its structural properties: What changes in benefits and costs make the consumer better off?  Decreases in costs and increases in benefits are good for the consumer, but how is she willing to trade off between increased costs and increased benefits (or decreases in both)?</br>
