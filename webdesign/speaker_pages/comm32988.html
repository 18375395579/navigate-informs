Title: Approximating Pseudo-Boolean Functions<br>Author: Guoli Ding, Professor, Louisiana State University, Department of Mathematics, Baton Rouge, LA, 70803, United States, ding@math.lsu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The purpose of this talk is to present explicit formulas for approximating a pseudo-Boolean function with linear and other low degree functions.  These formulas generalize earlier results of Hammer-Holzman and Grabisch-Marichal-Roubens, as well as a result of Charnes-Golany-Keane-Rousseau on Shapley values.
