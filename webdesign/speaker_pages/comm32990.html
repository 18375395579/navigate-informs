<br>Title: Energy Informatics in Transportation Systems: Combining Telematics Data with O.R.</br><br>Author: Sudip Bhattacharjee, Associate Professor, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, United States of America, sbhattacharjee@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alex Tung</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Empty trailer trips (backhaul) lead to revenue loss, pollution, fuel consumption, and cost over a billion dollars each year. We use telematics data to match routes for “backhaul brokering? Data analytics is used to create maps of trailer movement and frequent patterns. Subsequently, optimization provides tools to choose revenue enhancing and energy saving routes. This contributes to the emerging area of energy informatics where energy optimization and revenue are key to business sustainability.</br>
