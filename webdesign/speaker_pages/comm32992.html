Murat Kristal, Assistant Professor, York University, Schulich School of Business, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada, mkristal@schulich.yorku.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aleda Roth</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We empirically investigate the underlying structure of supply-demand base adaptivity in terms of exploration and exploitation activities, and assess its effect on business performance. Our evidence suggests that exploratory adaptivity activities are as important as those of exploitative adaptivity. Though pressured by short-term performance measures, supply chain managers should not be forced to focus only on short-term efficiency plans for their supply chains.</br>
