Title: Hurry Up and Wait: Differential Impact of Load on Patient Length of Stay<br>Author: Jillian Berry Jaeker, Harvard Business School, Soldiers Field, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, jjaeker@hbs.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: High work load impacts patient LOS, but prior OM studies have found conflicting results regarding direction. Thus, it is difficult to predict load’s effects on productivity a priori, inhibiting effective capacity management in high load systems. We categorize load at 283 hospitals into current patient census (congestion) and incoming patients, decomposing the latter into its levels of pressure and predictability, and quantify the magnitudes and directions of change on LOS.
