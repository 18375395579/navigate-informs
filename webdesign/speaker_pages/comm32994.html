Title: Felicity during Anticipation and Recall<br>Author: Manel Baucells, Rand Corporation and University Pompeu Fabra, 1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, CA, 90401, United States of America, manel.baucells@upf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Silvia Bellezza<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a set of psychologically plausible assumptions that yield the felicity, moment-utility, function of a given episode, including the anticipation and recall. The felicity function is U-shaped during anticipation. Shortening anticipation makes the event more surprising, and leads to an increase in utility from recall. The model has prescriptive recommendations to help cope for negative events. We provide empirical evidence in favor of the main implications of the model.
