The hospital opened a new cardiac operating room in 2006 and they decided to use operations research methods and simulation to determine the best method for planning the surgical schedule.  Major issues included the availability of resources such as ICU beds, ward beds and nursing staff. The paper discusses the application as well as the considerable post-implementation effort.
