Title: A Model of Rational Retrials in Queues<br>Author: Shiliang Cui, Doctoral Student, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, scui@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Senthil Veeraraghavan, Xuanming Su<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a queueing setting in which a rational consumer can choose to retry a service later, at a cost, on observing the congestion at the system (e.g. lines at the DMV). Thus he may join, balk or retry. Such consumer retrials could be costly, and have both positive and negative externalities. We show that under specific conditions, allowing consumers to retry improves throughput at the service, and may also improve consumer and social welfare.
