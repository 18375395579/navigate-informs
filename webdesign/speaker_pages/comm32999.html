Title: Reinforcement Learning in Post-disaster Management and Response<br>Author: Yueyue Fan, Assistant Professor, University of California, Department of CEE, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, yyfan@ucdavis.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Post-disaster relief and rescue activities are often carried out when information about damages is not completely revealed.  In this situation, decisions need to be made simultaneously as the environment being learned.  In this presentation, we will introduce reinforcement learning that integrates exploring and exploiting the environment and will demonstrate its potential applications in post-disaster management and response activities through examples of goal finding and resource allocation.
