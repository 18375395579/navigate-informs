In this situation, decisions need to be made simultaneously as the environment being learned.  In this presentation, we will introduce reinforcement learning that integrates exploring and exploiting the environment and will demonstrate its potential applications in post-disaster management and response activities through examples of goal finding and resource allocation.</br>
