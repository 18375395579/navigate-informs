Miguel Brendl</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We show that people heuristically infer the relative frequency of a class of stimuli from the relative value of these stimuli. They judge what is more valuable as relatively scarcer. In three studies, we demonstrate the operation of this value heuristic and the resulting judgmental bias in frequency estimates of stimuli with either inherent (photos of attractive human faces in Experiment 1) or experimentally induced, monetary value (pictures of other species in Experiment 2 and displays of abstract letter combinations in Experiment 3). We discuss implications of the heuristic for people’s choice behavior in a variety of domains and for their economic intuitions and understanding of market mechanisms.</br>
