We develop an optimizing algorithm that allows a mix of both same-day open access appointments and longer-term forward appointments.   Our algorithm maximizes clinic utility by trading off the benefits of clinic productivity with the costs of patient waiting and clinic overtime.  Results demonstrate the optimum mix of open-access and long-term appointments under a variety of conditions.</br>
