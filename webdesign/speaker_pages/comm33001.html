Title: Comparison of Idea Generation Processes<br>Author: Karan Girotra, INSEAD, karan.girotra@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch, Karl Ulrich<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present results from an experimental study that compares three different idea generating structures- individuals working by themselves, individuals working in groups and a new hybrid structure, where individual work is followed by group work. In contrast to the existing research that has focused on comparing the number and average quality of ideas generated; we study the quality of the best ideas generated by the three different structures.
