Liu, Associate Professor, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, henryliu@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jianfeng Zheng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In the current state-of-the-practice, traffic signals are being re-timed manually for every 3-5 years or longer because the retiming process is labor intensive. In this talk, we will introduce a performance fine-tuning tool that aims to reduce the retiming cost by leveraging the massive high-resolution event-based traffic signal data.</br>
