Title: A Data-driven Performance Fine-tuning Tool for Arterial Traffic Signal Systems<br>Author: Henry X. Liu, Associate Professor, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, henryliu@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jianfeng Zheng<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In the current state-of-the-practice, traffic signals are being re-timed manually for every 3-5 years or longer because the retiming process is labor intensive. In this talk, we will introduce a performance fine-tuning tool that aims to reduce the retiming cost by leveraging the massive high-resolution event-based traffic signal data.
