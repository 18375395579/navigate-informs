In this research, we extend prior work by analyzing consumer responses to disaggregate review information. We find that reviews that the community finds helpful have a stronger impact on consumer purchase decisions than other reviews do. Moreover, these reviews have a stronger impact on less popular books than more popular books, where consumers may be able to use outside information sources to evaluate products.</br>
