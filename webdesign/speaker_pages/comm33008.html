<br>Title: Optimal Investments, Divestments and Maintenance in Railroad Infrastructure under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Arnt-Gunnar Lium, Research scientist, SINTEF, S.P. Andersens vei 5, Trondheim, 7465, Norway, arnt-gunnar.lium@sintef.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Truls Flatberg, Marte Fodstad, Michal Kaut</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a model that enables the traditional cost benefit analysis to take into account portfolio effects associated with strategic investments in railroad infrastructure, while at the same addressing exogenous uncertainty. The model is to be applied by the Norwegian infrastructure manager (Jernbaneverket) in their investment decisions.</br>
