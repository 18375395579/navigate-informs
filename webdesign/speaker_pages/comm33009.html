<br>Title: Considering the Economics of Performance Metrics in Fire Management Planning</br><br>Author: Doug Rideout, Dept. of Forest, Rangeland, and Watershed Stewardship, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523, United States, doug.rideout@colostate.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The shift to ecosystem management has important implications for fire policy and how the performance of fire systems are perceived and analyzed.  While economists have improved the measurement theory and technology for non-market valuation, development of theory and techniques for performance metrics has lagged.  This paper addresses the need for sound performance metrics in fire management planning.  Key principles applicable to economically sound performance metrics are addressed.</br>
