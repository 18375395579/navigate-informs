We survey the literature on the pros/cons of Critical Chain Project Management and discuss strategies for holding this debate with students. Second, we share questions that students ask during the reading, but as far as we know, have not been answered by scholars. Finally, we present numerical examples to reinforce the concepts and highlight complications Goldratt ignored.
