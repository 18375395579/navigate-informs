<br>Title: A Simulation Approach for Inventory Management at Hacettepe University Hospitals?Blood Center</br><br>Author: Banu Yuksel-Ozkaya, Hacettepe University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, byuksel@hacettepe.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Murat Caner Testik, Salih Aksu, Osman Ilhami Ozcebe, Volkan Sonmez</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Necessity for an effective management of blood banks, emerge from the short life times for components of blood and the uncertainty of the supply from donors. Apart from these, unsatisfied demand and disposal of blood components (at the end of their lifetimes) are vital, from both humanitarian and cost points of view. In this study, we analyze the blood inventory management of Hacettepe University Hospitals?Blood Center using simulation techniques and discuss improvement recommendations.</br>
