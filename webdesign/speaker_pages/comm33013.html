Apart from these, unsatisfied demand and disposal of blood components (at the end of their lifetimes) are vital, from both humanitarian and cost points of view. In this study, we analyze the blood inventory management of Hacettepe University Hospitals?Blood Center using simulation techniques and discuss improvement recommendations.
