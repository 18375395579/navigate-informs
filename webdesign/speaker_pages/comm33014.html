Title: Service Systems with Anecdotal Reasoning Consumers<br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, United States of America, chen@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yimin Yu, Tingliang Huang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study service systems where consumers have boundedly rational expectations. In particular, we assume that consumers lack full capability or ample opportunity to perfectly infer the waiting time, and thus can only rely on past experiences and anecdotal reasoning to make their joining or balking decisions.
