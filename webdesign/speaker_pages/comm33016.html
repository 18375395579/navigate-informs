<br>Title: Economically Efficient Capacity Planning for Grid Computing</br><br>Author: Jörn Altmann, Professor, School of Information Technology, International University of Bruchsal, Campus 3, Bruchsal, 76646, Germany, jorn.altmann@acm.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jun Shu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: An open issue about Grid computing is the lack of tools for capacity planning. We present a model for capacity planning that takes into consideration costs of contributions of different providers. This includes pricing of servers, possible congestion charges, and the risk of unavailable resources. The model is expected to provide answers to under what set of constraints fine-grained resource allocation is economically efficient and what kind of strategy to apply for capacity planning.</br>
