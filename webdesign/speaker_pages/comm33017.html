Title: When Practices Diffuse in a Bubble: Reverse Mergers and the Internet Wave<br>Author: Peggy Lee, WP Carey - ASU, 300 E.

In doing so, we synthesize information-based theories of imitation with institutional theory to explain the growth and decline of reverse mergers (RM) of internet firms during the time of the internet wave (1998-2000). Our results show a clear two-stage pattern, with early RMs done by established firms, and late RMs done by fledgling firms. We also find evidence of an early mover advantage.
