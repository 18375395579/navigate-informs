<br>Title: Scheduling First-Year Seminars</br><br>Author: Kevin Hutson, Furman University, Greenville, SC, United States of America, kevin.hutson@furman.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ellen Rogerson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: First-year seminars are designed to help incoming students adjust to college-level material and work load.  At Furman, this seminar is broken into two courses:  FYS and FYW courses (FYW's are writing intensive).  Incoming students are required to take one of each of these courses in their first two terms and are scheduled for both before they arrive to campus.  Here we discuss algorithms for scheduling students to these courses and compare the algorithms on the basis of different objectives.</br>
