Title: Empirical and Simulation Analysis of Volunteer Convergence Following a Large-Scale Disaster<br>Author: Emmett Lodree, The University of Alabama, 361 Stadium Drive, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States of America, ejlodree@cba.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lauren Davis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Volunteer convergence in response to large-scale disasters often overwhelms the agencies responsible for managing relief efforts. Using data collected during the 2011 tornado relief efforts in Tuscaloosa Alabama, this study characterizes the stochastic processes relevant to convergence within the context of a disaster-relief warehouse queuing system. Volunteer task assignment policies are also examined through simulation experiments.
