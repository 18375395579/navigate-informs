Title: Co-evolving Networks: From Telecom to Social to Disease Networks<br>Author: Nitesh Chawla, University of Notre Dame, 384 Nieuwland Science Hall, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, United States of America, nchawla@nd.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The process of link formation/dissolution is a fundamental aspect of evolution of  networks over time. However, to effectively predict this process over time is a challenging problem that may require an intimate understanding of the topologies and flows of each network, network endogeneity and co-evolution, as well as node attributes. In this talk, I will present the theory, analytics and models for link formation over time.
