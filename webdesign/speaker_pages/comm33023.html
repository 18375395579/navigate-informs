State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907-2056, United States, norrisjb@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Herb Moskowitz, Suresh Chand, Deanna Willis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: With healthcare costs exceeding 15% of the US economy and rising and unpaid medical bills the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in America, costs are reaching epidemic proportions; yet some facilities are not fully utilized.  Scheduling physicians and reserving appointments to meet demand can both improve care by providing care when it is needed and reduce costs by better utilizing existing resources.
