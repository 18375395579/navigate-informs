Helen Street, PO Box 210108, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, kcarl@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Moshe Dror</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Bicycling has garnered interest in recent years. Perceived exertion is an important consideration when selecting bicycling tours. We propose a model for generating measures of perceived exertion for bicycling tours for 5 categories of riders. We present results of a survey designed to verify the accuracy of our model and demonstrate a good fit with exertion values reported by cyclists.</br>
