Professor, Duke University, Nicholas Sch. of Environment, Box 90328, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, richard.anderson@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Clemen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Multiple elicitations of MAUT weights by different methods is recommended decision-analytic practice, typically followed by attempts to reconcile any differences.  An important question is what happens and what should happen during weight reconciliation.  We address this issue, discussing previous research as well as results of a recent pilot study in an environmental decision context.</br>
