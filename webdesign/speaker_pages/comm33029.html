Title: Positional Uncertainty in Coverage Modeling<br>Author: Alan Murray, Professor, Arizona State University, P.O. Box 875302, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, atmurray@asu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Coverage models have proven to be both theoretically interesting and of great practical significance. This paper reviews aspects of positional uncertainty and how this may impact coverage modeling. Extensions to account for positional uncertainty as well as empirical applications are detailed.
