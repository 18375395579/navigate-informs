Research on how to adequately measure and assess IDMC can help to create a better understanding of the different aspects of IDMC, capture an individual’s status quo of decision-making performance, describe areas for improvement, and therefore, guide the teaching of decision-making skills. The present research aims to construct a psychometric test for IDMC, which measures mainly the quality of application of decision-making rules as taught by prescriptive decision science.</br>
