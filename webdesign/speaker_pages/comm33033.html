Title: Building More Robust and Informative Cost-Effectiveness Models<br>Author: Megan DeFauw, PhD Student, University of Michigan, Industrial and Operations Engineering, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States of America, mcdefauw@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vijayan Nair, Joseph Norman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This presentation deals with improvements to cost-effectiveness models for chronic diseases. Instead of focusing on just the cost-effectiveness ratio, we consider the joint distributions of costs and QALYs over time and present preliminary results. These distributions present provide considerably more information to the decision-makers. In addition, we explore the limitations of the constant baseline hazard assumption and suggest more general models.
