<br>Title: Measuring the Performance of Large-Scale Combinatorial Auctions: A Structural Estimation Approach</br><br>Author: Sang Won Kim, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, skim14@gsb.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marcelo Olivares, Gabriel Weintraub</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a structural estimation method to uncover bidders?costs from bidding data in large-scale combinatorial auctions (CAs). We apply the method to the Chilean auction for school meals in which the government procures half a billion dollars worth of meal services every year. Based on the cost estimates, we measure the performance of the CA in terms of cost efficiency and payments to the bidders. We also perform counterfactuals to evaluate alternative mechanisms such as VCG.</br>
