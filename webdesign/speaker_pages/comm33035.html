Title: FY11 NextGen Performance Assessment<br>Author: Almira Ramadani, FAA, NextGen, Systems Analysis and Modeling, 800 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC, 20591, United States of America, almira.ramadani@faa.gov<br>Coauthor(s): E.J. Spear<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This presentation summarizes operational performance impacts of a subset of NextGen capabilities fielded in FY11, for which the required empirical data was available, and enough time has passed since the implementation for a meaningful analysis to be possible.  For each of the NextGen capabilities, we explain our methodology for identifying key performance metrics, present operational and performance impacts we expected to observe, and elaborate actual outcomes we observed post-deployment.
