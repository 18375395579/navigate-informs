Title: Empirical Investigation of Service Allocation Decisions with Out-Sourced Centers<br>Author: Baohong Sun, Asscciate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, bsun@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shibo Li<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Firms view call centers as preferred channels to manage customer relationship (CRM). We treat service duration as a measurement of operating cost and a determinant of customer retention. We propose a framework that allows the firm to learn about heterogeneous customers and make optimal allocation decisions that best match customer preference for service duration. Applying the framework to a call history data, we demonstrate that marketing effectiveness can be improved in a cost efficient way.
