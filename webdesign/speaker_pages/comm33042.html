Title: Pushing Performance Frontier through Globalization: Asset Allocation and Operational Efficiencies<br>Author: Jie Zhang, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, United States of America, jz@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Justin Ren, Anil Khurana, Nitin Joglekar<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Globalization requires that firms leverage their value network by allocating assets and build efficient operations. We examine how a firm's asset allocation decisions impact its operational efficiency. We build on the Theory of Performance Frontiers (Schmenner and Swink 1998) to distinguish two kinds of efficiencies - technical and allocative. We test empirically whether performance can be improved by balancing these two efficiencies through strategic investments in fixed and relational assets.
