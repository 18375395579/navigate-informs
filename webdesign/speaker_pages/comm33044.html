<br>Title: Perceptions of On-line Education</br><br>Author: Christina Scherrer, Assistant Professor, Southern Polytechnic State University, Department of Industrial Engineering Tec, 1100 S. Marietta Parkway, Marietta, GA, 30060, United States of America, cscherre@spsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Renee Butler, Shekinah Burns</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Our university currently offers some masters degrees completely on-line and additional graduate and undergraduate courses in both on-line and hybrid formats. Using results from a comprehensive survey, we characterize the types of students on-line education is most suited for and which delivery methods work best for various student groups.  In addition, we study differences in perceptions of on-line education that exist between students who have and have not actually taken an on-line course.</br>
