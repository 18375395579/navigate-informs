Title: Using Optimization to Protect Your Water Supply from Attack<br>Author: Mark Houck, Professor, George Mason University, CEIE Dept, MS 6C1, Fairfax, VA, 22030-4444, United States of America, mhouck@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zbigniew Skolicki, Tomasz Arciszewski<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Municipal water supply systems in the United States are remarkably reliable and resilient in the face of traditional threats but are less secure from the threat of terrorists.  Optimization can be used to address this threat, and minimize the effectiveness and risk of this type of attack.  A hypothetical but realistic example of optimally protecting a water supply system from attack is used to illustrate the process.
