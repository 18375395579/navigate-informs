In discussion fora, people naturally form groups and subgroups aligning along points of consensus and contention. In this talk, I will present our work on subgroup modeling and detection in both Arabic and English social media language. This work is the beginning of an interesting exploration into the realm of building computational  models of some aspects of the sociopragmatics of human language.</br>
