Title: Computational Modeling of Sociopragmatic Language Use in Arabic and English Social Media<br>Author: Mona Diab, George Washington University, Washington, DC, United States of America, mtdiab@gwu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Social media language is a treasure trove for mining and understanding human interactions. In discussion fora, people naturally form groups and subgroups aligning along points of consensus and contention. In this talk, I will present our work on subgroup modeling and detection in both Arabic and English social media language. This work is the beginning of an interesting exploration into the realm of building computational  models of some aspects of the sociopragmatics of human language.
