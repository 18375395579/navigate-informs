<br>Title: Modeling Survivability for Emergency Medical Service Systems</br><br>Author: Laura McLay, Assistant Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, Statistics & Operations Research, 1001 W Main Street, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States, lamclay@vcu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jason Merrick</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Recent medical studies indicate that traditional approaches for managing and modeling emergency medical service systems do not maximize survivability for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.  This presentation explores issues for modeling patient survivability, and explicitly ties logistical issues of locating emergency medical service vehicles to patient outcomes.</br>
