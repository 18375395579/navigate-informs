Title: Acceptance and Planning of Dynamically Arriving Offers in an Over-Demanded Organization.<br>Author: Jade Herbots, K.U.Leuven, Research Center for OM, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, B-3000, Belgium, jade.herbots@econ.kuleuven.be<br>Coauthor(s): Willy Herroelen, Roel Leus<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: When a project is offered to an over-demanded organization, a quick acceptance decision is often required, while the company has only little knowledge of the project under discussion. We develop an approach that integrates order acceptance and resource capacity loading. Therefore we use a dynamic programming method that optimizes the company’s expected profits. Here from we derive insights about the optimal allocation of capacity when accepting projects.
