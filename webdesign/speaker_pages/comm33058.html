In 1950 he joined the Weapons System Evaluation Group, an OR group for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  He then joined the Operations Research Office of the US Army and worked on a variety of OR projects in the US and overseas.  In late 1956 he joined Matson Navigation to build the first Research Department in a steamship company.  OR studies of Matson’s shipping operations led to pioneering the implementation of a complete system concept for containerization in steamship operations.
