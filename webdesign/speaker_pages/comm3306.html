Title: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accounting: Allocating Emissions from Processes to Co-Products<br>Author: Nur Sunar, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, Stanford, CA, United States of America, nsunar@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erica Plambeck<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: To implement border adjustment on imports or to evaluate the carbon footprint of a supply chain, one must specify how to allocate the emissions from a process among its co-products.  For example, emissions could be allocated in proportion to the economic value or in proportion to the mass of co-products.  We investigate the implications of the allocation rule (and flexibility therein) for GHG emissions, firms?profits, and social welfare.
