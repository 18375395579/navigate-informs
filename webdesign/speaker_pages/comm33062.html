PMaP uses concepts from primal heuristics such as local branching and RINS to create work for many different processors very quickly in such a way that the overlap (if any) is minimal. Computational results indicate that PMaP is competitive with a state-of-the-art commercial parallel branch-and-bound solver on 32 processors; moreover, unlike commercial codes, it can exploit many times more processors than this.</br>
