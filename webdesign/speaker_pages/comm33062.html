Title: A Parallel Macro Partitioning (PMaP) Framework for Large Mixed Integer Programs<br>Author: Andrew Miller, ajmiller5@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mahdi Namazifar<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss a recently developed parallel framework for solving MIP's. PMaP uses concepts from primal heuristics such as local branching and RINS to create work for many different processors very quickly in such a way that the overlap (if any) is minimal. Computational results indicate that PMaP is competitive with a state-of-the-art commercial parallel branch-and-bound solver on 32 processors; moreover, unlike commercial codes, it can exploit many times more processors than this.
