Shortcoming include: 1)visually representing a comprehensive TRM for decision making purposes 2)systematically identifying links between market drivers and products. A new three-phased process is purposed that includes Feature-based Analysis and Cluster-based Grouping. For demonstration it’s applied to Care Management Plus(CMP) a care management product under development at Oregon Health & Science University(OHSU).
