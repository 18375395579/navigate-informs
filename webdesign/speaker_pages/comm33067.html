Title: Performance-based Ground Delay Program Decision-making using Multiple Criteria : Single Airport Case<br>Author: Yi Liu, University of California, Berkeley, 107 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, liuyi.feier@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop performance metrics for capacity, efficiency and predictability, and show how these metrics may be traded off in the design of Ground Delay Program (GDP) under capacity uncertainty. We link the performance to the decisions on GDP clearance time and the scope of the program. This capability allows the service provider to make performance-based GDP decisions using multiple criteria.
