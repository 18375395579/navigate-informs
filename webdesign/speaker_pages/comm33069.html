Title: Specifying Digital Forensics: Formalizing Forensics Policies<br>Author: Barbara Endicott-Popovsky, Director, Center for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity (CIAC), University of Washington, Box 354985 4311-11th Ave NE, Seattle, WA, 98199, United States, endicott@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Deborah Frincke, Carol Taylor<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Digital forensic practice is often ad-hoc and generally lacks widely accepted models or principles. As the field matures, advances are needed in how forensic capabilities are specified, implemented and verified. In this paper we propose a method for specifying forensic properties borrowed from the computer security domain. Our previous work stated forensic policies informally; here we formalize forensics policies in order to add preciseness and eliminate potential fuzziness in policy definition.
