Title: Optimal Magnetic Sweeping Design for Metastatic Cancer Tumor Treatment<br>Author: So Yeon Chun, Assistant Professor, Georgetown University, McDonough School of Business, 37th and O Streets, Washington DC, 20057, United States of America, sc1286@georgetown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alek Nacev, Benjamin Shapiro<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from the place where it first started to another place in the body. Patients with metastatic cancer have thousands of tumors spread throughout their body and it is recognized that many of these tumors are poorly vascularized compared to normal tissues. To improve poor chemotherapeutic efficacy in metastases, we control magnets to sweep chemotherapy. We analyze autopsy data of thousands of tumors and optimize magnetic pulling treatment parameters.
