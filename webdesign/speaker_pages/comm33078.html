Title: Implicit Mapping Theorems in Variational Analysis<br>Author: R. Tyrrell Rockafellar, Professor Emeritus, University of Washington, Department of Mathematics, Box 354350, Seattle, WA, 98195-4350, United States, rtr@math.washington.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The classical implicit function concerns the way that the solution to a system of equations depends on parameters in the system, in particular whether the solution is nicely behaved function of the parameters in a local sense.  This talk will describe advances that have been made in that direction when equations are replaced by generalized equations, for instance variational inequalities.
