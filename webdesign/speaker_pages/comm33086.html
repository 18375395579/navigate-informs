Dabkowski, Instructor of Systems Engineering, Department of Systems Engineering, 646 Swift Road, Building 752, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, Matthew.Dabkowski@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Dees, Terry Bresnick, Gregory Parnell<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Originally multiple objective decision analysis obtained the measure range using the extreme outcomes of existing alternatives (Alternative-Focused Thinking).
