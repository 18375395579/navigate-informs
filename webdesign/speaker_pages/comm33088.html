The macro view of this field currently relies on practitioners and academics from a wide variety of disciplines, viewpoints, and geographies to develop both practical and theoretical perspectives.  A three round service management research study is presented, reflecting collective understanding of collaborators from more around 100 countries.  An analysis of Rounds 1 and 2 of this study will be presented here.</br>
