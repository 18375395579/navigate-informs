Title: Teaching Computational Discrete Optimization<br>Author: Andreas Alpers, Visiting Assistant Professor, School of ORIE, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, alpers@orie.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Leslie E. Trotter<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk I will share my personal experience in teaching an advanced undergraduate level course in computational discrete optimization at Cornell. Freely available software is used throughout the course to illustrate various aspects of current branch-and-cut technology. In particular, I will discuss the classroom use of CONCORDE, the current world record holder for solving Traveling Salesman problem instances.
