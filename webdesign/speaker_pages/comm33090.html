Title: Service-dominant Logic 2.0: Towards a Balanced View of Service Management<br>Author: Larry Menor, Associate Professor, University of Western Ontario, Richard Ivey School of Business, 1151 Richmond Street North, London, ON, N6A3K7, Canada, lmenor@ivey.uwo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Scott Sampson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This research critically examines the assumptions and foundational premises underlying the Service-Dominant (S-D) logic and posits a more balanced view (i.e., S-D Logic 2.0) of services management from an OM perspective. We empirically scrutinize how insightful the original and revised logics are for the management of services. We believe our S-D logic 2.0 foundational premises provide greater service science insights on how services are best defined, designed, delivered and diagnosed.
