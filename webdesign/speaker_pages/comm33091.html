Title: Enlisting the Community in its Own Preparedness<br>Author: Deena Disraelly, Research Staff Member, Institute for Defense Analyses, 4850 Mark Center Drive, Alexandria, VA, 22311, United States of America, ddisrael@ida.org<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In the past six years, we’ve seen both man-made and natural disasters. Largely in the news following these events was what the government should have done, before the events to prevent them or after to help the communities. What has received less attention is what these communities could have, should have, and did do to help themselves, both before and after. Amidst the tragedies are success stories, of lives saved, of communities coming together to help each other. There is an opportunity to learn from these communities and to apply those lessons to reach out in other communities, to enlist the communities and the people and organizations within them to be prepared at home and as part of their city or town, not just for their own sakes, but for the safety, security, and future of the communities they live in.
