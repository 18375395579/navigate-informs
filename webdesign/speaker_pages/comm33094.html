Title: Incentive Functions for Transportation Procurement Auctions<br>Author: Diwakar Gupta, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street S. E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, guptad@me.umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Justin Azadivar, Yibin Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: State Transportation Agencies (STAs) use variants of the first-price sealed-bid auction mechanism to realize low cost, high quality, and fast completion of highway and bridge construction projects. STAs pay incentives based on the realized value of an attribute of the work, which may or may not be of value, but bids do not explicitly include this attribute. We present models to identify cost-minimizing incentive functions for agencies, net of any benefits that may accrue from the attribute.
