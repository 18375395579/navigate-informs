Medaglia<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The main objective of the Interdependent Network Design Problem (INDP) is the efficient design of recovery strategies after a damaging event. In this work, we use the INDP to address the problem of reconstructing interconnected networks considering co-location and functional interdependencies. We also study the effects of using simplified surrogate networks on the quality and efficiency of the INDP solutions as a stepping stone towards better multi-system intervention decision support.
