<br>Title: Improving Agricultural Productivity: Impact of Minimum Support Prices</br><br>Author: Tharanga Rajapakshe, Assistant Professor, University of Florida, Warrington School of Business Administra, Gainesville, FL, 32606, United States of America, Tharanga.rajapakshe@warrington.ufl.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A Minimum Support Price (MSP) for an agricultural crop is a guaranteed price, regardless of volume, at which a governmental entity agrees to purchase the crop from farmers. This work is an effort to understand the influence of MSP on a homogenous farming community cultivating a single crop. We analyze the impact of production cost and yield uncertainty on the MSP. Our results explain the role of MSP in improving productivity and social utility.</br>
