Multifunctional teams have been assumed to function by virtue of their existence. Using a game theoretic approach we study the design-manufacturing interface in multifunctional teams. We demonstrate that the setup of decision rights in such teams may influence team functioning and more importantly project outcomes. We show how companies can design these rights to ensure project success.</br>
