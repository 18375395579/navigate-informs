Vertical Individualism Facilitates Creative Idea Generation<br>Author: Jack Goncalo, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, jag97@cornell.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recent research suggests that individualism facilitates creativity in groups. However, there are two types of individualism (1) vertical which promotes competition and (2) horizontal which promotes equality and no research to investigate whether one form of individualism stimulates greater creativity than the other. The results of an experiment show that VI facilitates the expression of creative ideas and that group creativity requires not just independence but also competition.
