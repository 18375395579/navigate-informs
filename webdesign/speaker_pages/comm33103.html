Hurstbourne Pkwy, Louisville, KY, 40223, United States, jemyers@ups.com<br>Coauthor(s): Keith Ware, Duane Hooper<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The Long Range Planning function base their plans off a projected volume growth rate for the entire country.  The VolRight tool was developed to help them distribute the projected volume growth across locations in accordance with historical trends while maintaining the national growth level.  The spreadsheet calls Perl scripts to accesss and summarize the historical data, and then produces a center to center volume file to be used for planning purposes.
