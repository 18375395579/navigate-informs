<br>Title: Test for Variation in Risk Attitude Predicted by a Multiattribute Generalization of Cumulative Prospect Theory</br><br>Author: John Miyamoto, Associate Professor, University of Washington, Dept. of Psychology, Box 351525, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, jmiyamot@u.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Perry</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Fundamental to cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is the distinction between gains and losses.  The value function is thought to be concave for gains and convex for losses, which accounts for the empirical finding that people are more risk averse in the domain of gains than in the domain of losses.  We point out that in domains with multiattributed outcomes, the straightforward generalization of this hypothesis (risk averse for gains, risk seeking for losses) implies that the degree of risk aversion on one attribute should vary as a function of the fixed level of a second attribute.  Specifically, CPT predicts that preferences for gambles among levels of Attribute 1 with Attribute 2 set at a constant desirable level should display greater aversion than preferences for these same gambles with Attribute 2 set at a constant undesirable level.  We will report experimental tests of this prediction.  These results have relevance to quality-adjusted life years (QALY) modeling where survival duration plays the role of Attribute 1, and health quality plays the role of Attribute 2.  One should expect greater risk aversion with respect to survival risks in poor health states than in good health states.  Our empirial results suggest that the predicted variations in risk attitude as a function of health state do not occur.</br>
