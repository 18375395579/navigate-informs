<br>Title: A Markov Model of Baseball: Applications to Two Sluggers</br><br>Author: Mark Pankin, President, MDP Associates LLC, 1018 N. Cleveland Street, Arlington, VA, 22201, United States, mdp@pankin.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The progress of an inning of baseball is a natural process for a Markov model. The author will discuss one he has developed that contains quite a few detailed facets of the game. One application is about the effects of the St. Louis Cardinals batting the pitcher eighth in the second half of the 1998 season in an attempt to help Mark McGwire set the new single season home run record. The second applies the model to determine when the Giant’s Barry Bonds in 2001-02 should be walked intentionally.</br>
