Title: Routing of Autonomous UAVs in Unmapped Environments<br>Author: Chase Murray, Auburn University, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Auburn, AL, United States of America, ccm0022@auburn.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly capable and affordable. In this talk, we detail how to easily modify a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) UAV to perform obstacle avoidance. We also describe algorithms that use real-time obstacle detection to enable autonomous flight in unmapped, GPS-denied regions (e.g., inside buildings or caves). Algorithm performance is demonstrated for the case of a single UAV. Challenges of extending this work to multiple UAVs are also discussed.
