The objective of our study will be to determine the demand (based on effects of the National Planning Scenarios (NPS)) and the supply (capabilities) of the CM response units from DoD and other early responders.   Our analysis will evaluate capability gaps or overmatch, where current and projected capabilities fail to meet or exceed projected NPS demands.
