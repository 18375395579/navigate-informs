Title: Impact of Replenishment Policies on the Value of Demand Information in a Serial Supply Chain<br>Author: Kevin Shang, Fuqua School of Busines, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States, khshang@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sean Zhou<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A supply chain includes material and information flows.

This paper addresses this issue by investigating how the value of demand information is affected by inventory replenishment practices, i.e., responsive and periodic replenishments.
