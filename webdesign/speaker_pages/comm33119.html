To correctly identify the value, we use a instrumental variable (IV) estimation strategy with a unique data that includes reviewer and movie level information. Using reviewers?social characteristics in an online social network as IV for online user ratings, we directly compare the effect to weekly advertising spending to quantify the monetary value of online user ratings.</br>
