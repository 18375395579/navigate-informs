Such sensor networks are prevalent in defense and intelligence-gathering applications. We first present network complexity measures with an interest of determining which characteristics make the network more vulnerable to congestion. We then attempt to study network topology design algorithms that produce relatively congestion free topologies. Results from empirical studies will be discussed.</br>
