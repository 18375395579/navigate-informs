Title: Complexity Measures and Congestion Issues in Wireless Sensor Networks<br>Author: Rakesh Nagi, Professor and Chair, University at Buffalo, 438 Bell Hall, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, nagi@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sumita Mishra, William Lawless, James Llinas, Frank Mufalli<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the topic of congestion in mobile ad hoc sensor networks in a bandwidth-limited environment. Such sensor networks are prevalent in defense and intelligence-gathering applications. We first present network complexity measures with an interest of determining which characteristics make the network more vulnerable to congestion. We then attempt to study network topology design algorithms that produce relatively congestion free topologies. Results from empirical studies will be discussed.
