<br>Title: Adaptive Architectures and Governance</br><br>Author: Peri Tarr, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, 19 Skyline Drive, Hawthorne, NY, 10510, United States of America, tarr@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Architectures represent the mapping of a problem domain into a software solution. As such, they are early indicators of degree of alignment between a business need and a proposed solution. Although every system has an identifiable architecture, substantial portions of architectures arise via emergence and adaptation over time. We present adaptive architectures, focusing on architectures from agile and open source projects and what they teach us about developing business-aligned architectures.</br>
