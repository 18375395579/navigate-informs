To understand the conditions under which employees are more likely to speak up about problems, we ran experiments using medication administration tasks for which we purposely created problems.  Nurse spoke up under two conditions: (1) to obtain materials if there was no other way to work around the issue and (2) when their role identity was primed to include improvement.</br>
