Title: Revisiting R0: The Basic Reproductive Number for Pandemic Influenza<br>Author: Richard Larson, MIT, E40-231, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, rclarson@MIT.EDU<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The basic reproductive number R0  is the mean number of new influenza infections created by a newly infected person in a population of all susceptible people.  We show that R0 is not a constant of nature as its value is determined largely by behavioral patterns.  R0 can be greater than 1.0 and, contrary to popular belief, the probability of an exponentially growing pandemic may be small.  Attempts to estimate R0 from data of previous pandemics are fraught with methodological complexities.
