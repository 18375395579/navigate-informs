Title: Surgery Scheduling and the Impact of Post-Anesthesia Care Unit Flow<br>Author: Maya Bam, University of Michigan, Industrial and Operations Engineering, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, mbam@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton, Mark Van Oyen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Efficient surgery scheduling is vital for hospitals due to the high cost associated with surgeries, as well as for patients since adverse events can occur because of long wait times or operating room (OR) boarding. Surgery scheduling in multiple ORs considering downstream resources like the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) has not been well studied. We present an optimization model that minimizes cost for the hospital while preventing blocking of the ORs due to overutilization of the PACU.
