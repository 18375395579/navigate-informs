<br>Title: Offshore Business Process Outsourcing</br><br>Author: Amiya Chakravarty, Philip McDonald Chair and Professor, Northeastern University, 214 Hayden Hall, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, 02115, United States, akc@neu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Options for ownership and operations of an offshore facility include the captive center, offshore-development center (ODC), and build-operate-transfer (BOT). We compare capacity strategies of ODC and BOT. Further, we study improvements in productivity, employing the principal/agent model. We are interested in managerial insights addressing the desirability of BOT over ODC, behavior of optimal prices and investments, and incentive compatibility.</br>
