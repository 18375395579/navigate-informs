Title: Heuristic Methods for Hazard Zone Determinations<br>Author: Ed Pohl, University of Arkansas, Department of Industrial Engineering, Fayetteville, AR, United States of America, epohl@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Manuel D. Rossetti<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: To better examine the use of optimization in emergency planning this research investigates the determination of hazard zones within a geographic area.  A hazard zone is an area corresponding to a worst-case evacuation scenario and is a potential vulnerability that should be addressed by risk mitigation strategies.  The research compares two heuristic approaches to determining hazard zones based on population and road connectivity within a spatial network.
