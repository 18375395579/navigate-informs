<br>Title: Optimization Heuristics for the Decentralized Coordination of Resources to Improve Border Security</br><br>Author: Hector Ortiz-Pena, CUBRC, Inc, 4455 Genesee St., Buffalo, NY, 14221, United States of America, hector.ortiz-pena@cubrc.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rakesh Nagi, Mark Karwan, Michael Hirsch, Moises Sudit</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Efficient coordination of limited and distributed resources gathering information about illegal activities has become critically important for a safe and secure border environment. We have developed a multi-perspective mathematical programming model to maximize information gain from resources performing surveillance. Disruption of communication between resources is minimized. Computational experiments are presented showing our performance evaluation of developed heuristics.</br>
