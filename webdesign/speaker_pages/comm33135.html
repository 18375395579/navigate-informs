Title: Optimal Pricing of Restaurant Reservations<br>Author: Jaelynn Oh, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America, jaelynn@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuanming Su<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a model of restaurant reservations. Walk-in customers wait in a queue, while reservation holders book in advance to avoid queueing but they may not show up.  We characterize optimal pricing decisions.  Our results highlight several levers that restaurants may use to reduce the number of no-shows.
