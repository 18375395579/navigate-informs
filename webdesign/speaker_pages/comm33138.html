This paper discusses a set of methodological tools and processes being developed to support this technology analysis and forecasting challenge.  Focusing on the creation of a flexible technology knowledge base, this paper will also discuss future trade-space and real-time decision support capabilities that may ultimately be linked to this knowledge base.
