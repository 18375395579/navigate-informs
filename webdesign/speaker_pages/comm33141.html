Title: Simulating Agent Behaviors in a Deregulated Electricity Market<br>Author: Zhi Zhou, Graduate Student, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th St., Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, zhouz@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wai Kin Chan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In a deregulated electricity market, market participants make their own decisions to maximize their profit. Their decisions are made competitively, cooperatively, or both. Meanwhile, the market administrator needs to design market rules to maintain efficiency and reliability. In this talk, we present an agent-based simulation model that includes a 30-bus transmission network and study the behaviors of generator agents under different market scenarios controlled by the market administrator agent.
