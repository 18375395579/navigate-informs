Title: Schematic Inertia: A Dynamic and Complexity Pespective on Sared Cognition<br>Author: Benjamin Herndon, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 W.

We articulate these dimensions and consider how they form, accrue and decay as team tasks and boundaries change over time.  Finally, we posit relationships between these dimensions and a team’s ability to realize performance synergy or dissonance on the task at hand.
