Box 413 NWQ B, Room 4450, Department of Economics, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States of America, grantle@uwm.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Most nonprofit organizations fundraise according to rules of thumb, making changes through intuition. While intuition provides creative ways to solicit donations, the ad hoc process makes it difficult to determine which aspects are most effective. We test numerous fundraisers designed to ask some potential donors in one way and ask others in a slightly different way. The results measure the effectiveness of fundraisers. We give specific examples and ideas for general implementation.</br>
