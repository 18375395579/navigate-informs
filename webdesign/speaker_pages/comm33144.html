Worldwide crowdfunding raised almost $2.7 billion in 2012 (crowdsroucing.org). Although there are several academic studies on crowdfunding, it is important to highlight the collective evaluation mechanisms of crowdfunding. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of social influence and network characteristics on the likelihood of funding success, using data collected from Kickstarter.com.</br>
