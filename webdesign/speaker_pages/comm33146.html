Title: Search for a Computationally Tractable Formulation for Contiguous Cave Formation<br>Author: Anita Parkinson, PhD Student, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, anita.parkinson@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): S. Thomas McCormick, Maurice Queyranne<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In planning the period-by-period development of a block cave mine, the most challenging constraint is that the open drawpoints form a contiguous cave. Since these mines and the resulting models are very large, finding an integral formulation is of great interest. In this paper we compare several formulations and other computational approaches on several sets of actual mine data.
