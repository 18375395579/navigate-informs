Title: Direct Marketing of Service Contracts under Autonomous Customer Dynamics<br>Author: Christoph Heitz, Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Postfach, Wintherthur, ZH, 8401, Switzerland, heit@zhaw.ch<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Service provicers often sell service contracts that are terminated by autonomous customer action. We study the cost/return problem of direct marketing campaigns in this context.      For an example from the telecom industry, it is shown that the optimum selection of customers must include not only the classical acceptance probability, but also the autonomous dynamics of this particular customer. By including these dynamics, the return-on-investment could be improved up to a factor 10.
