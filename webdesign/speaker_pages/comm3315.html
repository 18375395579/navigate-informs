Title: Generative Leadership Practices and Value Identification<br>Author: James Hazy, Visiting Professor, Malardalens University, Eskilstuna, Sweden, hazy@adelphi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tom Shinick<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The paper explores specific and differentiated leadership practices that lead to the identification of value creation opportunities. It argues that value identification places two functional demands on organizations which are enacted by leadership: information gathering enables situational awareness and generative activities create relevant information to be recognized and interpreted. A complexity-informed model of these functions is offered and preliminary empirical support is described.
