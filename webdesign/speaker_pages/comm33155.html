Title: Optimizing Kidney Exchange with Transplant Chains: Theory and Reality<br>Author: John Dickerson, Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Dept, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, dickerson@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tuomas Sandholm, Ariel Procaccia<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Chains, sequences of transplants initiated by an altruistic donor, have shown marked success in kidney exchanges. We prove that chains beyond length 3 do not help in the large. Yet our results from running the UNOS nationwide exchange show improvement with caps up to 13. We analyze reasons for this. We augment the standard model to include various real-world features. Experiments support the theory and help determine what is “in the large. In the dynamic setting, a cap of 4 is better than 5.
