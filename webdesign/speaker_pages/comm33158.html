Title: Search Before Tradeoffs are Known<br>Author: Otso Massala, INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Avenue, Singapore, Singapore, otso.massala@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ilia Tsetlin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a setting where the decision maker searches (with recall) for multiattribute alternatives but, while searching, does not know exactly his further tradeoffs (preference) among different attributes. After the search is completed, the decision maker learns his tradeoff's and selects the best alternative out of the discovered ones. We study the optimal search strategy in this and related settings.
