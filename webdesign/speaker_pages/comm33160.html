We're in the fortunate situation of knowing we'll be asked to create similar patient scheduling systems at multiple facilities performing hip/knee arthroplasty. Hence, our goal is to create a flexible 'OR toolkit' for efficient implementation across multiple sites. Lessons 'learned' and 'learning still' will be presented.</br>
