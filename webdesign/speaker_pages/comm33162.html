Title: Causes of Product Recall in the Automotive Industry: An Empirical Investigation<br>Author: Serguei Netessine, Professor, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, France, serguei.netessine@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rachna Shah, George Ball<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Negative impact of product recalls is well-documented.  On the other hand, little is know about systematic factors that cause recalls. By combining the recalls data with plant-level production data, we demonstrate that recalls are more likely to happen at plants operating under high utilization and high option variety.
