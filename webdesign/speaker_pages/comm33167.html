Title: Using Online Search Data to Forecast New Product Sales<br>Author: Gauri Kulkarni, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland, 3330H Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, United States of America, gkulkarn@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wendy Moe, P. K. Kannan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: It is reasonable to assume that people focus their online search engine searches on terms that are of interest to them.  As such, data on the search terms used can provide valuable indicators of consumer interest in a new product.  This can be particularly valuable to managers in search of tools to gauge potential interest in a new product launch.  We use pre-launch search activity as a measure of consumer interest and link search behavior to release-week sales for motion pictures.
