<br>Title: The Mirroring Hypothesis: Theory and Evidence</br><br>Author: Carliss Baldwin, Professor, Harvard Business School, Baker Library 355, Boston, MA, United States of America, cbaldwin@hbs.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lyra Colfer, Alan MacCormack, John Rusnak</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The “mirroring hypothesis?claims that the structure of a product development organization mirrors the architecture of the product it develops. This paper reviews the theory and empirical evidence with respect to the hypothesis. While there is much evidence in support of mirroring, there are also clear exceptions. In particular, the ability to understand and interact with the design itself appears to be a substitute for organizational structure.</br>
