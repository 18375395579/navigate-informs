Title: Does the Size of the ARM Matter?<br>Author: Marc McDill, Associate Professor, Pennsylvania State University, School of Forest Resources, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, mem14@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sandor Toth, Sandor Toth<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We explore the question of how factors like problem size, formulation type, characteristics of the forest, and side constraints affect solution times for spatially explicit area-restricted (ARM) forest planning problems.  Conclusions are based on a synthesis of the literature and an experiment using both hypothetical and real forest planning problems.
