This is due to stringent environmental legislation and the relative economic benefits of product take-back. Challenges of remanufacturing include the determination of quality, cost and warranty estimates all of which are dependent on product reliability estimates. We present a simulation model that maps product reliability considering components with varying age distributions and residual life.</br>
