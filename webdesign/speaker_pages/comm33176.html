Title: Green Recycling Networks<br>Author: Fang Tian, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, IOM Department, BRI 401, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-0809, United States of America, tianfang@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Greys Sosic, Laurens Debo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: By analyzing two important determinants of recycling costs, economies of scale and material-stream heterogeneity, we discuss the impact of Extended Producer Responsibility legislation on recycling coalitions. We study coalitions that emerge endogenously when producers manage recycling, compared with coalitions organized by governments to minimize recycling costs and coalitions to maximize social welfare. We conclude by discussing implications of social welfare when implementing taxes/subsidies.
