We integrate empirical research (from the Workforce Communication Program at Georgia Tech's H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering) with observations of business student analytical presentations to identify twelve presentation skills that can usefully be taught in the business school management science course.  The process of implementing these skills in business and engineering courses at several universities will be described.</br>
