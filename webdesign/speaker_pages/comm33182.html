Investment issues are central to market restructuring efforts globally and STEMS is unique in its ability to handle these decision processes. We first cover experience with simple adaptive agents competing in a pure spot market. Later we explore the ability of adaptive agents without tactical predispositions to develop efficient and successful multi-time-period strategies.
