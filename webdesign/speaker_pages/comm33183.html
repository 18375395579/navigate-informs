<br>Title: Biological Planning for High-dose Rate Brachytherapy: Application to Cervical Cancer Treatment</br><br>Author: Eva Lee, Professor and Director, Industrial and Systems Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, eva.lee@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alistair Templeton, Rui Yao, Jame CH Chu, Krystyna Liel, Fan Yuan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Cervical cancer is slow-growing and in early stages may not have any symptoms. Successful treatment remains challenging and the mortality rate in the U.S. is high at about 35%.   We describe novel biological treatment planning designs that incorporate functional PET information for targeted escalated dose delivery.  Our study reveals improvement both in local tumor control and organs-at-risk toxicity, two competing and desirable goals that were previously thought to be unachievable simultaneously.</br>
