Box 325, Eskilstuna, 63105, Sweden, tomas.backstrom@mdh.se<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Are there qualitative differences in the processes behind incremental and radical innovation? Incremental innovation is described as a process of emergence leading to continuously improving fitness of the system. Radical innovation is described as a punctuated development, where innovation maturity increases during the quiet times, to be used for jumps of fitness improvements when needed. But the increase of innovation maturity is a process of emergence.
