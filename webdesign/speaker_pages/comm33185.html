<br>Title: Big Data Analytics in Mobile Environments</br><br>Author: Hui Xiong, Associate Professor, Rutgers University, Rutgers Business School, 1 Washington Park, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, hxiong@rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Advances in sensor, wireless communication, and information have enabled us to collect and process big mobile data from multiple sources and time. In this talk, I discuss some emerging big data applications and the main technical challenges of big data analytics in mobile environments. In particularly, it is extremely important to investigate how the underlying computational models can be adapted for managing the uncertainties in relation to big data process in a huge nebulous environment.</br>
