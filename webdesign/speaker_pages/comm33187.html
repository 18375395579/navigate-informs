Title: Towards Lifelong Machine Learning<br>Author: Ashish Kapoor, Researcher, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052, United States of America, akapoor@microsoft.com<br>Coauthor(s): Eric Horvitz<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study principles of lifelong learning with following characteristics: continuous training over long periods, scarce informational resources and non-stationary environments. In such a system, the decision to extend a case library is made continuously by balancing cost of acquiring new information with benefit of increased predictive accuracy. The system adapts to underlying dynamics by caching and recalling information as context changes require. We review key concepts and real-world applications.
