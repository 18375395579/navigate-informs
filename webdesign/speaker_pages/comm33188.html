<br>Title: A Framework to Determine Out-of-service Costs for Avionics Upgrades</br><br>Author: Jonathan Drexler, Multi-Disciplinary System Engineer, CAASD/MITRE, 7515 Colshire Avenue, McLean, VA, 22102, United States, jdrexler@mitre.org</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Plans are in place to build a NextGen performance-based air traffic system. This presentation will cover a methodology that estimates the out-of-service cost per day for Part-121, On-Demand, and General Aviation operators. For each operator a list of potential aircraft strategies will be identified and their resulting costs will be identified.</br>
