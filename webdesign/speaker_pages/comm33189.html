<br>Title: The Value of Non-Definitive Experiments in Pure Science</br><br>Author: Erin Baker, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, 220 Elab, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, edbaker@ecs.umass.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Evaluating an experiment in the context of a decision problem is well understood. But this is not so well defined in a pure science situation, such as the goal of determining whether life ever existed on Mars. One can put a value on a definitive experiment, but many sequences of experiments result in probability distributions over the information of interest. We describe the difficulties in the situation, and propose methods for developing utility models over experiments.</br>
