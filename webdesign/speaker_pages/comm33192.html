<br>Title: Risk Attitudes for Means Objective</br><br>Author: Candice Huynh, University of California, Irvine, Paul Merage School of Business, Irvine, CA, 92697-3125, United States of America, candich@uci.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Simon</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study how communication about risk is often presented to people. We examine whether people are able to process and apply the information about a nonlinear relationship between a means and fundamental objective correctly. We find that people are equally likely to exhibit risk aversion in the domains of the means objective and fundamental objective, and thereby disregard the nonlinear relationship between the means and fundamental objective.</br>
