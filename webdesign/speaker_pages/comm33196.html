<br>Title: Revenue Management with Lifetime Value Considerations</br><br>Author: Anton Ovchinnikov, Darden School of Business, University of Virginia, 100 Darden Blvd, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States of America, Ovchinnikova@darden.virginia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Phil Pfeifer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We discuss the interaction between revenue management (RM) and customer relationship management (CRM) for a firm that operates in a customer retention situation but faces limited capacity. We present a dynamic programming model for how the firm balances investments in customer acquisition and retention, characterize the optimal policy and discuss how it changes depending on capacity limitations. We then contrast the modeling results with those of a behavioral experiment.</br>
