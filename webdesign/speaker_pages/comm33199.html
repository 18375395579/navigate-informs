<br>Title: Hazard Risk Assessment in Aviation : Methodology and Case Study Based on NTSB Accident/incident Data</br><br>Author: Eunhye Kim, KAIST, Guseong-dong, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of, color845@kaist.ac.kr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yoonjin Yoon</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Hazardous aviation accidents are usually infrequent but are potentially catastrophic, needing proactive control measures against hazards.  The guideline to perform adequate risk mitigation measures on these identified potential hazards comes from the hazard risk management, which can be quantified on the basis of historical data.  In this study, we propose a methodology for risk assessment and analyze the result using NTSB aviation accident/incident database.</br>
