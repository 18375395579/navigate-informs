Hart, Jean-Paul Watson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this presentation we highlight recent developments in the Coopr project, including new language constructs, support for differential-algebraic systems, and support for solver callbacks.  Coopr is an open-source umbrella project for supporting optimization within Python.  It includes the Pyomo modeling environment and several extensions, including support for stochastic programming (PySP), differential-algebraic systems (DAE), and disjunctive programming (GDP).
