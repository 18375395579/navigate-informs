Antonio Carlos, 6627.Pampulha., Belo Horizonte, MG, 31270-901, Brazil, lsantiago@ufmg.br<br>Coauthor(s): Henrique Mendes Silva<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of valuating a startup firm in the early stages of its creation under market, technology, and development time uncertainties. Our model takes into account the management value of the startup development process, and the opportunity created by those uncertainties. We analyze the impact of these uncertainties on the value of a startup and discuss the model’s practical implementation.
