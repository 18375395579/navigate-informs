Title: The Search for Indicators of Future Performance<br>Author: Jason Merrick, Virginia Commonwealth University, PO Box 843083, 1001 West Main Street, Richmond, 23284, United States of America, jrmerric@vcu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Organizations involved in safety-critical activities measure their performance using the number of problems or accidents that they have already experienced. We describe a framework for developing leading indicators of safety. We use Value Focused Thinking to understand the objectives that frame a particular decision context within an organization and to relate the objectives for different decision contexts. We test our approach with data from two Fortune 100 companies.
