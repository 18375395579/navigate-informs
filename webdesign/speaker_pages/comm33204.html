Title: Coordination with R&D Investments<br>Author: Christian Schade, Professor, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, Spandauer Str. 1, Berlin, DE, 10178, Germany, schade@wiwi.hu-berlin.de<br>Coauthor(s): Sabrina Boewe, Anna Kostanovskaya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The effects of technological spillovers, success probability, and investment cost on R&D investment decisions and coordination of individuals are investigated within the framework of the Interdependent Security Model (Kunreuther and Heal, 2005). We find that free-riding as well as investment risk explain more in variance of investment decisions than normative equilibrium predictions.
