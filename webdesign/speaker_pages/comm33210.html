<br>Title: Managing Integrated Main and Regional Carriers Recovery Decisions</br><br>Author: Julian Pachon, Principal O.R. Scientist, Navitaire, Inc., 9130 Jollyville Rd, Suite 100, Austin, TX, 78759, United States of America, Julian.Pachon@navitaire.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stuart Smith</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A common regional carrier model is to transport passengers who book directly with the main carrier.  Once a flight schedule is determined, all operational decisions are generally done independently.  Since disruptions to the schedule affect both the main and regional carriers, independent recovery decisions lead to sub-optimal solutions.   We discuss approaches that integrate both main and regional decisions.  We describe the integrated recovery problem and present its technological challenges.</br>
