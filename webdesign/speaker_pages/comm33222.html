<br>Title: Estimating the Cost of a Biomass Feedstock Supply Chain Using GIS Data</br><br>Author: T. Edward Yu, Asssistant Professor, University of Tennessee, Dept of Agri. & Resource Economics, Knoxville, TN, 37996-4518, United States of America, tyu1@utk.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zidong Wang, Burton English, James Larson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The cost of biomass feedstock supply is crucial to the development of a cellulosic biofuel industry. This study applies a geo-spatial optimization model to estimate the cost of biomass feedstock at the gate of a biorefinery in Tennessee.  Considering the road network and various GIS data, the preliminary results suggest that location conditions, such as the degree of feedstock draw area dispersion and the topography of draw area around the biorefinery, have important impacts on feedstock cost.</br>
