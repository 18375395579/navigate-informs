Title: Which is Better: Adding More Beds to Your ED or Reducing Inpatient Holding Times?<br>Author: Gilles Reinhardt, Associate Professor, DePaul University, Department of Management, Chicago, IL, 60604, United States, greinhar@condor.depaul.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Using simulations based on data from a busy academic ED we compare adding more beds to reducing inpatient holding times. We conclude that although increasing beds improves ED performance, speeding up inpatient admissions out of the ED is a more effective lever against all congestion effects (lenght-of-stay, leave-without-being-seen, overcrowding).
