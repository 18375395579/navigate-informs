<br>Title: Opportunistic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks</br><br>Author: Xin Liu, Assistant Professor, University of California, Davis, one shields ave., Davis, ca, 95616, United States of America, liu@cs.ucdavis.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Cognitive radio is a promising technology to mitigate spectrum  shortage in wireless communications. It enables secondary users to  opportunistically access low-occupancy primary spectral bands while  protecting the legacy primary users. In this talk, we present a  medium access scheme for secondary users that dynamically adapt their  transmission and sensing strategies to maximize their channel access  time while limiting collision with primary users.</br>
