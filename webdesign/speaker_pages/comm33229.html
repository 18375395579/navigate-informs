In this talk, we investigate the opportunities and challenges that will arise when trying to utilize the distributed multi-core architectures that have recently become pervasive to solve a single integer linear optimization problem. We raise the question whether best practices in sequential solution of ILPs will be effective in massively parallel environments.</br>
