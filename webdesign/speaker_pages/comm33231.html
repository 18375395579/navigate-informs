Title: An Empirical Analysis of Delay Propagations in the Airline Plans<br>Author: Shervin AhmadBeygi, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, Shervin@umich.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Passenger airline delays have received increasing attention over the past several years. In this presentation, we study the impact of delay propagation on the airline plans. We also show how the disruptive consequences of delay propagation can be reduced by redistributing existing slack in the planning process. The computational results based on data from a major U.S. carrier are presented to support the effectiveness of this approach.
