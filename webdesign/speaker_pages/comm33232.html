Title: Tradeoff between Speed and Quality in the Information Fusion Process for Cyber Security<br>Author: Moises Sudit, State University of New York at Buffalo, 307 Bell Hall (North Campus), Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, sudit@eng.buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Adam Stotz, Rakesh Nagi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: One of the hardest problems in Cyber Security is the speed in which sensor information needs to be fused to give decision-making systems or individuals a “real-time?situational awareness of their networks. This creates a clear tradeoff of quality of the status of potential threats and the time in which those situations are calculated. We present issues that arise in the fusion process in the Cyber Domain and a methodology addressing the tradeoff between speed and quality for network security.
