Title: A Comparison of MCUSUM-based and MEWMA-based Surveillance Methods in Non-homogeneous Population<br>Author: Sung Won Han, Fellow, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 340 Kingsland St., Nutley, NJ, United States of America, sung_won.han@roche.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by applications in healthcare surveillance, we studied the spatiotemporal surveillance problem of detecting the mean change of Poisson count data in non-homogeneous populations. We investigate several likelihood ratio-based approaches and EWMA-based methods and compare them under various scenarios. We discuss under which scenarios the EWMA-based methods are more robust than the likelihood ratio-based approaches.
