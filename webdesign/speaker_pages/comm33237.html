<br>Title: A Distributed Algorithm for Energy-efficient Data Center Operations</br><br>Author: Young Myoung Ko, Assistant Professor, Pohang University of Science and Technology, 77, Cheongam-ro, Nam-gu, Pohang, 790-784, Korea, Republic of, youngko@postech.ac.kr</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Rapid spread of mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets brings about increasing needs for large-scale data centers that process and store the data produced by mobile devices. However, several studies reveal that current data center operations are undesirably energy inefficient because all servers are running at their full capacity around the clock regardless of demand changes over time.  We propose a novel distributed algorithm that effectively reduces energy consumption of data centers.</br>
