Title: Dynamic Optimization of Threshold Risk Measures & Applications to Energy Markets<br>Author: Ricardo Collado, Post-Doctoral Associate, Princeton University, Dept. of Operations Res. & Financial Eng, Sherrerd Hall, Charlton Street, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, rcollado@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce a new family of risk measures suitable for applications  where the natural risk-averse model requires not to fall below a threshold. We call these threshold risk measures and it arise naturally in problems related to energy markets and hedging. Our presentation discuss the threshold risk measures in the context of dynamic programming and an application in the trading of energy  futures and spot contracts.
