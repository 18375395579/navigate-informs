Title: Tornado Outbreak Risk in the DHS Strategic National Risk Assessment (SNRA)<br>Author: Joel Piper, DHS PLCY/SPAR, 245 Murray Lane SW, Bldg. 410, Mail Stop: 0445, Washington, DC, 20016, United States of America, Joel.Piper@HQ.DHS.GOV<br>Coauthor(s): Merideth Secor<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The SNRA characterizes risks to the Nation (including terrorism and national disasters) to help guide national preparedness.  For tornado risk, the regional risk (multiple tornadoes spawned from a storm system) are more relevant to the Federal response than individual isolated events. For this situations, DHS has developed an algorithm that aggregates events based on distance and time separation to better inform a broad response to natural disasters.
