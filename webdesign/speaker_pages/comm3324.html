Title: Wine Futures and Advance Selling under Quality Uncertainty<br>Author: Tim Noparumpa, Assistant Professor of Management, Providence College, School of Business, 1 Cunningham Square, Providence, RI, 02918, United States of America, tnoparum@providence.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Burak Kazaz, Scott Webster<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this study we examine the use of wine futures and advance selling as a form of operational flexibility to mitigate quality rating risk in wine production. While aging in the barrel, expert reviewers create a barrel score, indicating the potential quality of the wine. Based on the barrel score, the wine producer determines what proportion of its wine should be sold as futures, and what proportion should be sold in retail.
