Title: Estimating the Robustness of Regulatory Networks Using McMC and Trust Regions<br>Author: Leo Lopes, University of Arizona, University of Arizona - SIE, Tucson, AZ, United States of America, leo@sie.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Konieczka, Parker Antin, Matej Boguszak<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We estimate the robustness of a cell regulatory network: the network's ability to produce a given phenotype when the parameters governing the relationships between the molecules vary. We exploit the fact that re-optimization is significantly cheaper than optimization by combining a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with Trust Region concepts.  We present our algorithm and the conditions under which the algorithm is better than the current state of the art.
