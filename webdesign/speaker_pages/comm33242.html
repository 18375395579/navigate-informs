<br>Title: The Impact of RFID on Stockouts at the Retail Level</br><br>Author: Matthew Waller, Associate Professor, University of Arkansas, WCOB 347 University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, mwaller@walton.uark.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Several major retailers have launched RFID initiatives with Wal-Mart leading the way. In an effort to explore the potential business case, Wal-Mart commissioned a study to examine the influence of RFID on out of stocks. Preliminary results presented in this paper suggest that RFID is making a difference: within the test stores, out of stocks were reduced; test stores outperformed control stores; and tagged items outperformed non-tagged items within test stores.</br>
