Title: Terminal Health and Solution Path<br>Author: Brian Blevins, Sr Manager Service Design, BNSF, 2600 Lou Menk Dr., Fort Worth, TX, 76131, United States of America, Brian.Blevins@BNSF.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Railroads are constantly struggled to identify where they are experiencing problems on their network. In an attempt to improve design efficiency I created a Terminal Health System that analyzes 3 dwell measurements and compares the current performance to historic percentiles. The struggling terminal is put on a list and emailed to our design staff on a daily basis. While this system is very basic, we have been able to track its ability to find issues and offer solutions.
