<br>Title: Generating Artificial Airline Schedules with a Genetic Algorithm Approach</br><br>Author: Zhengjie Zhang, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, zhengjie.zhang@boeing.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roger A Parker</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Using the measures discussed previously, and the computing systems built by BCA for network analysis, the creation of artificial airline schedules using genetic algorithm techniques is presented.  The aim is to produce airline schedules that mimic the evolution of the airline network so that its future structure can be studied.  Airline schedule generation both with and without the presence of competition are offered.  The effects of various fitness measures on the results are described.</br>
