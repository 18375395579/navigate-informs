Title: New Monte Carlo Methods for Identifying the Initial Transient<br>Author: Peter W. Glynn, Stanford University, glynn@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: One often wishes to compute the rate of convergence to equilibrium of a Markov process, either because of its modeling implications or its algorithmic implications (e.g. planning a steady-state simulation). In this talk, we introduce some new sampling-based methods for identifying the rate of convergence, and discuss some related convergence results. This work is joint with Jose Blanchet.
