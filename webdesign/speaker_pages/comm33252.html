Title: Social Networks and Adapting to IT-enabled Change: The Case of Healthcare Information Technologies<br>Author: Roopa Raman, PhD Candidate, Emory University, Goizueta Business School, 1300 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, United States of America, roopa_raman@bus.emory.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Adapting to changes introduced by healthcare information technologies in patient-care work processes is challenging. This makes assimilation of the technology difficult, as evidenced by disparity in the extent of adaptation to IT-enabled process changes among patient-care units within the same hospital. Using the principles and methods of social network analysis, I explore the relational factors underlying such inter-unit variations in adaptability to IT-enabled process change.
