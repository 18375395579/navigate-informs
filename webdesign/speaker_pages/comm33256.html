Service convergence is defined as the tendency of previously separate service offerings to evolve towards an integrated product. We analyzed the business strategy of a Thai hospital and identified service convergence as a result of the firm's quality improvement and innovation initiative. We discuss how the integration of medical services with hospitality services contributed to the hospital's success in the medical tourism industry.
