Title: Value of Vehicle-to-Grid Electricity Under a 100% Renewable Energy System<br>Author: Xiaoshan Peng, PhD student, Booth School of Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, x-peng@chicagobooth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erica Plambeck, Baris Ata, Elaine Hart<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The emerging plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have significant potential to support the penetrations of the renewable resources. We investigate the value of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) under a fossil-free system via a dynamic control model that incorporates the uncertainty of the wind and solar power to determine the optimal charge and discharge rates of the electric vehicles.
