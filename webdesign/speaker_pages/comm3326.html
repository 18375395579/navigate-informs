<br>Title: Impact of Predictability Improvements on Airline Scheduling Practices</br><br>Author: Amber Woodburn, Graduate Student, University of Pennsylvania, 2514 Bruce Ave, Glenside, PA, 19038, United States of America, amber.woodburn@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Megan Ryerson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Justification for airport capacity enhancements are often framed in terms of delay reductions, but improvements to predictability, or block time reliability, may also offer substantial benefit to the health of the aviation system. In a case study utilizing statistical methodologies, including cluster analysis and quantile regression, we identify how new runway infrastructure impacts the predictability of arriving flights, and, consequently, the variance in airline’s scheduled block time.</br>
