Title: The Dynamic Model of Ownership Heterogeneity and Corporate Social Responsibility<br>Author: Nai Hua Wu, Texas A&M University, 4221 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, nwu@mays.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David G. Sirmon<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Research in corporate social responsibility (CSR) has focused mainly on managerial discretion or stakeholders. We intend to fill the gap by addressing CSR from the corporate governance perspective, specifically, the effect of ownership heterogeneity. Based on multiple agency theory, we predict that dedicated institutional owners and family owners are positively related to CSR performance, whereas transient institutional owners have negative influence. Our initial results support our predictions.
