We present an approach to this class of regulatory problems, reflecting analytical and empirical methods grounded in behavioral decision research. We inform this approach with findings from interviews with adolescent females, concerning how their choices about contraception will be affected by FDA’s interpretation of drug licensing laws.</br>
