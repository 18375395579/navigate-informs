<br>Title: Efficient Distribution of Water between Head-reach and Tail-end Farms in Developing Countries</br><br>Author: Mili Mehrotra, University of Minnesota, 321 19th Ave South, Minneapolis, MN, United States of America, milim@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Milind Dawande, Srinagesh Gavirneni, Vijay Mookerjee</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In developing countries, inequity in surface water distribution to farms arises due to their relative physical locations: water for tail-end farms must pass via their head-reach counterparts. We propose two decentralized coordination schemes: rate-card and water-guarantee for efficient distribution.</br>
