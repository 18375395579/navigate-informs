Title: Turnover Times Between Surgeries Vary with Time of the Day<br>Author: David Strum, Associate Professor Anesthesiology, Queen's University, Department of Anesthesiology, KGH, 76 Stuart Street, Kingston, ON, K7L 2V7, Canada, dstrum1@cogeco.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Luis Vargas<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Surgical scheduling is complicated by variability inherent in the turnover times (TT) between surgeries.  We investigated TT with the goal to describe variability in TT and the associated factors that might be predicted, controlled, or altered to improve surgical scheduling.  Our results suggest TT are specific to time of the day and knowledge of the sources of variability in TT are important to improve surgical scheduling and reduce sub-optimal utilization of costly operating rooms.
