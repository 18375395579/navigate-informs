Title: How to Prepare for Pandemic Flu in a University<br>Author: Karima Nigmatulina, MIT, knigmatu@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Larson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: With their unique populations and functions, universities will face unusual challenges in the case of pandemic flu.  The first question that must be addressed is if and when to send their student body home.  This brings up the question of whether this is even possible. Other issues involve supporting the remaining student body on campus, and sustaining the vital functions of the university through this prolonged outage.  We present several case studies with a focus on the MIT plan.
