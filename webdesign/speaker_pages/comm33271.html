Title: Advances in Processing SQL Queries on Probabilistic Data<br>Author: Christopher Re, University of Washington, Computer Science Department, Seattle, WA, United States of America, chrisre@cs.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dan Suciu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A SQL query over a relational database returns a set of answers  (tuples), which in practice can be often be quite large: hundreds or  thousands of tuples.  When the relational data is probabilistic, then  the SQL system needs to compute for each answer tuple a probability.  This computation is expensive, because it requires running a Monte  Carlo simulation, and needs be repeated for each tuple in the answer.  This work presents two methods for speeding up the SQL processor.
