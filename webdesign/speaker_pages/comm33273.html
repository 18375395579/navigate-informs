<br>Title: Geographical Factors Deriving Deceased Donor Kidney Procurement Rates</br><br>Author: Mazhar Arikan, University of Kansas, School of Business, Lawrence, KS, United States of America, mazhar@ku.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rodney Parker, Baris Ata</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The deceased donor allocation system exists because of the severe shortage of available organs. Contrary to much of the current literature, we investigate the supply side. By using the donor registry data we show that the organ procurement rates vary significantly across different geographic areas and that the procurement rates are significantly correlated with the wait times. We build a structural model and conduct counterfactual analyses to understand the ways of increasing supply of organs.</br>
