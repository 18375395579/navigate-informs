Title: Simulating Pedestrian and Vehicle Evacuation at Large Events<br>Author: Zhuoyang Zhou, Research Assistant, Arizona State University, 699 S Mill Ave., TA/RA Mail Room, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, zhuoyang.zhou@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hong Zheng, Pitu Mirchandani, Ning Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Currently, most evacuation management studies focus on vehicular traffic where their departure curves are assumed to be some analytical functions. This research developed a simulation model that included pedestrian evacuation process along with a proposed parking strategy to improve the evacuation efficiency. Performance comparison shows improved clearance time to safe boundaries.
