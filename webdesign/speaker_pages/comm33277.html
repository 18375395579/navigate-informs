Box 3707 MC 21-33, Seatte, WA, 98124-2207, United States of America, roger.a.parker@boeing.com<br>Coauthor(s): Fred Ervin, Richard Lonsdale<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Several measures of the effectiveness and value of the world’s airline network are described.  These include measure of consumer surplus (the Network Value Index), measures of market share structure, including q-derivatives, the Herfindahl index, and entropy notions, and measures of hub and spoke concentration, such as spoke density.  These measures will be compared and contrasted, and evaluated as vehicles for in-depth studies of the world’s airline network.  Computing algorithms are outlined.
