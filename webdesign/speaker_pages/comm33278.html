Title: Operations Research and Network Science forming a Modern, Emerging Conception of Information<br>Author: David Arney, United States Military Academy, Department of Mathematics, West Point, United States of America, david.arney@usma.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kathryn Coronges<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Progress is being made in solving problems and understanding issues in our information-centric world to build systems and make  decisions. This progress comes from integrating modes of understanding (theory, application, and practice) and perception (data, information, intelligence, knowledge, and wisdom). Operations research and network science play a role. Our model focuses on these two disciplines for information problem solving and informatics.
