Title: How to Create Spreadsheets that are Almost Certainly Correct<br>Author: Max Henrion, Lumina Decision Systems, Inc., 26010 Highland Way, Los Gatos, CA, 95033, henrion@lumina.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Even the most careful auditing may not reveal all errors in a spreadsheet. Instead, we translate the spreadsheet into Analytica, fixing any errors (after confirming with authors). The result is two models giving identical results, and high (and appropriate) confidence that both the spreadsheet and Analytica model are correct.
