We track and analyze our actual no-show and service duration data, and have used results to drive changes in scheduling and service delivery practices.  We measure the effects and surveyed staff and consumers on their satisfaction with key changes. Results help inform other research by identifying scheduling factors that impact clinic performance.</br>
