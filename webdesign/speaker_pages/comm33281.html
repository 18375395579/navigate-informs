<br>Title: Hedging New Product Development Contests</br><br>Author: Edward Anderson, Associate Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business, 1 University Station, B6500, CBA 5.202, Austin, TX, 78712-0212, United States of America, Edward.Anderson@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Saurabh Bansal</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we develop an analytic model of a firm that employs a contest for a component of a new product development effort. The firm, however, may hedge this contest with a simultaneous internal NPD effort to protect against the case in which the best solution of the contest is of insufficient quality. We characterize the situations under which such hedging will occur as well as the potential benefits to be realized from a hedging strategy.</br>
