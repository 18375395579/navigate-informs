<br>Title: Humanitarian Logistics</br><br>Author: Ozlem Ergun, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, oergun@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pinar Keskinocak, Julie L. Swann</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The increase in natural and man-made disasters in the recent years has highlighted  challenging problems in humanitarian operations, in addition to major long-term  humanitarian development challenges. Humanitarian logistics plays an important  role in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from sudden-onset disasters and  addressing long-term development issues. The management of humanitarian logistics  operations involves many challenges such as conflicting objectives from multiple stakeholders,  coordination and collaboration, high uncertainty, and scarcity of resources. In  this tutorial, we provide an introduction to humanitarian logistics and its main application  areas while outlining current research trends and the major challenges faced in  the area today. We also present four decision aid tools addressing typical applications  of humanitarian logistics: network design for donated human breast milk delivery in  South Africa, port simulation and shipment scheduling for a large international agency,  demand estimation and emergency procurement for CARE, and post-disaster medical  response under accessibility issues. In presenting these decision aid tools, we aim to  underline the differences  in issues arising from sudden-onset disasters and long-term  development problems, various stages of the life cycle of disasters, and different decision levels, while also pointing to general aspects in modeling humanitarian logistics problems.</br>
