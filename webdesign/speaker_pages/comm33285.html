<br>Title: Reconceptualizing Electronic Mail Overload</br><br>Author: Cynthia (Cindy) King, Assistant Professor, Management Communication; Associate Director, Center for Defense Management Reform, Naval Postgraduate School, 555 Dyer Road, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, clking@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gail Fann Thomas</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this study, e-mail interactions from a government organization were closely analyzed. Drawing on the Sproull & Kiesler’s (1991) first and second order effects of communication technologies and Boden’s (1994) theory of lamination, results suggest three characteristics that contribute to e-mail overload: unstable and unchanging requests, pressure to respond, and delegation and shifting interactants.  We conclude that e-mail talk, as social interaction, may both create and affect overload.</br>
