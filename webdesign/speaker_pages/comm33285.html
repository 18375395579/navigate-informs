Drawing on the Sproull & Kiesler’s (1991) first and second order effects of communication technologies and Boden’s (1994) theory of lamination, results suggest three characteristics that contribute to e-mail overload: unstable and unchanging requests, pressure to respond, and delegation and shifting interactants.  We conclude that e-mail talk, as social interaction, may both create and affect overload.
