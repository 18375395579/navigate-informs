Based on analyzing the security and congestion in the face of strategic applicants, this paper is further studied in an imperfect and multi-stage screening game.  In series queueing network, the error screen probabilities are considered. We provide analytical optimal level of screening strategies for the approver and compare the discriminatory and non-discriminatory screening policies.
