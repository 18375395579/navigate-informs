Observational research has the advantage of practical realism but the disadvantage of difficulty controlling for confounding factors.  Contrived experiments allow control of confounding factors, but are often weak in terms of practical realism.  In our empirical research we used video technology to develop a more realistic contrived experiment, thus realizing advantages of both approaches.  Execution issues will be discussed.</br>
