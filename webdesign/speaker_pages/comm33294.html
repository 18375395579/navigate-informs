Title: Progressive Hedging Applied to Mixed-Integer and Non-Linear Stochastic Programs<br>Author: David Woodruff, University of California-Davis, Graduate School of Management, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, DLWoodruff@UCDavis.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this introduction, we provide a tutorial overview of Progressive Hedging (PH) from a computational perspective with an eye toward applications to mixed integer (MIP) and non-linear (NL) problems, including a brief survey of literature concerning applications. We also survey literature concerning algorithmic and tuning innovations to support the effective solution of MIP and NL using PH. We also describe the PySP open-source software that supports continuing research at many locations.
