Title: Carbon Tariff Effects in Settings with Technology Choice and Foreign Production Cost Advantage<br>Author: David Drake, Harvard Business School, Morgan Hall 425, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, ddrake@hbs.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Carbon tariffs have emerged as a possible mechanism to address carbon leakage concerns, imposing carbon costs on imports at the regulated region's border. I show that, when firms choose from discrete technologies and offshore facilities hold a production cost advantage, carbon leakage can result despite the implementation of a carbon tariff. However, when carbon leakage does occur under a carbon tariff, global emissions can decrease, which contrasts existing results and conventional wisdom.
