A standard set of workflows that enable consistent and patient centered processes for the delivery system and provide a consistent clinical experience for patients would lead to improved outcomes. A discrete event simulation model is developed to analyze the patient flow in the primary care processes with complex interactions among patients, care providers, and resources.</br>
