<br>Title: Service Innovation in Manufacturing</br><br>Author: John E. Ettlie, Professor, E. Phillip Saunders College of Business, Rochester Institute of Technology, 107 Lomb Memorial Drive,, Rochester, NY, 14623-5608, jettlie@saunders.rit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Rosenthal</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In spite of the dominance of the service sector in developed countries there is little applied research on service innovation.  In this longitudinal study of nine significant service innovations in seven manufacturing firms, persistence of the new service concept served as the dependent variable.  The new service offering survived for all nine cases, although in two cases the innovation was spun-off as a separate business. Emergent concepts attendant to successful service innovation were organizational philosophy,championship, and multifunctional strategy-making.</br>
