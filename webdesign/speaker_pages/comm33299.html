Its purpose is coordinating the releases of hydro basins along the year and allocating them to hydro reservoirs of each basin. Stochasticity is due to hydro inflows although fuel and electricity market prices and demand can also influence the operation. Non linear water head effects are considered. A realistic case study based in the Spanish electric system is presented.</br>
