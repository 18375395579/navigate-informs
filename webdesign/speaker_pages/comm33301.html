Title: Artifact-centric RACI Specification for Development Governance<br>Author: Murray Cantor, Distinguished Engineer, IBM, 209 Burgess Ave, Westwood, MA, 02090, United States of America, mcantor@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: I will present an artifact-centric approach to specifying roles, decision rights, and policies to support decision making across software and system development teams.  I show how the artifact-centric approach provide a clear advantages by allowing both explicit specification and auditability while providing better support for process evolution for novel projects and for replicating the success of open source development communities.
