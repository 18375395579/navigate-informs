Title: OR Challenges in the Evacuation of the Carless<br>Author: Mark Hickman, University of Arizona, Civil Engineering, PO Box 210072, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States of America, mhickman@email.arizona.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the evacuation needs of persons without access to personal vehicles during an emergency. Specifically, we consider the use of buses or vans to evacuate these persons. To support decision-making, we introduce various vehicle routing strategies, depending on the scale and scope of the evacuation. We illustrate these strategies with some examples, but emphasize that more practical challenges remain.
