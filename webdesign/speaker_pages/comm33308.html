Title: A Game-Theoretic Perspective on Dynamic Network Equilibrium<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas, Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Melson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Dynamic network equilibrium is much more complex than static equilibrium.  Equilibrium may not be unique, and may not even exist in pure strategies, which is significant for simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment.  This presentation discusses several small examples of these issues, and introduces a game-theoretic perspective which may be useful in resolving them.
