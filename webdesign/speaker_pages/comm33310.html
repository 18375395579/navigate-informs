<br>Title: Interactive Decision Support Systems for Better Railroad Planning</br><br>Author: Ravindra Ahuja, President &  CEO, Innovative Scheduling, GTEC, 2153 Hawthorne Road, Suite 128, Gainesville, FL, 32641, United States of America, ravi@InnovativeScheduling.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Service design teams at railroads create and maintain operating plans (blocking and train plans). But the actual execution may differ from the plan. In this presentation, we will give an overview and demonstration of a web-based, map-based interactive decision support system to analyze the actual execution from shipment, train, block, and terminal perspectives, compare with the plan, and perform root cause analysis of any variance.</br>
