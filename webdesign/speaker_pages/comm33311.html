Title: Diversity of Solutions: Methods and Applications<br>Author: Stefan Voss, University of Hamburg (IWI), Institute of Information Systems, Von-Melle-Park 5, Hamburg, DE, 20146, Germany, stefan.voss@uni-hamburg.de<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Greistorfer<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Recently considerable interest has been on finding solutions with good objective function values that are different from each other. Based on applications from telecommunications (e.g., 1+1 protection and fault tolerance in the SDH/WDM context), transportation (e.g., minimizing waiting time of transfer passengers) and evolutionary algorithms we illustrate the need for diverse solutions. Methods to determine them are based on MIP formulations as well as effective tabu search implementations.
