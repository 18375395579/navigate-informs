Title: Identifying Account Sharing Through Keystroke Dynamics Analysis<br>Author: Sungzoon Cho, Professor, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, zoon@snu.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Seong-Seob Hwang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: When online accounts are shared by users, the service provider suffers from lost revenue, membership under-estimation, and impaired customer understanding.  In this work, we propose a biometric based approach.  Whenever a user types a password for login, keystroke dynamics is measured and collected.  An optimal number of clusters is estimated and then the account is classified as shared if it is larger than 1. An experiment involving 25 passwords and 16 users results in 60% to 90% accuracy.
