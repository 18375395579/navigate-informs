Title: A Study of the Interplay Effect in Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy for Lung Tumors<br>Author: Gino Lim, Associate Professor, University of Houston, Department of Industrial Engineering, E206 Engineering Building 2, Houston, TX, 77204-4008, United States of America, ginolim@uh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laleh Kardar, Wenhua Cao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this study, the 4D dynamic dose was calculated by simulating the intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) delivery process along with the moving lung tumor target described by 4D CTs. Timestamps of switching irradiation fields, proton energies, scanning spots were linked to patient respiratory cycles. The impact of interplay effects for IMPT lung treatment plans was evaluated and new “repainting?schemes for mitigating the interplay effects was also explored.
