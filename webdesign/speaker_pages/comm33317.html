However, consumers are unable to provide informed choice decisions on unfamiliar technologies. Marketing managers have looked at how multi-media technological advancements can be utilized to develop a method for introducing consumers to these innovations. This method is known as information acceleration. This is an NSF sponsored project MUSES:Environmental Policy, Auto Design & Materials Flow.
