Title: The Templatized Metaheuristics Framework<br>Author: Jean-Paul Watson, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800, MS 1318, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1318, United States of America, jwatson@sandia.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Analysis capabilities are lacking in most widely available metaheuristic class libraries. We introduce the Templatized Metaheuristics Framework or TMF, to close this capabilities gap. TMF supports features such as text-based algorithm initialization, population of solution-attribute databases to facilitate behavioral queries, and numerous functions to observe and quantify metaheuristic algorithm behavior. Issues relating to open-source metaheuristic library adoption will also be discussed.
