Variations in interpretations exist among radiologists and practices. Our model, based on mammography descriptors and demographic factors, predicts the probability of cancer and performs significantly better than radiologists in discriminating malignant from benign lesions. It also identifies the important risk predictors of breast cancer.</br>
