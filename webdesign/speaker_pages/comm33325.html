Title: Teaching Set-based Modeling in the Introductory Linear Programming Course<br>Author: Leo Lopes, University of Arizona, University of Arizona - SIE, Tucson, AZ, United States of America, leo@sie.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Simge Kucukyavuz<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this talk, we analyze data acquired from incorporating set-based modeling into the introductory Linear Programming course in the Systems and Industrial Engineering curriculum. We document aspects of student's background that had to be strengthened, testing and teaching materials, and outcomes. We end with recommendations for faculty interested in taking this approach and for textbook authors.
