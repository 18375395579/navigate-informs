We consider two objectives to capture the notions of “efficiency?and “fairness?in an exchange solution. Our main contributions include (i) a structural analysis of the resulting bicriteria timeshare exchange problem and (ii) a polynomial-time, decentralized algorithm for “good?bicriteria solutions.
