Combining performance data of music albums with file sharing data, we assess the impact on survival of music albums on the charts and evaluate the specific impact of P2P sharing on an album’s survival on the charts. We find significantly reduced chart survival for most albums. We also find sharing does have a negative impact on low ranked albums, point to increased risk for all but the cream of the crop.</br>
