Bailey<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: 'Social distancing' implies policies aimed to reduce proximate contacts between healthy people and those who might be infected and contagious.  Examples include school closings, tele-commuting, isolation and quarantine. Mathematical reasoning and historical analyses of the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu and the more recent SARS demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing measures to reduce spread of flu infection.
