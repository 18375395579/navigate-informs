We focus on both the mean and the variance measure of service quality, and use a structural model to control for the endogeneity between the patient case volume and the service quality of hospitals.  We answer the following questions: (1) Is larger patient volume causing, or caused by, better operations quality? And (2) Are larger hospitals really better than smaller ones?</br>
