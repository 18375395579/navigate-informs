Road 43, Big Lake, MN, 55309, United States of America, Jan.Ruby@bnsf.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Northstar, a commuter rail operator in Minneapolis, has to plan and execute its schedule on an active freight corridor. Success involves development of a long term operating plan coordinated with BNSF, the freight operator, long before the service is launched. The parties must also maintain a close working relationship to facilitate regular service planning. This presentation will focus on how BNSF and Northstar have cooperated to develop and maintain a plan that meets the needs of everyone.
