<br>Title: Calibration of Deviation Measures in General Portfolio Theory</br><br>Author: Sergey Sarykalin, University of Florida, saryk@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): R. Tyrrell Rockafellar, Stanislav Uryasev</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We will make a connection between the portfolio theory with general deviation measures and the classical asset pricing theory by examination of CAPM-like relations. In particular, we derive discount factors, corresponding to the CAPM-like relations and consider the risk-neutral pricing form of CAPM-like relations. This will lead to a method of calibrating deviation measures from market data.</br>
