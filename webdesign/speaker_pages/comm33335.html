Title: The Effects of Temporal Distance on Attitudes Toward Ambiguity<br>Author: Ayse Onculer, INSEAD, INSEAD, Bd. de Constance,, 77305 Fontainebleau cedex, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, ayse.onculer@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Selcuk Onay, Dolchai La-Ornual<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Building on a recent paradigm which emphasizes the importance of the source of ambiguity, we distinguish between outcome vagueness and probability vagueness. Then, using Construal Level Theory, we predict that temporal distance would affect attitudes towards these two types of ambiguity in different ways. In a series of experiments we found that while temporal distance does not have any effect on attitudes toward probability vagueness, it affects attitudes toward outcome vagueness considerably.
