Title: Relieving Pressure: Optimizing Water Distribution Pressure Management at Valley of the Moon Water District<br>Author: Segev Wasserkrug, IBM Research, IBM Haifa Research Lab, Haifa University Campus, Mount Carmel, Haifa, 31905, Israel, Segevw@il.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Alexey Tsitkin, Alexander Zadorojniy<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Valley of the Moon Water District (VOMWD) faced the challenge of managing the pressure of water in their water distribution network, a task which requires simultaneous control of ten valves. We will present how, through application of a novel optimization solution, we enabled VOMWD to significantly improve its pressure management capabilities, resulting in a measured 16% reduction in new leaks/bursts. We will also describe in detail the algorithm and the intricacies of the solution application
