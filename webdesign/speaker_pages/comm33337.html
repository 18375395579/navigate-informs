Title: Improving Spatial Reuse Through Tuning Transmit Power and Data Rate in Multihop Wireless Networks<br>Author: Tae-Seok Kim, Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 201 N. Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, tskim@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Hou<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In wireless networks, one can increase spatial reuse by reducing transmit power or increasing carrier sense threshold.  However, by doing so, the SINR decreases (and the data rate sustained) as a result of smaller received signal or increased interference level. In this study, we quantify the trade-off between the increase in spatial reuse and the decrease in the data rate sustained and study the relation between transmit power and carrier sense threshold.
