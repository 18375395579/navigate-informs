Title: The Networks Don’t Lie:  Variations in Social Relationships as a Basis for Differentiating Self-employment, Business Ownership, and Various Types of Entrepreneurship<br>Author: Jason Greenberg, New York University, Stern School of Business, New York, NY, United States of America, jgreenbe@stern.nyu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper I provide a theoretical basis for distinguishing self-employment, business ownership, and various notions of entrepreneurship by describing the social relational characteristics of the individuals or teams engaged in them. The approach I take here builds on work by sociologist Harrison White concerning identity claims and networks, to wit: social actors can make identity claims that deviate significantly from their “true?identities. What they cannot fake, however, are their objective social ties. Thus, as the title of this paper suggests, “the networks don’t lie.?Observing an actor’s actual social connections reveals her identity.
