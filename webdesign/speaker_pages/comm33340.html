Title: A Markov Modulated Poisson Model for Software Reliability<br>Author: Joshua Landon, Institute for Integrating Statistics in Decision Sciences, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, 20052, jlandon@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Suleyman Ozekici, Refik Soyer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this paper we consider a latent Markov process governing the intensity rate of software failures. The latent process represents the behavior of the debugging operations over time and enables us to deal with imperfect debugging scenario. We develop the Bayesian inference for the model and introduce a method to infer the unknown dimension of the Markov process.
