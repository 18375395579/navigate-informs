<br>Title: Activity Rules for Ascending Price Combinatorial Auctions</br><br>Author: Pavithra Harsha, Student, MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Bldg E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, pavithra@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Parkes, Cynthia Barnhart</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Activity rules help in suppressing strategic behavior and achieving   theoretical efficiency bounds in real world scenarios such as the spectrum and the landing slot auctions. They ensure consistent straightforward bidding. We enhance the commonly used revealed preference activity rules (RPAR) to address quasi-linear and budget constrained bidders. We derive the activity rules in these two settings and provide computational discussion.</br>
