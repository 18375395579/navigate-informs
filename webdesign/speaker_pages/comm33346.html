Title: Design and Analysis of Diagnostic Service Centers<br>Author: Xiaofang Wang, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, xiaofanw@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo, Alan Scheller-Wolf, Stephen Smith<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: At nurse lines as well as many other service centers, diagnostic accuracy is a key performance measure in addition to customer waiting time. Since longer service entails higher accuracy but also more congestion, the manager must decide on the optimal service depth to guide a diagnostic process between an agent and customer. We model these diagnostic service centers, provide structural properties of the optimal solution and managerial insights.
