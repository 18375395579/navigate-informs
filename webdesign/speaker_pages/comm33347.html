The RM department  provides the sales data of Auto Train, a service  that allows passengers to bring their vehicles on the train. We analyze the demand structure from sales data and build a mathematical model to describe the sales process for Auto Train. We further develop an algorithm to calculate the optimal pricing strategy that yields the maximum revenue.
