In this paper, we study the potential use of two contingency strategies on top of the SL approach: Strategic Inventory (SI) and Dynamic Emergency Response (DER).  We provide sensitivity analysis and numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of these strategies and to derive managerial insights.</br>
