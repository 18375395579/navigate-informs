As of 2010 c-section was the most common major surgical procedure performed. This abdominal surgery is associated with increased neonatal and maternal risk. The decision to perform a c-section is complex and varies by patient. A Bayesian decision model is developed to identify optimal policies for a trial of labor as a function of labor progression measured by cervical dilation.
