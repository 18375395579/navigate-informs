Title: Technology Interdependence<br>Author: Diane Bailey, Assistant Professor, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, 428 Terman Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, diane.bailey@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jan Chong, Paul Leonardi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Organizational studies of interdependence typically focus on task interdependence while studies of workplace technology almost uniformly investigate a single tool.  We unite these literatures by considering how the full range of technologies employed by working engineers are interdependently linked in design flows.? How engineers either bridge or close gaps in the flow proves instrumental in engineers' work and figures strongly in how technology interdependence shapes their work practices.
