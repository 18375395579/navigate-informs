Title: Fire, Water and Owl: Multi-objective Forest Planning in the Deschutes National Forest, USA<br>Author: Sandor Toth, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, School of Environmental and Forest Scien, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, toths@uw.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Svetlana Kushch, Thomas Mafera, Leo Yanez, Robert Deal, Gregory Ettl<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a multi-objective optimization application in a municipal watershed in the Deschutes National Forest, where water quality, spotted owl habitat, and fire risk mitigation are all critical but competing services. For example, fuel treatments increase sediment in the short run, but in the long run the risk of wildfires will be lower and sedimentation will be less.
