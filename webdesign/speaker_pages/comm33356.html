Title: Anonymous Data Collection Protocols with Participation Constraints<br>Author: Robert Garfinkel, Professor, University of Connecticut, School of Business, Storrs, CT, 06029, United States, Rob.Garfinkel@business.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ram Gopal, Rajeev Kumar<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We develop flexible, cryptography-based anonymous data collection protocols that can collect data from individuals without the use of a trusted third party. The first achieves full anonymity with communication only among the individual responders. The second achieves the same goal with the addition of an untrusted server. We also propose schemes that allow an individual to query other’s confidential data in a distributed environment before deciding whether to participate.
