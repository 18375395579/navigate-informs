Title: What Foreclosed Homes Should a Municipality Purchase to Stabilize Vulnerable Neighborhoods?<br>Author: Michael Johnson, PhD, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Boston, 100 Morrissey Blvd., Dept of Public Policy and Public Affairs, Boston, MA, 02124, United States of America, michael.johnson@umb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Felicia Sullivan, David Turcotte<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The large increase in residential mortgage foreclosures has hurt homeowners, renters and communities. In response, government and nonprofits have considered purchasing such properties for resale to stabilize affected neighborhoods. However, there are few guidelines by which this might be done. We present multi-criteria and optimization-based decision models for property acquisition and demonstrate significant tradeoffs between ease of use and social impact through testing with practitioners.
