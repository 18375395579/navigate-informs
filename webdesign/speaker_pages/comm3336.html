Aguayo</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Brain neural activities interact with behaviors. We use two-way ANOVA to identify the significance of the impacts of two behavioral factors (motion direction and detouring for obstacle) and their interaction on the dependency among a neuronal ensemble in the dorsal premotor (PMd) area of a monkey during a reaching motion.</br>
