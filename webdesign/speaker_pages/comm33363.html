<br>Title: Where Do We Want OR to Go in Education and Vice Versa?</br><br>Author: John R. Birge, Jerry W. and Carol Lee Levin Professor, University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business, 5807 S. Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States, john.birge@chicagogsb.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: While academics still represent the largest group of operations researchers judged by INFORMS membership and meetings attendance, education remains ironically substantially untouched by OR. Perhaps not so coincidentally, OR education also remains relatively unchanged by recent developments in education. In this talk, I will discuss possible channels for OR both to have a greater role in education developments and to benefit more from innovations in education.</br>
