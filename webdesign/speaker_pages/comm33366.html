Title: A Bernoulli Process Model of HIV Transmission in MSM (Submitted for the 2006 Pierskalla Award)<br>Author: Daniel Faissol, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of ISyE, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, dfaissol@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Julie Swann, Paul Griffin, Thomas Gift<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Bathhouses and sex clubs were frequently implicated during the original HIV epidemic. Their role in HIV transmission is again a cause of concern as HIV incidence is back on the rise. We present an extension of the Bernoulli Process Model of HIV transmission to study the role that bathhouses and sex clubs play in the epidemic. We use data from the 1997 Urban Men’s Health Study as parameters for the model and discuss the effects of various policies regarding bathhouses.
