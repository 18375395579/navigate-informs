Title: Characteristics and Modeling of Organizational Networks: A Disaster Operations Case Study in the US<br>Author: John Coles, Ph.D. Student, University at Buffalo, 306 Sundridge Dr., Buffalo, NY, 14228, United States of America, jbcoles@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhuang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: After a disaster strikes, the need to provide effective and immediate relief forces a network of partnerships between agencies to develop. In this talk we look at two case studies of interagency partnership after disasters, and compare and contrast network behavior. Using data from interviews about the 2011 tornado in Joplin Missouri and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, we explore how some characteristics of interagency networks might be captured for use in modeling and simulation.
