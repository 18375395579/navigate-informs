Title: Data and Information Fusion for Bio-medical Design and Bio-manufacturing Processes<br>Author: Xiaofeng Qin, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, xqin2@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yuan-Shin Lee<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper presents methods of data analysis and information fusion in bio-medical design and bio-manufacturing processes improvement. Technical methods of data and information fusion and the new industrial engineering role in bio-medical design and bio-manufacturing systems development are discussed in this paper. In overview, this research investigates a method for transforming uncontrolled biological procedures into reproducible, controlled manufacturing processes.
