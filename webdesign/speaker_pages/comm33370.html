In this paper we construct two experiments to compare consumers?preferences for a good described by a single stimulus-response function. The results show that the AHP and the trade-offs made using the stimulus-response function are in agreement on how strongly consumers prefer the good. This provides support for the hypothesis that the AHP measures intensity of preferences.
