Title: Measuring the Performance of Professional Services with an Application of DEA to Financial Audits<br>Author: Paul Rouse, The University of Auckland, p.rouse@auckland.ac.nz<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Service/manufacturing distinctions are usually recognised but distinctions within service organisations can be drawn between those that bundle service with a product, to those that provide services only, e.g. professional services. Using a modified production model and DEA (standard and network), we find client and audit branch characteristics affect performance of audits provided within a single auditing firm. From this we provide insights towards better modelling professional services.
