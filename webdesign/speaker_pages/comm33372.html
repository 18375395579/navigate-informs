Title: Argument Supremum of Subordinated Gaussian Processes with Negative Drift<br>Author: Yuxing Luo, PhD Student, Washington State University, Dept of Finance & Management Science, Pullman, WA, 99164-4746, United States of America, yluo@wsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stergios Fotopoulos<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The aim of this article is to develop a theory concerning the argument supremum of subordinated Gaussian processes. This includes obtaining exact Laplace transform of the argument supremum, its density and its stochastic representation. Theoretical results for the general case have been investigated for some of the well-known subordinators. The Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard model, which has received much attention in the recent financial literature, is the central motivation for this article.
