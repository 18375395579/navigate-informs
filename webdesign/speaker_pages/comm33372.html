This includes obtaining exact Laplace transform of the argument supremum, its density and its stochastic representation. Theoretical results for the general case have been investigated for some of the well-known subordinators. The Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard model, which has received much attention in the recent financial literature, is the central motivation for this article.</br>
