Title: Managing Co-Development Processes<br>Author: Stylianos Kavadias, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States, Stylianos.Kavadias@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sanjiv Erat<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Recently, Delta Airlines collaborated with 3M to develop a flame-resistant paper that could potentially be licensed to airline carriers. The study considers settings where two companies collaborate to develop a new product/technology. Our results suggest that NPD variables such as performance and cost uncertainty have important implications to when the revenue sharing contracts should be signed (i.e., before, during, or after the project).
