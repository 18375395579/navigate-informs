Title: Spatiotemporal Analysis of Physical Crime Patterns<br>Author: Uwe Glässer, Associate Professor and Director, Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada, glaesser@cs.sfu.ca<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Criminal events are understood in the context of complex interactions  between the most important elements of crime, namely: the law, the offender, the target and the place. We outline here a computational framework capturing these elements in abstract mathematical terms as required for analyzing multi-dimensional aspects of crime patterns by means of computational methods and tools.
