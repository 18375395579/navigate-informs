In our context, insurance and futures contracts are available to hedge against yield and price risks, respectively. In a study based on actual data, we derive efficient frontiers for each of the three ENSO phases (Neutral, La Niña, El Niño) and  highlight the contrast between their related hedging strategies.</br>
