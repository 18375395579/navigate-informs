Title: Web Interface for AS/RS Design Conceptualization<br>Author: Cai Xiao, Graduate student, University of Louisville, JB Speed Building, Department of Industrial Engineering, Louisville, KY, 40292, United States, x0cai001@louisville.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A platform of conceptualization tools for the design of Autonomous Vehicle Storage and Retrieval Systems (AVSRS) and Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS) has been developed.   For each design entered by a system designer, the software provides approximate estimates and key performance measures, thus allowing a comaprison of alternate design configurations.
