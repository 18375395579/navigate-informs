Data gathering in five major hospitals revealed typical lengths of stay of nearly 5 hours.  Waiting for an inpatient bed ?for those patients admitted through the ED ?took 211 minutes.  Specialist consult waits took 112 minutes.  Using these findings and such tools as simulation modeling, quality improvement science and lean system analysis, we are working with health care professionals to alleviate flow problems.</br>
