<br>Title: On the Carry-over Effect</br><br>Author: Dries Goossens, Ghent University, Belgium, Dries.Goossens@kuleuven.be</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Any schedule for a round robin tournament involves an order in which each team (or player) meets its opponents. If some team X plays against team A and subsequently against team B, we say that team B receives a carry-over effect to team A. Indeed, it is conceivable that team A affects team B’s result against X through e.g. fatigue, injury, or morale. We discuss how these effects can be balanced, and to what extent they have a real influence in soccer and tennis.</br>
