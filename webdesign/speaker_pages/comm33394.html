Title: An Innovative Tool to Monitor, Predict and Optimize Effectiveness of Advertising Campaigns<br>Author: Marc Fischer, University of Cologne, Germany<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Wachter, Christian Rumler<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Two factors drive the effectiveness of an advertising campaign: (1) the budget level and its allocation across media and (2) the quality of the campaign and its execution. Analytical approaches that enable management to monitor, predict, and optimize campaigns are rarely available. We offer an innovative approach that is based on survey data. The tool uses analytical techniques that are descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. It has been implemented at Mercedes-Benz and was applied to four recent major ad campaigns. Mercedes-Benz significantly improved its campaign management over time and identified a savings potential of up to EUR 2 million by campaign.
