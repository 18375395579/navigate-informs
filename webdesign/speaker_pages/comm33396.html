Title: Logistics Composite Model Variance Reduction<br>Author: Alan Johnson, Session Chair, Air Force Institute of Technology, AFIT/ENS, 2950 Hobson Way, Building 641, W-P AFB, OH, 45433-7765, United States, alan.johnson@afit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): George Cole<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The Air Force uses the Logistics Composite Model (LCOM) to determine aircraft maintenance manpower levels.  We are investigating the extent to which variance reduction techniques can be successfully applied to this discrete event simulation, in the hope of improving the performance of existing LCOM optimizers.  We discuss our progress and plans.
