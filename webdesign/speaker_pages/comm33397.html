Title: The Mathematics of Happiness<br>Author: Manel Baucells, mbaucells@iese.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose three nested modifications of the discounted utility model to capture how a flow of consumption is translated into a flow of happiness. The first incorporates habit formation and addresses the trade-off between adaptive and non-adaptive goods. The second incorporates satiation and addresses the trade-off between maintaining habits and seeking variety. The third incorporates the consumption of goods that yield meaning and purpose.
