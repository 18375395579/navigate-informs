The challenge is to develop/evaluate protocols to quantify these datasets, e.g., characterization of individuals and colocalization of features under distinct imaging modalities. This talk will describe work in quantitative image analysis, including description of microstructure of materials and biomedical images (ophthalmologic and neurological data)</br>
