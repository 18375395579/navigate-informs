<br>Title: Discriminants and Risk Scores in Logical Analysis of Data (LAD)</br><br>Author: Tibérius Bonates, Teaching Assistant, Rutgers University - RUTCOR, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854-800, United States, tbonates@rutcor.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter L. Hammer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean discriminants represented as weighted sums of LAD patterns are constructed by column generation and shown to accurately separate positive and negative observations. A discriminant-based risk index allows efficient risk stratification, being highly correlated with the probability of adverse events. Applications are presented in medical prognosis and financial risk assessment.</br>
