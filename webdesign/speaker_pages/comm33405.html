That is a shame, as they are a rich source of data about the process of preference modelling & facilitating groups with MCDA. In this paper I suggest that Action-Research provides an adequate framework for researching such processes and could be employed as a tool for learning systematically about them, in order to improve the MCDA practice.</br>
