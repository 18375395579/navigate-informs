Title: A Multiscale Paradigm Combining Individual-based Modeling and System Dynamics to Design Policy Options for Obesity<br>Author: Özge Karanfil, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, karanfil@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dean Hartley, Theresa Brown, Aldo Zagonel, Thomas Moore, Mihalis Golias<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a multi-model paradigm integrating a community-scale individual-based model (IBM) to investigate the immediate effects of interventions with a population-scale system dynamics (SD) model to analyze long term results of those interventions. The IBM incorporates actors embedded in a social network to simulate the spread of opinions relating to nutrition and physical activity behaviors, and the effects of these opinions on individuals. We analyze and compare effects of possible policy interventions and illustrate a policy cocktail to address multiple aspects of obesity.
