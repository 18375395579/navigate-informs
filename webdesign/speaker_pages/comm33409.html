<br>Title: Provision of Services and Information to the Tax Payer</br><br>Author: Kathleen Carley, Professor, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, 1323 Wean Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, United States of America, kathleen.carley@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Patricia McGuire</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Service related resource and operational decisions are often made by taking a regional approach or by doing a minor variation on what was done in the past.  Making these resource and operational decisions is exceeding difficult due to the complexity of the situation and the limitations of available data.  We explore how computational reasoning can be used to support this process.</br>
