The HC system is modelled as a system of parallel (heterogeneous) queues. Many different mapping heuristics have been proposed in recent years. We discuss modifications to policies from the flexible server queueing literature and discuss tradeoffs in performance (including guarantees) versus implementation concerns.</br>
