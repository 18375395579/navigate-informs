<br>Title: Delivering Preventive Mental Healthcare Services ?A Service Engineering Perspective</br><br>Author: Vittal Prabhu, Associate Professor, Penn State University, 348 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, prabhu@engr.psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vamsi Salaka, Meg Small, Celene Domitrovich</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This talk presents our recent experience in delivering preventive mental healthcare services in K12 schools in Harrisburg and Baltimore. Service engineering issues we cover include process modeling to characterize the capacity and cost of implementation; program implementation and evaluation for overall effectiveness; technology for providing access to information in real-time. We illustrate similarities between such preventive healthcare processes and manufacturing quality processes.</br>
