Title: The Effects of Diversification on the Evaluations of Ambiguous Investment Decisions<br>Author: Dolchai La-ornual, Ph.D. Candidate, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau Cedex, 77305, France, Dolchai.LA-ORNUAL@insead.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate whether individuals benefit from diversification when decisions are ambiguous and how this benefit compares to that when decisions are risky. We examine predictions based on conventional models of decision-making under ambiguity. Experimental results suggest that individuals derive less benefit from diversification when decisions involve ambiguity than when they involve risk. There also seems to be no perceived benefit in diversifying investments under pure uncertainty.
