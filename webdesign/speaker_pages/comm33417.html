However, only about half of these modifications manage to reduce cost of inventory-holding and lost-sales. With data from a European retailer, we examine the drivers, characteristics and impacts of manager behavior in order modification, and propose decision rules that regulate manager behavior and enhance managers' effectiveness.</br>
