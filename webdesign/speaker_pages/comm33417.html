Title: Modifying Replenishment Order Recommendations: Drivers, Characteristics, and Impacts<br>Author: Bo Li, Doctoral Student, Texas A&M University, 320M Wehner Bldg, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, bli@mays.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rogelio Oliva<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Store managers may modify order recommendations generated by the automatic replenishment system and achieve, on average, considerable savings. However, only about half of these modifications manage to reduce cost of inventory-holding and lost-sales. With data from a European retailer, we examine the drivers, characteristics and impacts of manager behavior in order modification, and propose decision rules that regulate manager behavior and enhance managers' effectiveness.
