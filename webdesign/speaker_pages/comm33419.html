Title: Manipulation Robustness of Collaborative Filtering Systems<br>Author: Xiang Yan, Stanford University, xyan@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Van Roy<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Rampant manipulation of collaborative filtering systems is suspected but their effects have received little formal analysis. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian framework to study the relationship between the actions of manipulators with hidden objectives and the resultant decrease in average recommendation quality. Our analysis sheds light on the robustness to gaming that a well-designed collaborative filtering system should exhibit and offers guidance to real system implementation.
