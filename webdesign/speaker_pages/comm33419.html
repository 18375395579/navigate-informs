In this paper, we propose a Bayesian framework to study the relationship between the actions of manipulators with hidden objectives and the resultant decrease in average recommendation quality. Our analysis sheds light on the robustness to gaming that a well-designed collaborative filtering system should exhibit and offers guidance to real system implementation.</br>
