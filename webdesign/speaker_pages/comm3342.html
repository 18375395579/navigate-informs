Title: Capacity Allocation between Appointments and Walk-ins with Endogenous Patient Choice<br>Author: Aditya Jain, Indian School of Business, AC 4, 4117, ISB Campus, Hyderabad, India, Aditya_Jain@isb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sarang Deo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a healthcare system, wherein each patient decides the mode of arrival (appointment vs. walk-in) depending on the resulting waiting times (indirect vs. direct) as well as the severity of patient's condition. The healthcare provider decides the allocation of capacity between walk-in and appointment slots. We analyze the equilibrium of this game and derive managerial insights about the impact of patient characteristics on capacity allocation decisions.
