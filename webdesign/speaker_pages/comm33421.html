Title: Relative Technological Discontinuities: Insights from the Identification of Shifts in Innovation<br>Author: Miguel Campo-Rambado, Dartmouth University, miguel.a.campo-rembado@dartmouth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): A.H. Taylor<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper, we conceptualize change in technological innovation as a continuous process where discontinuities are periods of greater change relative to other periods. Periods of high relative discontinuities are captured by identifying the unexpected, or residual, component in the trajectory of new innovative activity. Using our definition of relative discontinuities, we conduct cross-industry longitudinal analyses of technological innovation. Overall, we find that discontinuities are associated with tipping points in which the production of knowledge by organizations becomes self-reinforcing (e.g., new knowledge is produced that facilitates the production of more new knowledge). Firms accelerate their knowledge production during technological discontinuities and decelerate after. During discontinuities, firms use newer knowledge sources that, surprisingly, reinforce the existing knowledge trajectory. The results suggest that the accumulated effort of active innovators is what drives discontinuities.
