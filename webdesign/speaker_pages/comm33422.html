We use 10 years of data from 71 surgeons using a new cardiac surgery technology. We find that individuals learn more from their own successes than from their own failures, while they learn more from the failures of others than they do from others?successes. We also find that individuals?prior successes and others?failures help individuals overcome their inability to learn from their own failures.</br>
