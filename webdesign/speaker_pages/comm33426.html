Favorites and Biases in College Football</br><br>Author: Eric Huggins, Associate Professor of Management, Fort Lewis College, 1000 Rim Drive, Durango, CO, 81301, United States of America, huggins_e@fortlewis.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Sports fans have teams that they love and teams that they love to hate.  In NCAA football, fans have strong feelings about a handful of teams. Interestingly, most college football fans can watch any game and easily determine a favorite (in the sense of which team that they want to win, not which team is more likely to win.)  The choice of a favorite is complex, and we develop a theoretical framework for how fans make this choice and then test the framework against empirical data.</br>
