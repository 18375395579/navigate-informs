Title: Do Auctioneers Pick Optimal Reserve Prices? Theory and Evidence<br>Author: Elena Katok, Associate Professor, Penn State University, 465 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, ekatok@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anthony Kwasnica, Andrew Davis<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate how auctioneers set reserve prices in second-price auctions. Previous research has proven that the optimal reserve price is independent of the number of buyers.  We extend this proof to include certain risk averse preferences and also provide evidence that these results fail to exist through an experimental investigation.
