<br>Title: Applications of Outpatient Visit and Referral Forecasting</br><br>Author: John Osborn, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Centerplace 6, Rochester, MN, 55905, United States, osborn.john@mayo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ritesh Banerjee, Melissa Gregg, Brian Denton, Molly Destro-Borgen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Access to outpatient services is a key component of a successful healthcare system.  With improved decision support, providers could better allocate scarce capacity to meet patient demand.  Practice managers at a large, multi-specialty academic medical center must trade-off between appointment access for internally and externally referred patients.  This paper describes models developed to forecast internal referral volume, and to optimize the mix of internal and external patient access.</br>
