With improved decision support, providers could better allocate scarce capacity to meet patient demand.  Practice managers at a large, multi-specialty academic medical center must trade-off between appointment access for internally and externally referred patients.  This paper describes models developed to forecast internal referral volume, and to optimize the mix of internal and external patient access.
