<br>Title: House Allocation with Fractional Endowments</br><br>Author: Stergios Athanassoglou, Ph.D Student, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States, sa2164@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Sethuraman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine a generalized version of the house allocation problem in economics, allowing for arbitrary fractional endowments of houses to agents. In this context, we provide an efficient network flow based algorithm that computes an allocation satifying ordinal efficiency, individual rationality and no justified envy. We further discuss impossibility results related to strategyproofness and the core of the associated cooperative game.</br>
