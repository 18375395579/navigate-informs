Title: Decision Making Under Uncertainty: Representational and Psychometric Measures<br>Author: John Aloysius, University of Arkansas, 204 WCOB, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, JAloysius@walton.uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivasan Venkatraman, Fred Davis<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Decision analysis has normative foundations, but understanding linkages with descriptive information processing is key to develop prescriptive recommendations. Our experiment varies the number of plays and parameters of binary gambles. We analyze the relationships between abstract properties (e.g., expected value), psychological perceptions (riskiness and ambiguity) of these multiple prospects, decision behavior (e.g., certainty equivalents) and individual differences (e.g., risk attitude).
