Title: CSDP: Open Source Software for Semidefinite Programming<br>Author: Brian Borchers, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Department of Mathematics, 801 Leroy Place, Socorro, NM, 87801, United States, borchers@nmt.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: CSDP is a software package for semidefinite programming that implements a primal-dual interior point method.  The software is  available as an open source project through COIN-OR. CSDP has been ported to many different operating systems and hardware architectures.  This talk will highlight recent improvements to CSDP including parallelization on shared memory parallel architectures.
