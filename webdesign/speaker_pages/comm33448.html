<br>Title: Modeling Obesity from the Population Perspective</br><br>Author: Y. Claire Wang, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, 600 W 168th St 6th Fl, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America, ycw2102@columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Obesity is a major contributor to the health care cost challenges we confront today in the United States and abroad. Currently, one in three U.S. adults and 17% of children and teens are obese. There are also significant race-ethnic and income disparities. I will provide an overview on the current and emerging research opportunities to apply systems science and simulation methods to understand causes and consequences and to evaluate strategies and solutions.</br>
