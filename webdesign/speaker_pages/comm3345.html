Cofco Center Crt. #1209, Phoenix, AZ, 85008, United States of America, Mark.Keith@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haluk Demirkan, Michael Goul<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Informal knowledge sharing is one of the critical factors to the success of service-oriented software development environments. However, little is known about how and why informal knowledge sharing relationships form in project-based environments. Using a social network analysis, this study seeks to understand how the structure of informal knowledge sharing networks form as the result of individual knowledge, transactive memory, group structure, and task environment characteristics.
