Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, kvlachou@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Lovell, Michael Ball</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this research we define new flight predictability metrics which will provide a customer centric measurement of system performance. We investigate how airlines set their scheduled block times. We also analyze the benefit of improved flight predictability for the NAS and Identify how NextGen may lead to improved predictability.</br>
