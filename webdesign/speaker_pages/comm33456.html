Title: Generating Interest in OR among Undergraduate Mathematics Majors<br>Author: Kevin Hutson, Furman University, Greenville, SC, United States of America, kevin.hutson@furman.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Undergraduate mathematics students sometime get frustrated by an abstract major and long to use their mathematical skills in some applied setting.  Often, though, the mathematics major allows for a very limited coverage of OR concepts.  Here I talk about introducing OR to students in a variety of courses and through undergraduate research.  I will discuss success stories of projects as well as finding appropriate projects for these undergraduate students.
