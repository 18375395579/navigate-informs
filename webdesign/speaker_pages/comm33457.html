Title: Design of Scale-up Engineering Experiments<br>Author: Qiang Huang, Associate Professor, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Ave, GER 240, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, qiang.huang@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Li Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Engineering processes often are scale-dependent. They likely behave differently on a smaller scale in a laboratory than on a larger scale in full production. We propose a strategy to explore the similarity space in order to identify suitable regions for system scale-up. The strategy is demonstrated with the study of drag on a sphere in fluid. Applications can be extended to scale-up nanomanufacturing.
