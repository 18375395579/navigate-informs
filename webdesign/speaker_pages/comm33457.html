They likely behave differently on a smaller scale in a laboratory than on a larger scale in full production. We propose a strategy to explore the similarity space in order to identify suitable regions for system scale-up. The strategy is demonstrated with the study of drag on a sphere in fluid. Applications can be extended to scale-up nanomanufacturing.</br>
