Title: ZIMPL: A Solver Independend Open Source Modelling Language<br>Author: Thorsten Koch, Senior Scientist, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin, Takustraße 7, 14195 Berlin-Dahlem, Germany, koch@zib.de<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: ZIMPL is a freely available open source algebraic modelling language for describing linear mixed integer programs. It is very portable and can be used either standalone, embedded into an application, or linked to a solver. We will give an overview of the language itself and its interfaces, mention unique features, discuss recent and planned   enhancements, and report experiences made when using ZIMPL in courses and industry projects.
