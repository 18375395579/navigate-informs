<br>Title: Conservation or Diversification? The Role of Organizational Slack in Young Firms and Mature Business</br><br>Author: Nitin Joglekar, Boston University, Boston, MA, United States of America, joglekar@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jane Davies</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research compares the role of organizational slack in young firms and mature businesses. It hypothesizes that the management of organizational slack differs between young and established firms, and specifically considers the effect of the conservation of cash at differing stages of the firm’s lifecycle on financial performance. Our findings link organizational slack with alternative strategies for managing flexibility, R&D and operational efficiency.</br>
