Title: Estimating the Endogenous Power Curve for Wind Turbines<br>Author: Yu Ding, Professor, Texas A&M University, TAMU 3131, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, yuding@iemail.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Giwhyun Lee, Marc Genton, Le Xie<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Power curves can be used for characterizing energy production efficiency of a wind turbine.  Using the raw power data, however, cannot accurately reflect the changes in a turbine because besides the wind speed, many ambient factors potentially affect the power output of a turbine. This talk presents our recent work on estimating the endogenous power curve, the curve decided by a turbine’s own aerodynamics, after the influence from the ambient factors is controlled for.
