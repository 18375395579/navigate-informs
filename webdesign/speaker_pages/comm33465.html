Title: Gain-loss Framing, Near Misses, and Cyber Security<br>Author: Richard John, Associate Professor of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, richardj@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Heather Rosoff<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Cyber security depends on user decision making under uncertainty. We describe the role of near misses on cyber security decision making and a model of such decisions that accounts for the reference point used by the decision maker. We report behavioral lab studies that characterize the role of gain-loss framing on such cyber security decisions.
