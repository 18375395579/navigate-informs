Title: Supporting Parallel and Distributed Constraint-Based Local Search Algorithms.<br>Author: Laurent Michel, Assistant Professor, Computer Science & Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States, ldm@engr.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pascal Van Hentenryck<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Optimization applications are challenging because of size, complexity or online requirements. At the same time, commodity multiprocessors offer significant opportunities but remain extremely challenging to program and use. It is therefore capital to lower the barrier to their adoption in the optimization domain. This talk offers an answer: programming language abstractions to minimize the distance between sequential and parallel and distributed algorithms.
