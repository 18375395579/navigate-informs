<br>Title: An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to a Production-inventory Problem</br><br>Author: Christiane Barz, University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business, Chicago, IL, 60637, barz@uchicago.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Adelman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to a deterministic production-inventory control problem in which not all states are reachable from every other state. We address the technical difficulties in applying ADP to resolve this issue, and discuss theoretical and numerical results.</br>
