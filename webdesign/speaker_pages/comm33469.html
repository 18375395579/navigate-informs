Title: Designing Contracts with Options for Pharmaceutical R&D Alliances<br>Author: Nicos Savva, Research Associate, Cambridge University, Judge Business School, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, n.savva@jbs.cam.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Stefan Scholtes<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Designing robust long-term contracts for R&D alliances is challenging. Changes in the marketplace, the political and regulatory  environment, or the strategy of the partners threaten the viability of the partnership. Flexibility is important to cope with these uncertainties. In contracts, flexibility can be operationalised through options clauses. We will show how OR models can help value such options clauses and optimise contract design.
