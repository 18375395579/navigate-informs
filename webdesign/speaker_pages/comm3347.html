Title: Service Delivery Modeling and Optimization<br>Author: Yixin Diao, IBM, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, diao@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Aliza R. Heching, David Northcutt<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This project addresses the problem of identifying optimal staffing (staffing levels, shifts, and skills) for IBM's globally located IT service delivery teams. Over the past three years, the project team has defined, developed, and deployed complex simulation models across multiple service line disciplines. These models have been deployed on a massive scale across the global scope of the IBM delivery organization. This has resulted in improved resource usage, delivery efficiency, and service quality over a large number of service delivery teams.
