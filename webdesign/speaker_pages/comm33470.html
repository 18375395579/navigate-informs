Men at 10-year risk for CHD (2.5% - 25%) were examined. Parameters were taken from literature. Aspirin was more effective and less costly than no treatment in 45-year-old men (7.5% 10-year risk). Addition of statin to aspirin therapy becomes more cost-effective when patient’s 10-year CHD risk is higher than 10%.</br>
