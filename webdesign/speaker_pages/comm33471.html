<br>Title: Optimal Incentives for Pro-Social Innovation</br><br>Author: Yi Xu, Assistant Professor, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States of America, yxu@miami.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The adoption of a pro-social innovation or new product (e.g., fuel efficient automobile) has a positive impact on social welfare.  However, both firms and consumers may not fully take this positive social impact into account in their decision making.  In this paper, we study how a social planner could play an active role in promoting and stimulating such pro-social innovations through various incentive mechanisms.</br>
