<br>Title: Simulating the Trade-offs Between Wildfire, Prescribed Fire, and Fire Prevention</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Prestemon, Research Forester, USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, PO Box 12254, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27709, United States of America, jprestemon@fs.fed.us</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Butry</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Wildfire can be managed through suppression, fuels management, and fire prevention education efforts. We empirically estimate the statistical trade-offs among these three types of management at the county and fire district scales in Florida using annual and monthly data on wildfire occurrence, area burned, prescribed fire area, and several categories of fire prevention efforts made by the State, 1980-2006. Simulations identify theoretically optimal spending allocations by spatial unit.</br>
