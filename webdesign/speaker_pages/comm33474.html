Instead, maybe Kodak should have initially pursued cheaper, simpler digitals. We compare and contrast these two possible strategies, developing an analytical framework that relates these strategies to the notions of disruptive innovation, blue oceans, and willingness to cannibalize. We discuss the link between Kodak’s encroachment strategy and its operational and marketing capabilities.</br>
