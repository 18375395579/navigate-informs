<br>Title: Seat Value in Stadiums and Theaters: An Empirical Investigation</br><br>Author: Ramnath Vaidyanathan, PhD Student, The Wharton School, 500 Jon M Huntsman Hall, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, ramnathv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Senthil Veeraraghavan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study how seat value perceived by patrons attending an event in a theater/stadium, depends on the location of their seat relative to the stage/field. Using a proprietary dataset collected by a professional baseball franchise, we quantify the influence of seat location and consumer characteristics on customers' ex-post valuations. We find that frequent customers experience lower variance in their valuations, and customers in symmetric seat locations might perceive very different values.</br>
