<br>Title: Inferring Link Flows using Partial Flow Information: A Strategic Vehicle Sensor Deployment Approach</br><br>Author: Srinivas Peeta, peeta@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shou-Ren Hu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Current studies generally assume that full scale link traffic flow information is available for development of relevant traffic management strategies. However, such assumptions are unrealistic due to budgetary limitations of highway management agencies. We develop a basis approach to strategically deploy vehicle sensors so that link flows can be determined using information collected by some sensors. Numerical analysis is conducted to verify the merits of this approach.</br>
