Title: Patching the Cloud: Impact of SaaS on Patching and Software Defects<br>Author: Zhe (James) Zhang, UC Irvine, UC Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States of America, zhez1@uci.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vidyanand Choudhary<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A key difference between traditional on-premise software and SaaS is that the users are responsible for running traditional software whereas the vendor is responsible for running SaaS software. We examine this change on the vendor’s optimal software release time and proportion of software defects to fix. We find that the SaaS vendor releases the software earlier with more defects, and patches fewer defects; and the number of defects after patching is lower than the socially efficient outcome.
