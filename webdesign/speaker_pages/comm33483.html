Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, jheier@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Ergun, Julie Swann</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study facility location problems motivated by emergency response scenarios, such as anti-viral distribution during a flu pandemic.  In these problems, decentralized users choose among the facilities opened by a centralized planner. Our models incorporate user behavior in facility location decisions. We demonstrate that the impact of failure to account for user behavior is substantial and show that providing incentives and information can improve the performance of decentralized systems.</br>
