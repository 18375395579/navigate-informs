Title: The Mobility of Scientists during Economic Downturns and its Impact on Technology Trajectories<br>Author: Eyiwunmi Akinsanmi, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Baker Hall 129, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, eyiwunmi@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ray Reagans, Erica Fuchs<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate how inventor mobility after the burst of the telecommunications bubble impacts innovation using 350 hand-collected resumes of U.S. photonics inventors. Our preliminary results suggest that emerging technology inventors that move to new markets increase innovation, driving national trends.  In addition we find that using patents alone ?without the additional information provided in CVs as has been done in the past ?fails to provide these insights.
