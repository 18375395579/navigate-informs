<br>Title: Preference Minorities and the Internet</br><br>Author: David Bell, Wharton School, 700 Huntsman Hall, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, davidb@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): JeongHye Choi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Internet retailing is pervasive yet its value to individual shoppers is largely determined by the local offline context.      We examine local customer adoption of a specialized online retailing service (Diapers.com) and find that demand first decreases then increases in the local proportion of customers who are matched to the service. In addition, we document a similar effect at the product level and compare the Internet demand patterns for nationally branded and specialty producuts.</br>
