Title: Capacity Disruption Risk in Production Enterprise Networks<br>Author: Martin Wortman, Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, 77843-3131, United States, wortman@mwx.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alex Savachkin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The introduction of lean business practices can greatly enhance the operating efficiency of production enterprises; however, these practices can also leave production networks brittle with dramatically increased exposure to disruptions in both production and supply capacities. In this talk, we explore capacity disruption risk in large production networks.  In particular, we examine structural properties of the underlying stochastic processes that characterize disruption risk.
