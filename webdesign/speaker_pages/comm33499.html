Title: Social Advertising: Does Social Influence Work ?<br>Author: Ashish Agarwal, McCombs School of Business, U T Austin, Austin, TX, 78759, United States of America, ashish.agarwal@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kartik Hosanagar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Using data for several ads on Facebook we measure the impact of past connections on the click rate and endorsement rate of ads.  We find that increase in the connections does not lead to an increase in the click performance and may even decrease the click performance. Our results inform advertisers on how the social influence impacts the performance of their ads and how should they advertise on social platforms such as Facebook.
