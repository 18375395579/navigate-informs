<br>Title: Optimal Mix of Screening and Contact Tracing for Endemic Diseases (Submitted for the 2006 Pierskalla Award)</br><br>Author: Margaret Brandeau, Professor, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, Stanford, CA, United States, brandeau@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Armbruster</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Screening and contact tracing are two common means of controlling infectious diseases.  We present a mathematical model that determines the cheapest mix of screening and contact tracing necessary to achieve a desired endemic disease prevalence or to identify a specified number of cases.  We present theoretical results and discuss their practical implications.</br>
