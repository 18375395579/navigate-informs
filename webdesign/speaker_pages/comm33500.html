Title: Simulation to Assess Quarantine Station Continuity of Operations in Response to Pandemic Influenza<br>Author: Robert Brigantic, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, 902 Battelle Blvd., P.O. Box 999, Richland, WA, 99352, United States of America, robert.brigantic@pnl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): John Malone<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This presentation summarizes efforts conducted for DHS to simulate the flow of aircraft and passengers arriving from international destinations under an assumed Pandemic Influenza Federal Government Response Stage 2 which activates domestic quarantine stations.  Starting with the CDC Quarantine Station Seattle, this research assesses current capabilities and examines the requirements for effective quarantine and isolation of people potentially infected with a pandemic strain of influenza.
