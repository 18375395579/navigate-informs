However, unlike other management disciplines, Operations Management does not have a strong record of connecting theory development and empirical analysis. The objective of the tutorial is to address this disconnect. We will discuss several forms in which theoretical (modeling) research can be combined with empirical (econometric) research, including structural estimation, micro-level productivity studies, and instrumental variable estimation.</br>
