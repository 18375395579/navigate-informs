Title: Econometric Models in Operations Management<br>Author: Christian Terwiesch, Professor, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, terwiesch@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The last couple of years have witnessed an increased interest in empirical research in Operations Management. However, unlike other management disciplines, Operations Management does not have a strong record of connecting theory development and empirical analysis. The objective of the tutorial is to address this disconnect. We will discuss several forms in which theoretical (modeling) research can be combined with empirical (econometric) research, including structural estimation, micro-level productivity studies, and instrumental variable estimation.
