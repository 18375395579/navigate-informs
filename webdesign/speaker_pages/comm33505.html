Title: Measuring and Monetizing Development Risk<br>Author: Murray Cantor, Distinguished Engineer, IBM, 209 Burgess Ave, Westwood, MA, 02090, United States of America, mcantor@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Standard risk management practices take a qualitative approach; having staff score the likelihood of occurrence and impact, prioritizing high occurrence/impact risks for mitigation. The practice is rarely followed as it is not central to the project focus on delivery. I introduce a quantitative approach for measuring development risk that is a basis for measuring development project health and for monetization supporting informed go/no-go decisions for undertaking and continuing risky projects.
