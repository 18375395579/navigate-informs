Title: An Examination of the Relative Age Effect (RAE) in Texas High School Swimming<br>Author: James Cochran, Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA, United States of America, jcochran@latech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lauren Brewer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The RAE is the phenomena that explains the competitive disadvantages faced by children born immediately prior to a static birthdate deadline for establishing age-based cohorts. The RAE has been found across athletic and academic pursuits and is related to depression and suicide rates. We assess RAE for high school swimmers on data collected in Houston. Our results provide a link for establishing a causal relationship between a static deadline for establishing age-based cohorts and the RAE.
