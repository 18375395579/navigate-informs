<br>Title: Globalization of Software Innovation</br><br>Author: Chris Forman, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, cforman@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ashish Arora, Matej Drev</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Using patent data from the US, we provide evidence on the geographic distribution of inventive activity in software. We show that at present inventive activity in software remains concentrated in locations within the US and among US firms. Dividing software patenting activity into sectors, we further demonstrate that inventive activity in software outside of the US tends to be concentrated in software that requires less interaction with users.</br>
