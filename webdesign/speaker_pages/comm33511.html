A holistic view is more appropriate when a supply chain is disrupted due to an emergency or disaster, as many of the key decisions to be made are interdependent. We present a capacitated, multi-commodity flow model under two competing objectives and demonstrate how viability-based decision making can impact both performance measures of interest.</br>
