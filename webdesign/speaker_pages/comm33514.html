<br>Title: Building Reliable Air-travel Infrastructure Using Empirical Data and Stochastic Models</br><br>Author: Mazhar Arikan, University of Kansas, School of Business, Lawrence, KS, United States of America, mazhar@ku.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Milind Sohoni, Vinayak Deshpande</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Flight delays have been a growing issue and they have reached an all time high in recent years. We develop stochastic models, using empirical data, to analyze the propagation of delays through air-transportation networks. We then analyze robustness measures for airline networks. Our analysis enables us to make policy recommendations regarding managing bottleneck resources in the air-travel infrastructure, which if addressed, could lead to a significant improvement in air-travel reliability.</br>
