Title: Surgeon, Surgical Team and Surgery-recovery System Knowledge Generation and Learning in a Hospital<br>Author: David Moore, Ph.D, KLICNET.ORG, The Knowledge, Learning and Intellectual Capital Network, 3788 Davidson Place, Boulder, CO, 80305, United States, dmoore@klicnet.org<br>Coauthor(s): Nile Hatch<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Learning curves of surgeons, surgical teams and the surgery-recovery system of a hospital are analyzed using data collected over a five year period.  We explore potential interactions between surgeons, surgical teams, and the surgery-recovery system learning processes.  Interviews with surgeons, staff, unit managers and C-level administrators plus hundreds of hours of direct, protocol-guided observation provide foundations for designing empirical studies and interpreting empirical results.
