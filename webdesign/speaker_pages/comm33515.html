We explore potential interactions between surgeons, surgical teams, and the surgery-recovery system learning processes.  Interviews with surgeons, staff, unit managers and C-level administrators plus hundreds of hours of direct, protocol-guided observation provide foundations for designing empirical studies and interpreting empirical results.</br>
