A patient with health h is given b(h) points which are to be allocated among L mutually exclusive sets of livers, assuming that b(h) is monotone in factors such as health and waiting time. The primary optimization question is how a patient with given health and preferences should allocate points. We discuss model formulation and several structural properties related to this allocation system.</br>
