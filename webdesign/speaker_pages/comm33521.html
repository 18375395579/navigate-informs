Title: Mitigating Infectious Disease Outbreaks in Medical Facilities with Incomplete Vaccination<br>Author: Thomas Moore, Complexity Scientist, Sandia National Labs, MS 1138, Albuquerque, NM, United States of America, tmoore@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Finley, Richard Martinello, Carter Mecher, Katherine Jones, Victoria Davey<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Health care facilities are vulnerable to outbreaks of contagious disease. Managing outbreaks in facilities relies on identifying transmission pathways and limiting new infections. Interventions include targeted vaccination and staff furloughs, but these are complicated by incomplete information about staff susceptibility and vaccine refusal. We model the spread of Varicella and analyze the impact of staffing policy and vaccination programs on the affected facility and on surrounding facilities.
