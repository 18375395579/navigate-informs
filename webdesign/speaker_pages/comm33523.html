Title: Epidemiological Modeling in Sparse Data Environments: an Approach to Data Collection and Analysis<br>Author: Joel Alejandre, Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Ave SW, Washington, DC, 20375, United States of America, joel.alejandre@nrl.navy.mil<br>Coauthor(s): Roger Hillson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In austere environments with limited network-coverage and poor medical record systems, a platform is needed for collecting and geographically contextualizing health data to assist pathogenic outbreak detection. A Sierra Leone use-case illustrates data collection (demographic, health, and physical features); utilization of population estimation products for data-normalization; and health reporting over mobile networks. This analysis will facilitate the judicious deployment of medical resources.
