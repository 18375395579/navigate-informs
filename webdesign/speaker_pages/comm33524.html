Title: Stand Allocation in Airports - New Solution Approaches and Results<br>Author: Rodrigo Acuna Agost, Operations Research - Innovation, Amadeus, 485 Route du Pin Montard, Sophia Antipolis, 06902, France, rodrigo.acunaagost@amadeus.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mourad Boudia, Thierry Delahaye, Julien Guepet, Daniel Perez<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Stand Allocation Problem consists in finding an assignment of aircraft turnarounds to parking positions. The usual objectives include maximizing the number of passenger assigned to contact stands, and minimizing the number of tows.  In this talk we show new methods including MIP-based, CP-based, Column Generation, and metaheuristics approaches. The results of experiments show significant improvements on several KPIs compared to the current practice on real data from two European airports.
