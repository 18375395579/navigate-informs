To investigate the performance of dispatching rules, simulation experiments have been conducted with three different rules which include newly proposed Flow rate-based rule, FIFO and EDD. The simulation results provide guidelines for designing centralized check-in on the criteria of clinic makespan, patient tardiness for appointment and patient waiting time for check-in.</br>
