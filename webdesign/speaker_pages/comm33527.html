<br>Title: Individualized Socio-technical Congruence: Metrics, Exploration, and Impact</br><br>Author: Patrick Wagstrom, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Research on organizational performance suggests that the closer organizational communication patterns mirror dependencies within the organization, a concept called socio-technical congruence (STC), the higher the performance the team.  However, communication is never without cost.  Particularly, within radically distributed teams individual cost may outweigh organizational benefits.  This work formalizes methods for measuring individualized STC and addresses the  implications of the measure.</br>
