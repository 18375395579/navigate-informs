Title: Managing Pre-Technological Knowledge: A Multi-Dimensional Approach<br>Author: Charles Weber, Assistant Professor of Engineering and Technology Management, Portland State University, ETM, PO Box 751, Portland, OR, 97207, United States, webercm@gmail.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Bohn (1994) states that many high technology industrial processes are based on pre-technological knowledge -- knowledge that is incompletely characterized or cannot be measured.  An empirical study suggests that high tech industrial processes are based on on subsystem knowledge and prior, architectural knowledge that has been completely characterized. However, integration knowledge is pre-technological, and may be inherently so.
