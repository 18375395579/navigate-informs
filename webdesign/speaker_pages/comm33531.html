Title: Predicting the Sum of All Evils: Aggregate Level Modeling of Non-Conformances<br>Author: Vittal Prabhu, Associate Professor, Penn State University, 348 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, prabhu@engr.psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nazrul Shaikh<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Estimating the potential number of non-conformances in a product is critical for compliance and quality management. It is also a measure of the efficacy of the monitoring and control strategies associated with the process. In this work, a growth model for describing the observed non-conformances is developed and tested empirically. The model captures the interplay between maintenance strategies and reliability, and can be used as an early warning system for non-conformances and warranty costs.
