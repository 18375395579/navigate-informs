Title: Open Innovation: The Solver's Choice<br>Author: Cheryl Druehl, Assistant Professor, George Mason University, School of Management, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, cdruehl@gmail.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In Open Innovation, companies with problems (seekers) search for external individuals with solutions (solvers). Previous work has found that the problems require some expertise and having a higher number of solvers is better for the seeker. But solvers have many choices of problems as well as outside interests. What motivates them to participate and to choose a particular problem? We incorporate previous empirical findings as well as risk aversion into a model of solver choice.
