<br>Title: Partial Input to Output Impacts in DEA: Resource Sharing among Business Sub-units</br><br>Author: Wade Cook, York University, Schulich School of Business, Toronto, ON, Canada, wcook@schulich.yorku.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Raha Imanirad, Joe Zhu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: While it is generally assumed in DEA that all outputs are impacted by all inputs, there are many situations where this may not be the case. For example, in a food manufacturing setting, certain foods are exempt from nutrition labeling and as a result are not influenced by labeling resources. This paper extends the conventional DEA methodology to allow for the measurement of technical efficiency in situations where only partial input-to-output impacts exist.</br>
