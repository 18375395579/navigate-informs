Hausman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In warranty inventory management, customers return allegedly malfunctioning products for replacement or credit. Useful products may be recovered through testing and/or remanufacturing. We formulate both exact and heuristic dynamic programming models for this situation to minimize system costs. We also explore the effects of visibility in the reverse channel.</br>
