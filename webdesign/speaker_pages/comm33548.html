Title: Improving Community Cohesion in School Choice via Correlated-lottery Implementation<br>Author: Peng Shi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, pengshi@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Itai Ashlagi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In many cities, students apply to public schools by submitting a ranked list of schools to a centralized lottery. One criticism is that kids from the same community are scattered across the city. We study how much one can improve community cohesion by correlating the lottery for students from the same community. We derive analytical expressions under a large market approximation, and show that gain is greater when preferences are more correlated. We show promising simulation results for Boston.
