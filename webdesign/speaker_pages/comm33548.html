One criticism is that kids from the same community are scattered across the city. We study how much one can improve community cohesion by correlating the lottery for students from the same community. We derive analytical expressions under a large market approximation, and show that gain is greater when preferences are more correlated. We show promising simulation results for Boston.</br>
