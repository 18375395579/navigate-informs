Title: Optimizing Train Plans: Case Studies from the Field<br>Author: Arvind Kumar, Director - Research & Development, Innovative Scheduling, Inc., GTEC, 2153 Hawthorne Road,, Suite 128, Gainesville, FL, 32641, United States, arvind@InnovativeScheduling.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ravindra Ahuja, Krishna Jha, Larry Shughart<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The train plan design is central to a railroad’s operating plan development process and dictates the movement of railcars, locomotives, and crews over the railroad’s network. This talk presents results of several pilot studies on real-life data to demonstrate that optimized train plans can improve operations significantly. The focus of theses studies was to identify opportunities where small changes can result in big improvements in a railroad's costs.
