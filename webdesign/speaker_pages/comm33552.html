<br>Title: Dose Calculations: Where and How to Measure Dose</br><br>Author: Allen Holder, Trinity University Mathematics, One Trinity Place, San Antonio, TX, United States of America, aholder@trinity.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Uhlig, Arthur Hanna</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The accuracy of treatment design depends on appropriate estimations of delivered dose.  However, the size of the underlying optimization problem increases with the accuracy of dose, often leading to problems of unusual size.  So, limiting the dose model is important but needs to be accomplished to reduce the loss of accuracy.  We discuss a new technique to measure dose and the supporting data structures.</br>
