Title: Improving Emergency Room Capacity Efficiency<br>Author: Vesa Kämäräinen, Helsinki University of Technology, Otanimentie 17, Espoo, 02, Finland, vesa.kamarainen@tkk.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Karita Ilvonen, Hanna Lehtonen, Ari Palomäki, Petri Parvinen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many emergency rooms have either insufficient resources or inefficient ways to use them, or both. In this paper, emergency room capacity efficiency is approached from two perspectives: resource efficiency and resource availability. These aspects are analyzed through demand-supply analysis. This study resulted in concrete capacity efficiency improvements with respect to ER premises and staffing.
