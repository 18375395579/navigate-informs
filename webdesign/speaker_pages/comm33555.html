Title: The Influence of Psychological Safety and Confidence on Employee Knowledge Sharing<br>Author: Enno Siemsen, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 350 Wohlers Hall, 1206 S.

Reconciling conflicting findings in the literature, we demonstrate that while psychological safety is an important antecedent of knowledge sharing, the relationship between these two constructs is moderated by the level of confidence that employees have in what they know. The higher her level of confidence, the less is the importance of psychological safety in facilitating knowledge sharing.
