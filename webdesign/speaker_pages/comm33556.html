<br>Title: A Two-stage Statistical Approach to Modeling the Potential Surface in Nanoquantification</br><br>Author: Peter Qian, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States of America, peterq@stat.wisc.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Quantifying the potential from nanomaterial under AFM scanning is  challenged by the massive and complicated topography. A physical model is difficult to fully capture the relations between potential and topography. In this work, we propose a two-stage statistical approach to build the link between potential and topography and then explore the spatial dependence of the potential surface. Better prediction performance of the new approach can be demonstrated by numerical study.</br>
