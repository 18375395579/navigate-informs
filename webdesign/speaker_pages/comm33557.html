Michel-Kerjan, Managing Director, Center for Risk Management and Decision Processes, OPIM Department - The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Jon Huntsman Hall, 5th Floor, Room 556, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104-6340, erwannmk@Wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Howard Kunreuther<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: What is the best way for the nation to recover from large-scale disasters? To address this question we analyze the central role that insurance plays and the limits to insurability of these events by the private sector alone.  Focusing on 5 states (California, Florida, New York, South Carolina and Texas), we examine a set of alternative disaster insurance and mitigation programs. This analysis provides a broad range of interested parties with a better understanding of who will pay what after the next extreme event.
