<br>Title: Marketing Attribution in a Multichannel Customer Relationship Setting</br><br>Author: Marcel Goic, Assistant Professor, University of Chile, Chile, mgoic@dii.uchile.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kirthi Kalyanam, Kinshuk Jerath</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this research we explore how a multichannel contact with the customer affects her likelihood of making a purchase and how much attribution should be given to each touch point. We propose a parsimonious model where the propensity to buy and use each channel is mediated by latent inventories of information which accumulate as the customer get in contact with the firm.  Empirical results using data from an online retailer suggest that the channels play different roles in the purchase process.</br>
