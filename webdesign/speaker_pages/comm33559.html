So stated Sen. Dianne Feinstein in arguing for new legislation mandating that the Department of Homeland Security allocate grants to states based on risk.  Comparing the (formula-based) 2005 and (risk-based) 2006 grant allocations reveals no change in the state shares of the homeland security grants pie, with awards remaining proportional to population.  Whether such appropriations are appropriate is the subject of this talk.</br>
