<br>Title: Data and Analytics Integration for Operational Biosurveillance</br><br>Author: Nancy Grady, AVP Data Mining, SAIC, POB 2501, 301 Laboratory Rd, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831, United States, NANCY.W.GRADY@saic.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Jones, Kimothy Smith</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Current development of operational BioSurveillance systems has generated new requirements for integration.  Newly emerging threats require the integration of data streams from many disciplines and sources. Integration of the reasoning over a suite of analytical methods is needed for the evaluation of anomalies. Using experience drawn from the National BioSurveillance Integration System (NBIS), the techniques for the development of an integrated situational awareness will be discussed.</br>
