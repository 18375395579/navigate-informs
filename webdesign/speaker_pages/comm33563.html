Title: Limits to Front Loading in a Product Development Pipeline<br>Author: Nitin Joglekar, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, United States of America, joglekar@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paulo Figueiredo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Management of NPD pipeline involves steering several promising projects through a sequence of screens. We explore the effects of relevant decisions in a 3-stage pipeline by varying screen thresholds, complexity of projects and managerial biases while adjusting utilization. Our analysis establishes convex relationships between portfolio value at the end of pipeline and global resource allocation and complexity variables, indicating a limit for front loading practices owing to congestion effects.
