The purpose of this study is to investigate the nature and extent of the traditional  advertising effect of paid search. Based on an advertising framework, the authors test whether paid search affects direct visits to the site. Using data from the automotive industry the authors find that the advertising effect is significant and recovers about 15% of the daily cost of the paid search campaign.
