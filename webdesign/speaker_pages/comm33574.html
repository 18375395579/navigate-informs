The wide spread of the internet has lead to a colossal amount of  information posted by consumers on the web through mediums such as  forums, blogs, and product reviews.  This type of information offers  the firm an opportunity to listen to consumers. We rely on large  network analysis techniques in converting the text mining data into  market structure analysis.  The networks in our research are not  consumer networks but rather semantic ones in which the nodes consist  of concepts, products, or commonly used terms.</br>
