<br>Title: A Network-of-networks Approach to Terrorist Detection</br><br>Author: Michael Atkinson, Institute for Computational and Mathemat, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, mpa33@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Wein</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We formulate a model to identify terrorists through their participation in non-terror networks such as money laundering and dealing in illicit drugs.  The government allocates resources among these networks to maximize the number of terrorists identified, but only the degree distribution within each network and overlap distribution between networks are known. The government performs both an initial global search and a secondary local search to detect terrorists in these interconnected networks.</br>
