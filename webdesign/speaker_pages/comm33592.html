<br>Title: On the Evaluation of Strategic Options</br><br>Author: Gilberto Montibeller, Dr, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London, WC2 2AE, United Kingdom, G.Montibeller@lse.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Strategic options have a distinctive nature, when compared with the ones considered in Operations Research. They generate long term consequences that are hard to take into account. They are going to be put in place in an environment bound by uncertainty, where is difficult to define probabilities of events. And their selection needs to be negotiated by the managerial team. In this paper I discuss such challenges and suggest ways of providing decision support in these situations.</br>
