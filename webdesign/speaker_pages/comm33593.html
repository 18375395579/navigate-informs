<br>Title: Can We Quantify the Risk of Cascading Failure Blackouts with Branching Processes?</br><br>Author: Ian Dobson, Professor, University of Wisconsin, ECE Department, 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, dobson@engr.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Janghoon Kim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Blackouts of the electric power transmission infrastructure are complicated events in a huge network with diverse, interacting failures.  The failures cascade by weakening the system and making further failures more likely.  We model cascading in a bulk statistical fashion as initial failures propagating probabilistically according to a branching process. We estimate branching process parameters from data and hence compute the probability of cascading failures of various sizes.</br>
