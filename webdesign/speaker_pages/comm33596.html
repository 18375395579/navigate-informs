Title: Is El Nino Still a Good Predictor for Monsoon Rainfall?: Detecting Changes in Covariance<br>Author: Lucy Robinson, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, Department of Statistics, Room 1005, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, lfr24@columbia.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Historically, the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a global climate  phenomenon, has been used to predict droughts in India, and is known to be correlated with Monsoon rainfall in other parts of the world. In recent years climatologists have speculated that this relationship is weakening. We use retrospective change point detection techniques to address this issue, attempting to identify shifts in covariance over the last 130 years.
