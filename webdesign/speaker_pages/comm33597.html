The presence of overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening, however, has a potential for harm. We quantify the impact of overdiagnosis on quality adjusted life years and expected number of mammograms over a lifetime under various screening policies.  Recommended screening intervals based on a Markov-based model ranged from 2 to 3 years depending on conditions.
