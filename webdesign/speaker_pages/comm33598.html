Title: A Queuing Network to Improve the U.S. Military Service Member Disability Rating Process<br>Author: James Broyles, RAND Corporation, 1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, CA, United States of America, jbroyles@rand.org<br>Coauthor(s): Heather Krull, Matthew Haugseth<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Wounded U.S. veterans can obtain a disability rating that determines their fitness to serve and their compensation.  By integrating processes, average rating time has decreased from 540 to less than 305 days.  However, management is unsure where to make process improvements for the largest time benefit.  This research presents a queuing network with queuing-based statistical approaches to estimate unobserved parameters using Army data.  The results include recommended areas for improvement.
