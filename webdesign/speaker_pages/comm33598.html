By integrating processes, average rating time has decreased from 540 to less than 305 days.  However, management is unsure where to make process improvements for the largest time benefit.  This research presents a queuing network with queuing-based statistical approaches to estimate unobserved parameters using Army data.  The results include recommended areas for improvement.</br>
