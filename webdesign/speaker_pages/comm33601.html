Title: Redirecting Attention: Overcoming the Illegitimacy Discount<br>Author: Eric Yanfei Zhao, University of Alberta, 2-24 Business Building, U of Alberta Business School, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R6, Canada, ericy.f.zhao@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Lounsbury<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: How can organizations spanning rigid categories solve the dilemma of sameness and difference and gain attention and favorable evaluation from audiences? In this paper, we argue that organizations can deploy cultural resources such as name to overcome audience inattention and legitimacy deficit due to category spanning. We tested and found support for this proposition using a sample of films released in the U.S. market between 1982 and 2007.
