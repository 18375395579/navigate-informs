Title: Optimizing Locations for Ocean Wave Energy Farms under Uncertainty<br>Author: Lawrence V.

We obtain solutions that are significantly more robust than those in the literature, which perform poorly when the wave environment changes only slightly. We also discuss qualitative results concerning how the optimal layouts change as the ocean characteristics change.
