<br>Title: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Finding Nash Equilibrium of Multi-player Matrix Games</br><br>Author: Tapas K. Das, Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, das@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vishnu Nanduri</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: With the advent of e-commerce, the contemporary marketplace has evolved significantly toward competition-based trading of goods and services. Many such market scenarios can be modeled as matrix games. This paper presents a computational algorithm to obtain Nash  equilibria of n-player matrix games. The RL algorithm is tested on a set of sixteen matrix games with up to four players and sixty four action choices.</br>
