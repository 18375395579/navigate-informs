<br>Title: Models and Algorithms to Support a Pandemic Interactive Exercise Tool (PanViz) for State of Indiana</br><br>Author: Robert Brigantic, Operations Research Scientist, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, 902 Battelle Blvd., Richland, WA, 99352, United States of America, robert.brigantic@pnl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Muller, John Malone</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Epidemiologic models and algorithms for pandemic influenza were developed to support pandemic influenza exercises for the Indiana Department of Health in collaboration with the Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC) and their Pandemic Interactive Exercise Tool (PanViz). PanViz models outputs by city/county/ state include basic demographics, infected number and stage, medical resource requirements and availability, with geospatial and temporal impact over time.</br>
