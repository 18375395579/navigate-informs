Title: A Model for Integrated Decision in Information Security Investment<br>Author: Tridib Bandyopadhyay, Assistant Professor, Kennesaw State University, 1000 Chastain Road, Kennesaw, GA, 30144, United States, tbandyop@kennesaw.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dengpan Liu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Firms invest in perimeter hardening as well as intrusion detection systems, but often under stand-alone decision frameworks. This could mean suboptimal investments in general. In this paper we develop a model that helps answer 1) How to optimally split available IT security budget among prevention and detection regimes? and 2) When an IDS is in place, how to choose the operating point in the detection regime, and investment in the prevention regime to lower the overall system cost?
