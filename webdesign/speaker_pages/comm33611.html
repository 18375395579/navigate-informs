This could mean suboptimal investments in general. In this paper we develop a model that helps answer 1) How to optimally split available IT security budget among prevention and detection regimes? and 2) When an IDS is in place, how to choose the operating point in the detection regime, and investment in the prevention regime to lower the overall system cost?</br>
