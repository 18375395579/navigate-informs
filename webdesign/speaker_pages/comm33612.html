From the dataset (1997-2006), we can identify the factors and the structural change of the types of information security risks disclosed in financial reports using a text mining tool. These factors can be further applied to cross-sectional analyses to examine whether financial reporting disclosures can mitigate the impact of information security incidents on business value.
