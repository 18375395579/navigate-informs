<br>Title: Text Mining: Major Factors of Information Security Risks Disclosed in Financial Reports</br><br>Author: Ta-Wei Wang, Doctoral Student, Purdue University, 403 West State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, wang131@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jackie Rees</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Our paper tries to explore the major factors of information security related risks disclosed in financial reports. From the dataset (1997-2006), we can identify the factors and the structural change of the types of information security risks disclosed in financial reports using a text mining tool. These factors can be further applied to cross-sectional analyses to examine whether financial reporting disclosures can mitigate the impact of information security incidents on business value.</br>
