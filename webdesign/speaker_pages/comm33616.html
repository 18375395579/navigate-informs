Title: Multi-modality Data Fusion using Sparse Composite Linear Discriminant Analysis<br>Author: Shuai Huang, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States of America, shuai.huang.ie@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jing Li<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This research develops a novel method, the sparse composite linear discriminant analysis, to perform feature selection from high-dimensional multi-modality data.  An application in identifying alzheimer's disease-related brain regions by fusing PET and MRI images is provided.
