In this paper, we present our work with the Delivery Unit of a large teaching hospital that investigates two mechanisms through which workload affects outcomes (i) the amount of resources dedicated to individual patient care, and (ii) the quality of execution given the resource provision. We discuss our findings and their operational (and medical) implications.</br>
