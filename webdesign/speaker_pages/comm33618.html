Title: Decomposing the Effect of Workload on Patient Outcomes<br>Author: Nicos Savva, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, United Kingdom, nsavva@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stefan Scholtes, Michael Freeman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Extant literature has documented that in-patient outcomes deteriorate at high workloads. In this paper, we present our work with the Delivery Unit of a large teaching hospital that investigates two mechanisms through which workload affects outcomes (i) the amount of resources dedicated to individual patient care, and (ii) the quality of execution given the resource provision. We discuss our findings and their operational (and medical) implications.
