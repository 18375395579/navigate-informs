Title: Predicting Influenza<br>Author: George Neumann, Professor of Economics, University of Iowa, Department of Economics, W388 Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, george-neumann@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Forrest Nelson, Philip Polgreen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The official position of the CDC is that influenza outbreaks are not predictable. Using emergency room doctors and nurses as well as epidemiologists and clinical microbiologists we demonstrate that influenza is predictable. Using the state of Iowa and employing prediction markets to aggregate the information possessed by these health practitioners we show that useful predictions of influenza prevalence can be obtained 4 weeks in advance of an outbreak.
