<br>Title: Small Scale Fading Effects on the Control Overhead of Current Protocols.</br><br>Author: Ivan Guardiola, Graduate Student, Texas Tech University, PO box 43061, Lubbock, TX, 79409, United States, ivan.guardiola@ttu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Matis</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research highlights a new method of mitigating the stochastic nature of the wireless signal in various operating environments. It has been found through simulation that a high amount of control overhead does little to increase the overall performance of the network. We propose a new method of protocol design that is considerate to this stochasticity of the wireless signal and employs GPS technology at the receiver to accept or reject specific protocol communication demands.</br>
