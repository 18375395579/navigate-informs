<br>Title: How Interactivity in Tutorials Affects Student Learning: Results from a Spreadsheet Modeling Problem</br><br>Author: Linda Leon, Associate Professor, Loyola Marymount, University, One LMU Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90045, lleon@lmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zbigniew Przasnyski, Kala Seal</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We describe a controlled experiment to assess the impact of different levels of interactivity in tutorials designed to help students learn how to model the transportation problem in a spreadsheet. Our results indicate that some computer-based interactive tutorial support does improve students?learning but too much interactivity gives rise to cognitive overload and hinders students from consolidating and integrating previous knowledge with new concepts needed to create a meaningful mental model.</br>
