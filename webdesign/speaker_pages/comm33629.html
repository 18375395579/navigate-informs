Title: Objectives Enhances the Number and Quality of Alternatives<br>Author: Johannes Siebert, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany, Johannes.Siebert@uni-bayreuth.de<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: According to Keeney (1992), Value-focused Thinking postulates that objectives should be used to create alternatives. We conducted a series of empirical studies to analyze the effect of the stimulation by objectives in the process of creating alternatives. The results confirm the hypotheses that stimulation with objectives leads to more alternatives, better alternatives, and better sets of alternatives.
