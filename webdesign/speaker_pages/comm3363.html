Title: Combinatorial Auctioneering<br>Author: Charles A. Holt, Professor, University of Virginia, Department of Economics, Charlottesville, VA, United States, cah2k@cms.mail.virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul J.

Package bidding formats generally improve performance.  In environments where collusion is likely, it is effectively broken by a two-stage Anglo-Dutch auction (a combinatorial clock followed by sealed bids).
