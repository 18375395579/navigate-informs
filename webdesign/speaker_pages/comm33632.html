Social media posts on twitter prominently feature discussions about and reactions to scripted televised content. We estimate the causal impact of twitter discourse on television viewership in a large scale natural experiment that measures actual content through NLP techniques and leverages the exogenous lag of premiered televised programming across geographic markets.
