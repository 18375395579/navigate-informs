<br>Title: A Value-based Perspective on Strategy Development</br><br>Author: Jim Matheson, Consulting Professor, Stanford University, Management Science & Engineering, Stanford, CA 94305-4026, SmartOrg, Inc., 855 Oak Grove Avenue, Suite 202, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, United States of America, jmatheson@smartorg.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Strategy Development deals with less structured but very important decisions.  A value-based approach keeps the whole strategy-development process focused on the aspects of the situation that most impact value.  The most valuable strategy emerges after multiple cycles of synthesis and analysis. This talk will give a perspective on how to move from high ambiguity to clear strategy.</br>
