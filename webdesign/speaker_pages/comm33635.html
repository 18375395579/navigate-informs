<br>Title: A Stochastic Game Model on Overseas Cargo Container Security</br><br>Author: Niyazi Bakir, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Southern California, 3710 McClintock Ave., Room 322, Los Angeles, United States of America, nbakir@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erim Kardes</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This study examines the security of incoming overseas cargo at US  ports of entry. We propose a stochastic game model that explores risks at various phases of container movement starting from shipment from a warehouse in a foreign country. We model decisions for both the adversary and the defender to understand the equilibrium behavior in the system as well as the cost effectiveness of countermeasures.</br>
