Title: A Stochastic Game Model on Overseas Cargo Container Security<br>Author: Niyazi Bakir, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Southern California, 3710 McClintock Ave., Room 322, Los Angeles, United States of America, nbakir@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erim Kardes<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This study examines the security of incoming overseas cargo at US  ports of entry. We propose a stochastic game model that explores risks at various phases of container movement starting from shipment from a warehouse in a foreign country. We model decisions for both the adversary and the defender to understand the equilibrium behavior in the system as well as the cost effectiveness of countermeasures.
