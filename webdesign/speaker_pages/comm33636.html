Title: Control of Complex Adaptive Healthcare Systems<br>Author: William Rouse, Professor, Tennenbaum Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology, 760 Spring Street, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0210, United States of America, bill.rouse@ti.gatech.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: One cannot, using any conventional means, command or force complex adaptive systems to comply with behavioral and performance dictates.  The agents in such systems are sufficiently intelligent to game the system, find workarounds, and creatively identify ways to serve their own interests.  The key is to devise a portfolio of incentives and inhibitions that cause agents to behave in desirable ways.  This paper addresses these issues in the context of healthcare delivery.
