<br>Title: Strategic Execution in the Presence of an Uninformed Arbitrageur</br><br>Author: Beomsoo Park, Graduate Student, Stanford University, 161 Packard Building Rm 274, 350 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, beomsoo@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ciamac Moallemi, Benjamin Van Roy</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a trader who aims to liquidate a large position in the presence of an arbitrageur who is uncertain about the trader's position and learns from observed market activity. This is a dynamic game with asymmetric information. We present an algorithm for computing perfect Bayesian equilibrium behavior and conduct numerical experiments. Our results demonstrate that the trader's strategy differs in important ways from one that would be optimal in the absence of an arbitrageur.</br>
