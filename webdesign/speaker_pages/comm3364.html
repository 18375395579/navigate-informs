Title: A Prescription for Budget Woes at Gracious University Hospital<br>Author: Karen Hicklin, North Carolina State University, 111 Lampe Drive, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, kthickli@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anita Vila-Parrish, Julie Ivy<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This case has been used in a multitude of settings including an Industrial Engineering summer camp, a Stochastic Processes course (undergraduate), a Quality Engineering course (undergraduate), and with a health care company.  The strength of this case is its diverse course applications.  In the stochastic processes course the case can focus on understanding variability and uncertainty while in the quality engineering the focus can be on data collection, analysis, and process mapping.  The students have enjoyed the case in all of the settings described above.  The environment is typically one of controlled chaos as the student teams rush around the room fulfilling patient orders.  The competition between teams keeps students motivated throughout the simulation rounds.
