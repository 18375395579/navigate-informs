Title: Auction Mechanisms for Pricing Transportation Networks<br>Author: Lauren Gardner, Graduate Student, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, lmgardner@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Avinash Unnikrishnan, Travis Waller<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The involvement of private investors in roadway development has increased significantly in recent years with the growing popularity of Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects. In cases where multiple private investors compete to manage a set of public roads, auctions may serve as an efficient method to determine ownership of each road. This work will examine characteristics of the auctioning process such that network system performance is optimized.
