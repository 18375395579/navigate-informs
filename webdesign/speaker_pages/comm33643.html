Title: Optimal Learning<br>Author: Warren Powell, Princeton University, Department of ORFE, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, powell@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Frazier<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Optimal learning addresses the challenge of efficiently collecting information to improve our knowledge of the parameters of an optimization problem.  Applications include finding the best choice from a list, allocating resources and finding the best path through an uncertain network.  We describe on-line and off-line applications, and review a variety of practical techniques, including the knowledge gradient algorithm which we illustrate for a general class of learning problems.
