Anand</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We compare three popular pollution control mechanisms–Cap, Cap-and-Trade, and Tax?to each other and to the Groves mechanism. We compare outcomes along several economic variables, including output, firm profits and welfare. We show that firms always reduce output to meet any pollution constraint. We discuss an important implication of the output reduction effect on welfare: the tax rate that achieves Groves is higher, and the cap under Cap-and-Trade lower, than those that maximize welfare.</br>
