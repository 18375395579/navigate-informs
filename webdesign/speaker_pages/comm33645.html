Title: Exploring Unique Learning in Bio-Pharmaceutical Innovation<br>Author: Deborah Dougherty, Professor, Rutgers University, 1169 Lincoln Ct, Long Branch, NJ, 07740, United States, doughert@rbsmail.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Danielle Dunne<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Discovering and developing a new medicine requires ongoing alignment of disparate systems of knowing and doing ?sciences, technologies, strategy, and operations ?over 16 years and across multiple firm boundaries. This process cannot be simplified in the usual way (no paths, feedback, or modularity). We tease out unique learning for compounds and pipeline management, and suggest ways to enhance learning in this science-based industry that can also inform innovation management in general.
