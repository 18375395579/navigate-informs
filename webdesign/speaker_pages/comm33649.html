Title: How Likely is Contagion in Financial Networks?<br>Author: Paul Glasserman, Professor, Columbia University, 403 Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, pg20@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): H. Peyton Young<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Interconnections among financial institutions create potential channels for contagion and amplification of shocks. We bound the network impact on defaults and expected losses under a range of shock distributions. Our analysis assumes only minimal information about network topology, which is important because financial networks are opaque. We find that network effects are small without a high degree of reliance on interbank funding. We illustrate the results with data on the European bank system.
