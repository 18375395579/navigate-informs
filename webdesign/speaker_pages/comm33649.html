Peyton Young</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Interconnections among financial institutions create potential channels for contagion and amplification of shocks. We bound the network impact on defaults and expected losses under a range of shock distributions. Our analysis assumes only minimal information about network topology, which is important because financial networks are opaque. We find that network effects are small without a high degree of reliance on interbank funding. We illustrate the results with data on the European bank system.</br>
