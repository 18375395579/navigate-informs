<br>Title: Service Engineering: A Case Study of Productivity Analysis in the Construction Industry</br><br>Author: Timothy Anderson, Portland State University, 1900 SW 4th Ave, Suite LL-50-02, Portland, OR, United States of America, tima@etm.pdx.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gerald Williams</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: As the U.S. economy has shifted from manufacturing to services, the challenge of understanding and improving services has given birth to the field of service engineering.
