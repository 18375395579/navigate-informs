<br>Title: An Experimental Investigation into the Success or Failure of Joint Ventures</br><br>Author: Kyle Hyndman, Assistant Professor, Maastricht University, Tongersestraat 53, Room A4.06, Maastricht, Netherlands, k.hyndman@maastrichtuniversity.nl</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Joint ventures between firms are popular, yet studies suggest that the chances of success are 50-50. Reasons for failure include unmet expectations, opportunistic behavior and mistrust. We conduct an experiment to understand the importance of these factors. In our experiment, subjects can choose the length of their interaction and also whether to include an exit clause, allowing subjects to end their relationship. We also investigate the role of communication in enabling successful partnerships.</br>
