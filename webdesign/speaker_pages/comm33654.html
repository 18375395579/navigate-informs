Systems biology promises to integrate high-throughput data in a mathematical context to make the connection between genotype and phenotype, and thus may facilitate the rapid identification of drug targets for emerging pathogens.  Two topics will be discussed: (1) the development of novel computational approaches for interrogating properties of mathematical representations of biochemical networks; and (2) the discovery of fundamental biology with systems-level models of human pathogens.</br>
