Bartolacci<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Spreadsheet risk is the chance of adverse operational or financial consequences due to erroneous creation or use of spreadsheets. Such errors can result in poor supply chain or manufacturing or investment decisions, including failure to identify good investments. As spreadsheets have proliferated, this risk has become serious. We describe alternative ways to design spreadsheets to minimize spreadsheet risk. Examples are given of error-prone designs and superior approaches for the same result.
