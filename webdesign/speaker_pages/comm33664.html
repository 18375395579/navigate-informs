However, T2D and its related complications are preventable through healthier lifestyle and dietary choices. In this study, we introduce a population level progression model of T2D. We detail our findings on optimal preventive policies for resource allocation decisions regarding screening, public awareness and patient education programs for self-management around T2D.
