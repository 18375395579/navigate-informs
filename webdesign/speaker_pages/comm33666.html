Because of the existence of multi-level seasonality and special event days, it is very difficult to accurately forecast these two inputs for intervals, such as 15 and 30-minute intervals or even 1-day. This talk will discuss new methods that significantly improve forecast accuracy despite of being based on traditional statistical models.</br>
