Gung, VP for Research and Technologies, ac2 Solutions, Inc., 935 Route 34, Suite 3A, Matawan, NJ, 07747, United States, rogergung@ac2solutions.com<br>Coauthor(s): Turgut Aykin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Call volume and service time forecasts have been most critical inputs to call center workforce management. Because of the existence of multi-level seasonality and special event days, it is very difficult to accurately forecast these two inputs for intervals, such as 15 and 30-minute intervals or even 1-day. This talk will discuss new methods that significantly improve forecast accuracy despite of being based on traditional statistical models.
