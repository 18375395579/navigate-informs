<br>Title: Bounded Rationality in Service Systems</br><br>Author: Gad Allon, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL, United States of America, g-allon@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Achal Bassamboo</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The traditional economics and queueing literature typically assume that customers are fully rational. In contrast, in this paper, we study canonical service models with boundedly rational customers. We capture bounded rationality using a framework in which better decisions are made more often, while the best decision needs not always be made.</br>
