<br>Title: The COIN-OR Optimization Services Project</br><br>Author: Kipp Martin, Professor, University of Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States, kipp.martin@chicagogsb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Fourer, Jun Ma</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Optimization Services (OS) provides a set of standards for representing optimization instances, results, solver options, and communication between clients and solvers in a distributed environment. We provide source code for libraries that implement OS standards. The project includes an executable, OSSolverService, for communicating instances (OSiL XML format, AMPL nl format, MPS format)  to solvers.  Software is provided for communication with  Cbc, Clp, Cplex, Glpk, Ipopt, Knitro, and LINDO.</br>
