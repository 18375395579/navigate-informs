Title: The Impact of Application Spawning in the Internet on Network Neutrality<br>Author: Qiong Wang, Associate Professor, Industrial and Enterprise System Engineering, University of Illnois at Urbana-Champaign, United States of America, qwang04@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Debasis Mitra<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The Internet provides a networked platform to support the spawning of new applications. Revenues from such applications induce a network provider to keep the spawning process viable when making resource allocation decisions. We model this phenomenon and draw inferences of interest in the network neutrality debate. We show that the spawning process counters a provider’s incentive to abuse its monopoly power in offering a metered premium service and a subscription-based best-effort service.
