<br>Title: A Risk Management Approach to Business Process Design</br><br>Author: Xue Bai, CMU, The Heinz School, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, xb@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ramayya Krishnan, Rema Padman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Using a graph-theoretic model of business processes, we develop a decision-theoretic methodology to characterize the risk that the information flows in a business process containing errors by taking into account the structural aspects of a process with respect to error propagation and mitigation. It finds cost-effective ways of embedding controls into specific steps in the business process to meet desired risk thresholds.</br>
