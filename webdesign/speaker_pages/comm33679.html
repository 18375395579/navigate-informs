Title: Service-time Herteogeneity in an Inbound Call Center<br>Author: Noah Gans, OPIM Dept - Wharton - Penn, 3730 Walnut St, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, gans@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haipeng Shen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Service times in call centers are highly variable.  Still, a number of factors ?e.g, which agent it is, the current level of system congestion ?are associated with systematic changes in handle times.  We investigate the sources of variation, as well as the potential effect on the agent staffing.
