Title: A Bivariate Garch Analysis of Real-time and Day-ahead Electricity Prices<br>Author: Nathan Wilson, University of Michigan, nathanew@bus.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shanshan Hu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between the real-time and day-ahead electricity markets operated by the New England Independent Service Operator (ISO). Using time series econometric methods, we examine whether or not the relationship between the conditional means and volatilities of the two price series vary over the course of a day. Finding that they do, we then attempt to determine whether trading strategies based on multivariate GARCH techniques perform better than simpler ones.
