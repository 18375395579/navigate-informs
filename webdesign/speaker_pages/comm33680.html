We discuss estimates calculated using weight data from Marine forces conducting combat and peacekeeping operations in OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM and OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM in Afghanistan and Iraq during the spring and summer of 2004.  We also discuss a tool developed for determining individual and group squad member weight for any billet combination.</br>
