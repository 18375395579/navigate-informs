Title: Averaging Opinions: When Does it Work Well, and When Do People Do it?<br>Author: Jack Soll, Assistant Professor of Management, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, jsoll@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Larrick, Al Mannes<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: People tend to “chase the expert,?preferring a chosen expert’s forecast to an average of several.  Averaging can be highly effective, depending on variation in expertise, correlated errors, and the validity of cues to expertise. To some extent, people adapt their aggregation strategies to the environment. Still, they would do well to average more often.  Chasing the expert is appealing psychologically, and the feedback environment often makes it difficult to learn the benefits of averaging.
