As private companies providing public services, hospitals and medical professionals have to make tough decisions regarding preparedness, planning, and response capabilities. While terrorism medicine is slowly finding its way into medical curricula and hospitals are starting to make efforts to prepare, questions remain, not the least of which is how to decide how much time to take away from the day-to-day business of patient care to spend preparing for something that might happen sometime in the future. Failure to respond will not be an option, so hospitals and patient care providers need to begin thinking about their roles in responding to disasters, and the coordination, plans, education and training, and additional actions that will shape their ability to provide the necessary assistance if the need arises.</br>
