Associate Professor of Decision Sciences, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, F-77300, France, philippe.delquie@insead.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Generalizing a previous result: The value of information about any and all alternatives of a decision situation is maximum when the decisionmaker is indifferent between the alternatives, and it vanishes as preference for one alternative gets stronger. This is true for any correlation structure among alternatives, utility function, and (random) wealth. This permits to define an Intrinsic Value of Information for any lottery: a measure of information value independent of the decision context.</br>
