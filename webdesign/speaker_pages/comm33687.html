Title: So You Want to Save the World?  Opportunities in HIV Prevention and Treatment Policy Modeling<br>Author: Margaret Brandeau, Professor, Stanford University, MS&E Department, Terman Building, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, brandeau@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We provide an overview of important current challenges in HIV prevention and treatment, and we outline promising areas where OR modeling can have an impact on policy.  These include treatment and control of coepidemics; determining the appropriate allocation of limited resources between HIV prevention versus treatment; evaluating HIV interventions tailored to specific regions of the world; and addressing logistical issues that arise in the scaleup of prevention and treatment programs.
