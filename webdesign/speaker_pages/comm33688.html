Title: Dynamic Pricing in the Presence of Demand Shocks: Hedging Point Policies<br>Author: Omar Besbes, Assistant Professor, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, 545 JMHH, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, obesbes@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Assaf Zeevi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a dynamic pricing problem in the presence of changes in the demand environment. In particular, we analyze the trade-off between future (uncertain) sales and instantaneous sales. The latter is seen to be an interplay between resource constraints and   uncertainty with regard to the future demand model.
