Title: Autonomous Reconfigurability of the National Air Transportation System<br>Author: Constantine Caramanis, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept, Austin, TX, United States of America, cmcaram@ece.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Barnhart, Georgia Perakis, Dimitris Bertsimas<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This talk describes a vision for the autonomous Reconfigurability of the National Air Transportation System in response to the prevailing demand-to-capacity relationship at any given time. We focus on recent optimization-based results whose salient features include: (a) equity models mirroring industry standards, (b) national-scale computations, and (c) models and results for multiple-agent interactions, in particular the FAA¢s slot allocation and subsequent airline recovery operations.
