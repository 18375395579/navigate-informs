<br>Title: Connecting a Fixed Guideway System to the Network</br><br>Author: Nicholas Lownes, Assistant Professor, University of Connecticut, 261 Glenbrook Road U 2037, Storrs, CT, United States of America, nlownes@engr.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei (David) Fan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Fixed-guideway transit systems (heavy, light, commuter rail and BRT systems) have in many places led to improvements in not only mobility, but in social cohesion and economic development.  To harness these benefits the fixed-guideway system must be well connected to the existing network and the served communities.  This paper investigates the sensitivity of circulator/distributor routing to operator and user costs.</br>
