Title: Don’t Ask My Personal Information Too Much: Consumer’s Personal Information Disclosure Behavior on the Web<br>Author: Dan Kim, Associate Professor, University of Houston - Clear Lake, 2700 Bay Area Blvd, Houston, TX, 77058, United States of America, KimDan@UHCL.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The present study proposes a research framework including factors which affect an Internet consumer’s personal information disclosure decision. Drawing upon previous literature, we adopt three factors (i.e., Consumer Trust, Perceived Value, and Perceived Risk) affecting the decision. Along with these three factors, we propose another cost factor (i.e., Perceived Irksomeness) which is accompanied by the labor of filling in or typing in personal information.
