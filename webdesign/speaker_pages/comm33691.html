<br>Title: Multi-Shore Sourcing of Judgment and Expertise-Intensive Services: Evidence From Field Research</br><br>Author: Ravi Aron, Assistant Professor, The Wharton School, 545 Jon M. Huntsman Hall, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, raviaron@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Annapurna Valluri, Lyle Ungar</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Based on panel data collected from providers of multi-shore research and show that providers (firms) that use deep-linked inter-organizational information systems are able to migrate their buyers away from costly synchronous channels of communication (telephone, in-person) towards asynchronous channels that are less costly and over a period of time, more effective. Finally, we also study the factors that are best predictors of what makes ad-hoc sourcers convert to contractual sourcing.</br>
