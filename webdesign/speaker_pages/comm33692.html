Title: The WEEE-directive Revised? Alternative Measures for Sustainable Recovery<br>Author: Rob Zuidwijk, Associate Professor, Rotterdam School of Management - Erasmus University, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, NA, 3062PA, Netherlands, RZuidwijk@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Harold Krikke<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: According to the European directive on Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment, all member states must have an operational End Of Life recovery system. We present an analytical model to study the impacts of the directive and other policy measures on Pareto optimal recovery strategies in terms of energy production and economic revenues. We apply the model to five product categories and observe that the directive is often ineffective or counterproductive. We explore alternative policy measures.
