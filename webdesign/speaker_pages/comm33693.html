Title: Liquidity Risk in Dynamic Portfolio Optimization<br>Author: John R. Birge, Jerry W. and Carol Lee Levin Professor, University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business, 5807 S. Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States, john.birge@chicagogsb.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Liquidity poses a challenge for dynamic portfolio optimization due to potential non-convexities and state complexity, caused for example by vesting periods, varying lock-out restrictions, and advance-notice requirements. Ignoring liquidity concerns, especially no-trade constraints, can also lead to substantial sub-optimality. This talk considers the nature of the solution differences from liquidity risks and approximations of the state and value function that allow for efficient computation.
