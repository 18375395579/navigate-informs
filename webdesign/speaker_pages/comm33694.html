Title: Discrete Choice Models for Dynamic Decisions<br>Author: So Yeon Chun, Assistant Professor, Georgetown University, McDonough School of Business, 37th and O Streets, Washington DC, 20057, United States of America, sc1286@georgetown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anton Kleywegt<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Traditional discrete choice models assume that decision makers choose one alternative at a point in time, without the option to wait, collect more data, and revisit the decision later. We formulate a discrete choice model in which, at each decision time, decision makers have the option to postpone a decision until later. Alternatives and attributes may change over time, and decision makers attempt to forecast attribute values at the next decision time.
