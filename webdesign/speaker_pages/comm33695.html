Title: Managing Changes in Service Networks<br>Author: Kamal Bhattacharya, Research Staff Member, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, 19 Skyline Dr, Hawthorne, NY, 10532, United States of America, kamalb@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Services are a means to provide value to consumers and are often realized through processes hosted on applications. Current discovery technologies map out dependencies between individual applications and assess change impact. Yet there is a lack of understanding of the impact of change on specific processes hosted by one or more applications. We will illustrate some basics of service networks design and present a model for assessing the risk of changes under financial and structural constraints.
