We searched internally to recognize and validate areas that contribute to over-spending. Research areas focused on time deltas: planning to booking, booking to travel, and advanced airfare purchase. By modeling travel procedures and analyzing corresponding data, we discovered streamlining opportunities that could lessen excessive travel costs.
