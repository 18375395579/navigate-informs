Title: Evaluation of HIV Treatment Policies in Resource Poor Environments<br>Author: Robert Koppenhaver, PhD Student, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, rzk9@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, R. Scott Braithwaite, Mark Roberts<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a closed population of HIV infected patients. In resource poor environments, decision makers must allocate antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to patients in need of them the most. Further complicating matters is that once a patient is given ARVs, the decision maker must decide when to deny further access to ARVs. We compare various methods for determining which patients should receive ARVs and when to switch a patient off of ARVs.
