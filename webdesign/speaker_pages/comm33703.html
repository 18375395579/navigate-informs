Title: Why We Need AHP/ANP in this World<br>Author: Eizo Kinoshita, Dean/Professor, Meijo University, 4-3-3,Nijigaoka, Kani, 509-0261, Japan, kinoshit@urban.meijo-u.ac.jp<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper treats human decision making from the perspective of rationality, and defines a Utility Function and Utility Theory as an instrumentally rational decision making theory and AHP as a procedurally rational decision making theory. We show that in practice it is more effective to use the AHP. In this paper we present a partial interpretation of a lasting debate on the effectiveness of Utility Function and the AHP, a debate that does not seem to be ending anytime soon.
