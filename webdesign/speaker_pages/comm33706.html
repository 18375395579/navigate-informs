Shimada, Susan S. Woods, Sharon Johnson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Secure messaging (SM), electronic and asynchronous communication between patients and healthcare teams, is a core function of personal health records systems. We examine SM patterns in two medical centers. Understanding these patterns allows obstacles and facilitators of SM use to be identified, and provides opportunities for improving care delivery at the operations and policy level.
