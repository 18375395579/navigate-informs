This has resulted in an important labor gap in an industry highly dependent on migrant farm laborers. The H2A visa allows farmers to bring foreign temporary workers. To get this Visa, farmers need to show that the local labor pool will not be affected by these immigrants. We present optimization models that render optimal levels of immigrant workers that complement the existing local labor force.
