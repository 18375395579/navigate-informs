<br>Title: Engineering for Efficient, Effective, Equitable Decisions in Public Health</br><br>Author: Julie Swann, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, jswann@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many opportunities exist to engineer more efficient, effective, and equitable decisions in public health, which is the “science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health?within and across populations.  We will present examples of work with or for public health collaborators 1) linking disease modeling with decision support 2) administering or distributing vaccines effectively, and 3) connecting health access with outcomes and appropriate interventions.  Challenges and strategies for success will be discussed.</br>
