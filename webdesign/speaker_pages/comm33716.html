<br>Title: Workforce Planning Models with Individual Worker Differences</br><br>Author: Esma Gel, Associate Professor, Arizona State University, Dept of Industrial Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, Esma.Gel@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Fowler, Pornsarun Wirojanagud</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss formulations and efficient solution methods for workforce planning. In particular, we consider individual worker differences and a variety of decisions such as hiring, firing, cross-training and the use of contingent workers. Our results demonstrate the importance of modeling worker differences as well as the effectiveness of our heuristics.</br>
