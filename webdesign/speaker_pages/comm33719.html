<br>Title: An Interpersonal Influence Representation in Social Network Flow Modeling</br><br>Author: Jonathan Hamill, USAF/AFIT, 2950 Hobson Way, WPAFB, OH, 45434, United States, thehamills@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Chrissis, Robert Mills, Richard Deckro</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Methods to measure the strength of interpersonal ties among individuals in a social network as well as a means to mathematically characterize source-dependent influence are presented. These techniques lend themselves to use of classic network flow formulations, to include a new centrality measure based upon generalized network flows.</br>
