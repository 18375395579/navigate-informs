Title: Evidence Contrary to the Statistical View of Boosting<br>Author: David Mease, Assistant Professor, San Jose State University, mease_d@cob.sjsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abraham Wyner<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The statistical perspective on boosting focuses on optimization, drawing parallels with logistic regression.  We present empirical evidence that raises questions about this view.  Although the statistical perspective provides a theoretical framework within which it is possible to derive theorems and create new algorithms for general contexts, we show that there remain many unanswered important questions.
