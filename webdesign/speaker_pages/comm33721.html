Title: Autonomous Vehicles and Intersection Auctions: Efficiency and Equity<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, 301 E Dean Keeton St Stop C1761, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Levin, Dustin Carlino, Peter Stone<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles admit new mechanisms for managing intersections  and pricing travel choices, including decentralized auction-based  intersection control.  Simulation experiments are used to explore the  relationships between total travel time, travel time impacts by value  of time, and equity among travelers with different willingness to pay,  as auction parameters are varied.
