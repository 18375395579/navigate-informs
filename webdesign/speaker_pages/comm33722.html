<br>Title: OR and Public Policy in the Large and in the Small: Linking Models to Outcomes</br><br>Author: Michael Johnson, PhD, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Boston, 100 Morrissey Blvd., Dept of Public Policy and Public Affairs, Boston, MA, 02124, United States of America, michael.johnson@umb.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: OR/MS is well-suited for applications in which problems are easily quantified, objectives are commonly understood and decisions can be implemented quickly. However, public-sector problems often face political and administrative barriers in implementation, and uncertainty about the impact of solutions on social outcomes. I review applications in community-based OR and humanitarian logistics that address these difficulties, and suggest ways that OR can maximize its contributions to public affairs.</br>
