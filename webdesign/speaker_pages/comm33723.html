<br>Title: A Design-centric View of the Economy</br><br>Author: Carliss Baldwin, Professor, Harvard Business School, Baker Library 355, Boston, MA, United States of America, cbaldwin@hbs.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Designs are the instructions based on knowledge that turn resources into things that people use and value. All goods and services have designs, and a new design lies behind every innovation. I argue that designs—sometimes called recipes (Nelson and Winter) or prescriptive knowledge (Mokyr)—are a special kind of knowledge deserving of focused attention by scholars of innovation.          In the first place, all innovation rests on new designs. An innovation is, by definition, a new design that has been realized, that is, turned into a new product or process.   In the second place, designs have observable structures (architecture). Their structure can be mapped in terms of hierarchies of modules with coordinating interfaces. Design structure influences (but is also influenced by) the organization of firms and the economy, including the location and design of transactions.  Thirdly, the unit of change or innovation is not an entire product, process or system, but a module within the product, process or system. Modules are “units of a larger system whose elements are powerfully connected among themselves and relatively weakly connected to elements in other units.?Thus it is relatively easy to substitute one module design for another without changing other parts of the system. As a result, modules carry option value, which in turn provides incentives for to invest resources in innovative effort.          Investigating the modular structure of designs, the option value of modules, and how different institutions support or impede the evolution of complex designs is an exciting, open avenue of inquiry in the study of technological change and innovation.</br>
