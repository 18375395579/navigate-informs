We use a comprehensive dataset of 39,600+ patient visits across outpatient clinics of 72 hospitals in North Texas from 2005 to 2012. Our results suggest that hospital switching is significantly and positively associated with duplicate testing. Our results support the need to implement health information exchanges to share patient medical data across hospitals and reduce waste.</br>
