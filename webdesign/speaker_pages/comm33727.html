<br>Title: Behavioral Experiments in Dual Sales Channel Management</br><br>Author: Murat Kaya, Sabanci University, Tuzla, Istanbul, TR, Turkey, mkaya@sabanciuniv.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kay-Yut Chen, Ozalp Ozer</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop a model to determine effective dual (online and retail) sales channel strategies. We also conducted behavioral experiments with human subjects and study whether the model’s predictions are consistent with human behavior. We determine risk aversion as an important behavioral factor. We also determine optimal pricing strategies that take into consideration behavioral issues. To do so, we extend the model to account for risk aversion with mean-variance trade-off.</br>
