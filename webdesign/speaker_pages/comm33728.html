Title: We Will Be Right with You: Managing Customers with Vague Promises<br>Author: Gad Allon, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, g-allon@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Achal Bassamboo, Itay Gurvich<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Delay announcements informing customers about anticipated service delays are prevalent in service-oriented systems. We examine this problem of information communication by considering a model in which both the firm and the customers act strategically: the firm in choosing announcements, and the customers in interpreting the announcements and in making the decision when to join and when to balk. We characterize the equilibrium language that emerges between the service provider and her customers.
