Title: The Siren Call of Difficult Tasks: Career Concerns and Operational Autonomy<br>Author: Enno Siemsen, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 350 Wohlers Hall, 1206 S. Sixth Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States, siemsen@uiuc.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine how economic incentives can lead agents to prefer difficult tasks to simple ones. We model a decision context in which agents have the operational autonomy to choose between easy or more difficult solutions to their task. We demonstrate that highly capable agents prefer moderately difficult tasks to showcase their capability, while less-capable agents prefer highly difficult tasks to mask their lack of capability.
