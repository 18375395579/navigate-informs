<br>Title: On Optimality and Equivalency of Test Plans</br><br>Author: Elsayed Elsayed, Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, New Brunswick, NJ, 08854, United States of America, elsayed@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yada Zhu, Michael Koskulics, Chen Li</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The accuracy of reliability predictions depends on the design of optimum test plans. Since there is a wide range of reliability testing plans with different types of stresses and stress application methods it becomes important to explore the optimality of test plans as well as their equivalency.  This paper addresses both optimality and equivalency of test plans under different conditions.</br>
