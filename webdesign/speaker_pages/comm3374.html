<br>Title: Foreclosed Housing Development Strategy Design Using Value-focused Thinking Methods</br><br>Author: Michael Johnson, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Boston, Dept of Public Policy & Public Affairs, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA, 02125, United States of America, michael.johnson@umb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rachel Drew, Jeff Keisler, David Turcotte</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Community-based organizations often have trouble designing strategies that link achievement of organizational goals to specific actions. We apply value-focused thinking and decision analysis methods to clarify priorities in order to develop and rank strategies for foreclosed housing redevelopment in three urban CBOs. Results and sensitivity analyses illustrate differences across missions and service area characteristics.</br>
