Title: Equivalence of Accelerated Testing Plans<br>Author: Elsayed Elsayed, Professor, Department of Industrial and System Engineering, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854-8018, United States, elsayed@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hao Zhang, Haitao Liao<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this presentation we present approaches for assessing the equivalence between two different accelerated test plans. We focus on constant stress plans and the simple step-stress test plans and determine the parameters of each plan that will make the two plans equivalent. The parameters include the stress levels, allocations of test units to the applied stresses and the duration of the test.
