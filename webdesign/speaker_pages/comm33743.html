Title: Some Implications of Institutional Pluralism<br>Author: Matt Kraatz, College of Business, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, kraatz@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Emily Block<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper elaborates some of the organizational implications of institutional pluralism.  Institutional pluralism is the condition confronted by organizations that operate within more than one institutional sphere at the same time.  Organizations in pluralistic contexts have multiple roles, obligations, and social identities which are bestowed upon them as a result of their multiple institutional affiliations.  We discuss the challenges and opportunities that pluralism creates for the organization and also consider its implications for theory.
