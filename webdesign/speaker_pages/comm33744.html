Instead, activities that mitigate these risks largely focus on reducing, managing, or limiting the consequences of biological events once they begin to occur.  To do this effectively requires the earliest possible warning that an event is occurring, as well as continuing shared situational awareness  throughout the event, to enable effective decision making regarding what management actions should be taken.    In this presentation, we will describe the mission and activities of the National Biosurveillance Integration Center within DHS, charged with enabling early warning and providing shared situational awareness for biological events of national concern, focusing on a variety of new pilot projects that apply advanced analytics to integrate multiple streams of data.  Specifically, real-time biosurveillance-relevant data such EMS, Emergency Department, 911, Poison Control information, and social media are all currently being developed for biosurveillance applications through advanced analytics and visualization.</br>
