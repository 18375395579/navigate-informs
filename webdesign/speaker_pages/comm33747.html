Using data from 451 stores over two years of a large U.S. retailer, we show that the labor-mix of temporary workers exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship with store profitability and temporary labor-mix is related to lower values of service quality. We also find that employee engagement positively moderates the negative relationship between temporary labor mix and service quality.</br>
