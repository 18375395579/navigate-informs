<br>Title: Allocation Policies in Blood Transfusion</br><br>Author: Vahid Sarhangian, University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management, 105 St.George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S3E6, Canada, Vahid.Sarhangian11@Rotman.Utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Opher Baron, Hossein Abouee Mehrizi, Oded Berman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Recent studies suggest an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients receiving transfusions of older blood.  In order to investigate the potential of allocation policies in reducing the age of transfused blood without significantly affecting its availability, we analyze an idealized model of the blood bank of a hospital and consider a family of allocation policies. This allows us to quantify the outcome of policies and assess their benefits.</br>
