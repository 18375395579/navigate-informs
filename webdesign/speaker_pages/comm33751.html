Fowler Ave., Tampa, Fl, 33620, United States of America, chaitrag@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tapas Das</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Performance of a populations cancer care system is dependent on the behavior of a number of independent decision making agents, like patients, service providers, and insurers, whose goals could sometimes be conflicting. The objective of the research is to develop a prototype cyber enabled multi-agent simulation decision model. The prototype, demonstrated on CRC care system of Indiana, will serve as a decision tool for analyzing intervention strategies for early detection of CRC.</br>
