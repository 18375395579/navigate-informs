Title: A Multi-agent Modeling Approach to Decision Making for Intervention of Colorectal Cancer Care (CRC)<br>Author: Chaitra Gopalappa, Student, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Ave., Tampa, Fl, 33620, United States of America, chaitrag@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Tapas Das<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Performance of a populations cancer care system is dependent on the behavior of a number of independent decision making agents, like patients, service providers, and insurers, whose goals could sometimes be conflicting. The objective of the research is to develop a prototype cyber enabled multi-agent simulation decision model. The prototype, demonstrated on CRC care system of Indiana, will serve as a decision tool for analyzing intervention strategies for early detection of CRC.
