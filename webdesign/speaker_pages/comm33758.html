<br>Title: Network Externality in Allocation of Point-of-care (POC) Diagnostic Tests in Developing Countries</br><br>Author: Sarang Deo, Assistant Professor, Indian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, 500032, India, Sarang_Deo@isb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Milind Sohoni</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: POC diagnostic devices aim to eliminate diagnostic delays and improve patient retention in developing countries. We develop an optimization model for the allocation of a limited number of devices over a network of clinics. We study the impact of network externality ?allocation to one clinic changes the delay experienced at other clinics ?which is not accounted for in simple thumb rules used in practice. We apply our results to an infant HIV diagnosis program in a sub-Saharan country.</br>
