Title: On the Theory of Information Accuracy: Information Sources and their Knowledge Structures<br>Author: Eugene Perevalov, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, eup2@lehigh.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The classical Information Theory found a consistent way to describe information quantity regardless of its content. This made it a theoretical foundation of optimal transmission. On the other hand, to obtain a similar theoretical foundation of information acquisition and usage, it is necessary to find ways to describe information accuracy and relevance. We address the former information characteristic and discuss how a theory of optimal information acquisition can be developed.
