<br>Title: Problem Formulation and Solution in Humanitarian Transportation Planning</br><br>Author: Erica Gralla, Assistant Professor, The George Washington University, 1776 G Street Suite 101, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, egralla@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jarrod Goentzel, Charles Fine</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In many important operational settings, human decision-makers struggle not only to make good decisions but also to understand the nature, or formulation, of the decision itself. We study ten teams of expert humanitarian logisticians, to show the mechanisms by which humans formulate problems, and discuss their impact on the quality of their solutions. We find that humans employ search within a limited problem space defined by sensemaking, guided by goal-oriented decision rules.</br>
