Title: Automatic Identification Technology for Arms Room Management<br>Author: John Willis, Assistant Professor, US Military Academy, Department of Systems Engineering, Mahan Hall, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, john.willis@usma.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Current arms room management systems are not positioned to provide reporting or inventory control beyond the level of the individual arms room nor are there opportunities to integrate the arms room into other activities. This paper describes the use of proven automatic identification technology (AIT) and supporting software/hardware to automate the personnel identification and sensitive item issue, turn-in, and inventory processes.
