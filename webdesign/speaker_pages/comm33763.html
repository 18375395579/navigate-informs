<br>Title: Telling the “Hot?from the “Not? Online Content Recommendations on the Internet</br><br>Author: Yonatan Gur, Columbia Business School, New York, NY, United States of America, ygur14@gsb.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Omar Besbes, Assaf Zeevi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A new class of online services allows publishers to direct readers to other web-based content they may be interested in. We study this dynamic recommendation problem, focusing on challenges introduced by the massive stream of new content and the short shelf-life of articles, and focusing on topic-based popularity as basis for recommendations. Work is based on collaboration with a leading provider of online content recommendations.</br>
