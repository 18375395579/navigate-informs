Title: Corporate Investment Behaviour under Climate Change Policy Risk<br>Author: Janne Kettunen, London Business School, Regents Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, jkettunen@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Blyth, Derek Bunn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We analyze the effects of policy and regulatory risk on investment behavior in the electricity sector. We derive a multistage stochastic optimization model with uncertainty in carbon price. We demonstrate how the effects of various carbon policies and market instruments on investment can depend on the characteristics of the companies, and therefore may promote market structure as well as technology change.
