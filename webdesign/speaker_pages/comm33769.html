<br>Title: How Does Organization Structure Affect Supply Chain Performance?</br><br>Author: Anupam Agrawal, University of Illinois, 363 Wohlers Hall, Champaign, IL, 61821, United States of America, anupam@illinois.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We explore a detailed real life experiment in which a firm had different organizational structures in its two divisions, and these different structures infuenced the quality of the sourced components in the two divisions differently. We show how buyer organization redesign   can create a learning environment at the suppliers, and if this redesign is not done, then the learning environment and thereby the incoming quality can be different.</br>
