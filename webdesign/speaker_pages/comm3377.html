<br>Title: Exploring the Role of Culture in Psychological Safety and Team Learning</br><br>Author: Mary Zellmer-Bruhn, Associate Professor, University of Minnesota, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, 55455, United States of America, zellm002@umn.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Psychological safety is vital to internal and external team learning. Given differences in behavioral expectations across cultures, evidence that work-related constructs may carry different meaning across cultures, and increases in globally distributed work, examining psychological safety in different cultural settings is a valuable avenue for research. This paper presents an exploratory framework for the role of culture and language differences in team psychological safety.</br>
