Title: Strategic Information Transmission in Service Systems<br>Author: Achal Bassamboo, Northwestern University, a-bassamboo@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gad Allon, Itai Gurvich<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many call center use recorded announcements that encourage callers to wait for an agent to become available, or describe the current state of the system. We study a model of interaction between the customers and the service provider, in a setting where their incentives are misaligned, and where unverifiable, costless and non-binding information can be provided to the customer by the service provider.
