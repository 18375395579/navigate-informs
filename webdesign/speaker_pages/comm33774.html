Box 4288, Incline Village, NV, 89450, United States of America, daniel@solver.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This talk will recount the creation of the first spreadsheet program, VisiCalc, on the Apple II in 1979, including its development and marketing.  At the time, experts believed that the need for financial planning and modeling software was fully served by several large competitors, with powerful systems offered through time-sharing.
