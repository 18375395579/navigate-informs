Title: Bridging Organizational Scales with a Multiscale Decision-Making Model<br>Author: Christian Wernz, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 160 Governors Drive, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, cwernz@ecs.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abhijit Deshmukh<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: An agent's decision influences other agents and their decisions across all levels in an organization. Our model captures and analyzes multiscale effects that occur in hierarchical organizations. The agents' interaction is represented with dependency graphs and analyzed using phase diagrams and Nash equilibria. Results show how to improve the decision-making capabilities of agents, how to reduce information exchange needs, and determine organizational design that motivates cooperative behavior.
