Evans, Phani Polina<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk, we will present a real-time decision support system (RTDSS) that can be used by emergency coordinators during a medical emergency, e.g., pandemic influenza attack. The RTDSS has two sets of tools - status and tracking tools as well as planning and analysis tools. Several modules embedded in the latter set of tools for resource allocation, vaccination planning, emergency department planning, and ambulance assignment are discussed.
