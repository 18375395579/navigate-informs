Title: Managing Customer-Induced Variability in Service Operations: the Role of Requisite Variety<br>Author: Enrico Secchi, Assistant Professor, University of Victoria, PO Box 1700 STN CSC, Victoria, BC, V8W 2Y2, Canada, esecchi@uvic.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Aleda Roth, Rohit Verma<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine the influence of service improvisation on various types of customer-induced variability. Using a sample of hotel managers, we test the effectiveness of such service operations strategies. We show that empowering employees to deviate from standard processes (i.e., improvising) is cost-effective in some service types but counterproductive in others.
