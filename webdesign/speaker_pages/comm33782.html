Title: Discharge Planning to Mitigate Bed Block and ER Overcrowding<br>Author: Rene Bekker, VU University Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1081a, Amsterdam, Netherlands, r.bekker@vu.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Helm, Mark Van Oyen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Bed block in hospitals leads to long waits in Emergency Department, patients being placed in the hallways on stretchers, poor quality of care, high costs and mortalities. The timing of discharges from inpatient beds significantly impacts bed block, as the mismatch between arrivals and discharges over the day typically leads to a mid-day spike. This research models the intra-day census process and discharge timing and investigates how hospital characteristics impact bed blocking.
