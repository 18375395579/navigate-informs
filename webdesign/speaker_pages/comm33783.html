Title: Dynamic Research Capacity Allocation in a R&D Pipeline<br>Author: Yi Xu, Assistant Professor, University of Miami, 412B Jenkins Bldg., 5250 University Dr., Coral Gables, FL, 33146, United States, yxu@miami.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yong-Pin Zhou<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper studies a R&D intensive firm’s dynamic capacity allocation policy to maintain an efficient R&D pipeline. The firm needs to allocate its research capacity among a set of project classes. We characterize the optimal policy and explore how factors such as risk aversion, diminishing return, and interactions among different project classes could affect the optimal policy. We also discuss the relationships between our model and R&D and financial portfolio management techniques.
