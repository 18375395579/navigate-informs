Title: Dynamic Content Recommendations: Optimizing Path-wise Performance<br>Author: Yonatan Gur, Columbia University, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, ygur14@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Assaf Zeevi, Omar Besbes<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A new class of online services allows publishers to direct readers to other web-based content they may be interested in. We study this dynamic recommendation problem and its rapidly changing, ``big-data?environment. We develop a representation of content along two key dimensions, based on which we propose a class of user-path focused heuristics. Work is based on collaboration with a leading provider of online content recommendations.
