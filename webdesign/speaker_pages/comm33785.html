Title: Working Capital Constraints and Inventory<br>Author: Yale T. Herer, Technion ?Israel Institute of Technology, Israel, yale@technion.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Enver Yücesan, Illana Bendavid<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Curiously absent from the inventory operations literature are models    that consider financial constraints imposed by working capital requirements  (WCR). In practice, however, many firms are self-financing, i.e.,    their ability to replenish their own inventories is directly affected not    only by their current inventory levels, but also by their receivables and    payables. In this paper, we analyze the materials management practices of a  self-financing firm whose replenishment decisions are constrained by    cash flows. In particular, we investigate the interaction between the    financial and operational parameters as well as the impact of WCR constraints    on the long-run average cost.
