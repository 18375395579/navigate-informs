Title: Service Delivery Financial Performance<br>Author: Ray Strong, IBM Research Almaden, 650 Harry Rd, San Jose, CA, 95120, United States of America, hrstrong@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jeanette Blomberg, Sechan Oh, Neil Boyette, Anca Chandra<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present anonymized and normalized evidence for hypotheses about cost and revenue behavior in long term IT service delivery contracts. For example, we provide support for the declining volatility of cost over project lifetimes. We discuss how we collect and analyze the raw data and the status of several hypotheses relevant to forecasting profitability. We also discuss how we draw conclusions from data generated by accounting practices that change over time.
