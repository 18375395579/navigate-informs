<br>Title: RGGI, Carbon Leakage, and the Influence of Border Measures</br><br>Author: Marek Kolodziej, Ph.D Student, Geography and Environment, Boston University, 12 Beacon Ter. Apt. 2, Somerville, MA, 02143, United States, marek@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ian Sue Wing</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative seeks to cap emissions of CO2 from power plants in 9 states starting in 2009. Like other sub-global initiatives, RGGI may result in carbon leakage due to the relocation of power generation and energy-intensive production to non-signatory regions. We analyze this issue by (1) illustrating the channels of leakage, (2) quantifying the leakage and macroeconomic impacts using a CGE model, and (3) evaluating the effectiveness of measures to neutralize leakage.</br>
