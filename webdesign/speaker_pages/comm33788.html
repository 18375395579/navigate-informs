Title: Insights from the Development of the Behavior-robust Adaptive EvacuationTraffic Management<br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E 2nd St. Room 206, Department of Civil Eng.and Eng. Mech., Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, chiu@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pitu Mirchandani<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Real-world route choice behavior during evacuation has not been fully understood. Most existing models, descriptive or prescriptive in nature, do not necessarily produce accurate performance measures due to the lack of realism in the evacuation route choice behavior modeling. In this talk we attempt to shed the light on how adaptive traffic management strategy could lead to robust evacuation performance regardless of the lack of accurate behavior modeling capability.
