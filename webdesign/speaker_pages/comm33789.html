Title: The Impact of Winner Information on the Competitive Bidding in B2B Sequential Dutch Auctions<br>Author: Wolf Ketter, Associate Professor, Erasmus University, Rotterdam School of Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands, WKetter@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Eric van Heck, Alok Gupta, Yixin Lu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We conduct a field experiment to study how changes in the availability of winner information influence bidders?decisions and overall outcomes in a complex B2B market. We find that public signals related to winner ID have positive effects on tacit collusion. This suggests that auctioneers should not communicate winner ID to the bidders in the sequential auctions in order to deter future collusion.
