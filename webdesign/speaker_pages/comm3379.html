Title: Patients without Patience: An Econometric Model of Waiting in the Intensive Care Unit<br>Author: Elisa Long, UCLA Anderson School of Management, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States of America, elisa.long@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kusum Mathews<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: High utilization levels in the hospital intensive care unit (ICU) and other hospital departments may impact patients?length of stay and thus contribute to long wait times for a bed. Using 12 months of data for Yale-New Haven Hospital (a 51-bed ICU), we develop an econometric model to estimate the impact of crowdedness on length of stay and bed transfer time, and the subsequent impact of waiting on mortality and readmission rates.
