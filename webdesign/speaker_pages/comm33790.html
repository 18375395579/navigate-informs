Title: Integrating Organizational, Decision-Making, and Problem-Solving Perspectives of Scheduling<br>Author: Jeffrey Herrmann, Professor, University of Maryland, Department of Mechanical Engineering, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, jwh2@umd.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Production scheduling activities are common but complex.  This leads to many different perspectives.  Each has a particular scope, its own set of assumptions, and a different approach to improving production scheduling.  Three important perspectives are the problem-solving perspective, the decision-making perspective, and the organizational perspective.  This talk presents an integrative strategy for selecting, in a particular setting, an approach for improving production scheduling.
