Title: R&D Investment Dynamics under Uncertainty: Theory and Application<br>Author: Tao Yao, Assistant Professor, The Pennsylvania State University, 349 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, taoyao@psu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Strategic R&D Investment under Uncertainty: Collusion and Information Time Lag. Introduce collusion equilibrium under the repeated strategic interactions. Explain several otherwise puzzling innovation market phenomena. Analyze the likelihood of tacit collusion in R&D and note implications for antitrust and merger control. Dynamic R&D Project Selection. Project selection decisions under uncertainty are often made sequentially. Use repeated options to derive optimal rules. Illustrate with a Hybrid Electric Cars vs. Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles example as pursued by GM.
