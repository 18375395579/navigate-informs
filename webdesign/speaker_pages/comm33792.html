Title: Corporate Social Responsibility, Investment, and Performance<br>Author: Trisha Anderson, Assistant Professor, Texas Wesleyan University, 1200 Wesleyan St., Fort Worth, TX, 76105, United States of America, trdanderson@txwes.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A company’s financial strength (doing good in the market place) is based on the social reputation of the company. We study the level of corporate social responsibility and performance in various investment factors for different industries from 1991-2010.  We investigate the organizational level of involvement in each investment factor over time, the relationship between the investment factors, and validate the distribution of the investment factors to be used for modeling.
