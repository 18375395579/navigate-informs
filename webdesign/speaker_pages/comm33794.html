<br>Title: Toward Info Accounting in Prediction Markets</br><br>Author: Robin Hanson, Associate Professor of Economics, George Mason University, MSN 1D3, Carow Hall,, Fairfax, VA, 22015, United States of America, rhanson@gmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Prediction market business cases need numerical estimates not only of costs, but also of business value.  This requires estimates not only of accuracy improvements, but also of the associated value of information.  Organizations will also need ways to estimate the value contributed by particular traders.  Grounded in concrete examples, I consider possible approaches to these information accounting tasks.</br>
