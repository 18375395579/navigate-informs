It examines the spatial pattern of innovation in rare earth applications from 1976 to 2002. It finds that rare earth catalyst innovation activities expand globally, while rare earth magnet innovation activities become more clustered and that these responses are conditioned by the role of geographic within value chain knowledge.</br>
