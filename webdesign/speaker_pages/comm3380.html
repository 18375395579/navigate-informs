<br>Title: Automatic Fine-tuning Xpress-MP to Solve MIP</br><br>Author: Gabriel Tavares, Dash Optimization, part of Fair Isaac, 560 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632, United States of America, gabriel.tavares@dashoptimization.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alkis Vazacopoulos, Horia Tipi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Xpress-Tuner is an automated interactive application that finds an algorithmic strategy consisting of control parameters that allows Xpress to solve a MIP (or a family of MIPs) faster than by using default settings (frequently by a factor of 5-10 times). Xpress-Tuner is non expert-friendly, providing at the same time a wealth of information about the various algorithm choices built into Xpress. We present several examples derived from the industry with a focus on how to tune the MIP heuristics.</br>
