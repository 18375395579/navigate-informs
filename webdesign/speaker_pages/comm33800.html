Title: DrAMPL: A Meta-solver for Optimization<br>Author: Robert Fourer, Northwestern University, Department of Industrial Engineering and Mgt. Science, Evanston, IL, United States of America, 4er@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dominique Orban<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Building upon the AMPL-solver interface library, DrAmpl is a meta-solver for analyzing optimization problems prior to solution.  Its functions include bounding expressions in the decision variables; symbolically proving or numerically disproving convexity of expressions; and using a relational database to suggest appropriate solvers by matching problem characteristics to solvers available on the NEOS Server. We describe the design of DrAmpl, needs that it meets, and perspectives that it offers.
