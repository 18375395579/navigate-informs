However, recent research has revealed that First Call Resolution is also a critical measure of quality and satisfaction.      We develop a framework for multiple queues and agent types, with each agent type having different characteristics across different queues.  We propose routing rules and conduct empirical tests, showing that these rules can be used to increase FCR while simultaneously decreasing waiting times.</br>
