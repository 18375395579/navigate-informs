Title: Outpatient Appointment Scheduling with Uncertainty in Patient Arrivals<br>Author: Denise White, University of Cincinnati, Department of QAOM, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, United States of America, whited5@email.uc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Magazine<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The efficiency and profitability of outpatient clinical operations is often seriously affected by patient arrival variability. The response of the outpatient clinic to early and late arrivals as well as no-show appointments is studied through an empirical simulation of a clinic with extreme variability in patient arrivals. The study examines the effect of various queue disciplines and service prioritizations on patient flow and clinical performance in order to meet operational service targets.
