The response of the outpatient clinic to early and late arrivals as well as no-show appointments is studied through an empirical simulation of a clinic with extreme variability in patient arrivals. The study examines the effect of various queue disciplines and service prioritizations on patient flow and clinical performance in order to meet operational service targets.</br>
