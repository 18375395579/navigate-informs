<br>Title: Riffing: The Multivocality of Innovative Action</br><br>Author: David Obstfeld, Assistant Professor, University of California, Irvine, The Paul Merage School of Business, Irvine, CA, 92697, United States, DObstfel@uci.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Riffing refers to verbal representations by one individual of the voice or lived-in experience of another individual or category of individuals. Riffing is a variant of knowledge articulation whereby knowledge is made more explicit, usable, or relevant to the situation at hand. Field observations in an automotive manufacturer suggest innovation advocates exhibit a propensity to riff and draw from a repertoire of voices to make compelling depictions of existing and envisioned business processes.</br>
