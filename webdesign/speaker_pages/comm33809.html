An effective PM course relates to all business disciplines and therefore is likely to have a greater appeal than most MS courses. In this presentation, we discuss how PM may be the perfect context for introducing business students to MS tools that support and encourage the critical thinking a project manager needs, while stimulating greater interest in other MS courses.</br>
