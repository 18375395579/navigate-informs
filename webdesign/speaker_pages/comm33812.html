Title: An Investigation of Voice-controlled Debugging of Spreadsheets<br>Author: Derek Flood, Dundalk Institute of Technology, Dublin Rd,, Dundalk, Lh, Ireland, Derek.Flood@dkit.ie<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: It is not convenient for all users to control spreadsheets through a keyboard and mouse. With the move towards mobile computer devices and a rise in RSI, alternative systems are receiving much attention. Voice-control(VC) is one approach that has been used successfully. This study is the first to compare experienced spreadsheet developers debugging a spreadsheet using VC with those using a keyboard and mouse. The study showed that voice proved to be slower and resulted in a poorer performance.
