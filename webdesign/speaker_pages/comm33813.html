Title: Rule-based Supply Chain Forecasting and Control<br>Author: Hongrui Liu, Ph.D Student, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering, Box 352650, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, hrliu@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zelda Zabinsky, Wolf Kohn<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop a rule-based method to formulate a stochastic supply chain flow problems that includes forecasting and control.  We explore the use of quantum logic to transform the IF-THEN-ELSE type rules to quantum states and perform inferences with a quantum operator.  This has the potential to drastically reduce computation, so we hope for a real-time efficient methodology for supply chain management.
