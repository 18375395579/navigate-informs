Title: Online User Ratings: When and How Consumers Post and the Effect it Has on Sales<br>Author: Wendy Moe, Associate Professor of Marketing, University of Maryland, 3469 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, wmoe@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Online user ratings and reviews is the number one e-commerce functionality desired by consumers (Forrester 2008).  Therefore, it is not surprising that marketers are investing in this technology or that researchers are studying the effects of ratings on sales.  While existing research has shown a relationship between ratings and sales, several issues remain unaddressed.  The objective of this paper is to model both product sales and posted ratings as two separate but related processes.
