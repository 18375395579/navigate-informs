Title: Partnership and Contracting between Regional Medical Centers and Rural Hospitals via Telemedicine<br>Author: Balaraman Rajan, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States of America, balaraman.rajan@Simon.Rochester.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abraham Seidmann, Rajeev Ramachandran<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We analytically investigate a partnership model between hospitals with the help of telemedicine. Our results explain how telemedicine may not always result in increased competition amongst hospitals serving the same general region but can also aid in forming a mutually beneficial partnership resulting in improved economic and clinical outcomes. While the regional hospitals gain by retaining their patients, medical centers win by being able to see patients who require their level of expertise.
