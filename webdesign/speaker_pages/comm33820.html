<br>Title: Can Stock Price Movements Inform Operational Improvement Efforts? Evidence from the Airline Industry</br><br>Author: Kamalini Ramdas, Associate Professor, University of Virginia, 189 FOB, 100 DArden Blvd, Charlottesville, VA, 22902, United States of America, RamdasK@Darden.virginia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc Lipson, Wei Li, Jonathan Williams</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the use of stock price movements as a source of valuable information on where operations managers should focus their improvement efforts, and demonstrate our approach in the context of airline service quality. Airlines measure service quality along several dimensions. Using 16 years of monthly panel data for the nine major U.S. air carriers, we examine the impact on their stock prices of deviations from predicted performance along each dimension of service quality.</br>
