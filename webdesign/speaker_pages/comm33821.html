The tradeoff theory is generally interpreted to imply that market leverage increases with firm profitability. Empirical studies suggest that the opposite relationship is, however, true, and, therefore, tend to support other explanations including asymmetric information and agency costs. In this talk, we will discuss an alternative based on a news vendor structure and will present empirical results that support this model.</br>
