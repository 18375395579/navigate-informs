<br>Title: Analysis of Economic and Environmental Impact of New Aircraft Concepts via Allocation and Scheduling</br><br>Author: Isaac Tetzloff, Graduate Student, Purdue University, 701 W. Stadium Ave, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, isaact@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Crossley</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Engineering analyses can predict emissions of new aircraft or technologies; however, evaluating their impact on airline profit and the environment at the fleet-level requires studying the interactions between the new aircraft and the airline’s current fleet.  Through the use of an aircraft allocation and scheduling tool, decisions on how to deploy new aircraft technologies and concepts within an airline’s fleet are quickly made while considering both airline profit and environmental impact.</br>
