Title: Optimal Investment in HIV Prevention Programs<br>Author: Arielle Lasry, CDC, 1600 Clifton Rd, MS-E48, Atlanta, GA, 30333, United States of America, alasry@cdc.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Stephanie Sansom L, Katherine A Hicks<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We evaluate the optimal allocation of HIV prevention funds to three high prevalence core populations and to the general adult population in the US. We allocate an annual budget to three targeted prevention interventions and two broad prevention interventions. Results suggest that targeting high prevalence core groups is not necessarily optimal when prevalence across core groups differs widely and the outreach effort associated with targeted interventions is costly.
