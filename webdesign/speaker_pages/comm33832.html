Title: Social Interactions and The Digital Divide: Explaining Variations in Internet Use<br>Author: Ritu Agarwal, University of Maryland, ragarwal@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Animesh Animesh, Kislaya Prasad<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The presence of large variations in Internet use in the U.S. is widely acknowledged.  Prior research suggests that individual, household, and regional differences are responsible for this disparity.  We argue for an alternative explanation: that individual choice is subject to social influence that emanates from geographical proximity, and that such “peer effects?are the cause of the excess variation.  We test this assertion with empirical analysis of a data set of over 21,000 households.
