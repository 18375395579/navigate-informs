We show that the financing costs distort the firm's financing and investment behavior and result in a policy contingent on the dynamics of the cash flow and reserves. Most notably, an intermediate level of cash reserves is likely to accelerate investment in the small-scale project. Our results fill the gap between previous findings.</br>
