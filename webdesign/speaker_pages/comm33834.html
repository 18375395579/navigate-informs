Title: The Rise in Violence in the Late 1980s<br>Author: Alfred Blumstein, H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, ab0q@andrew,cmu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Incarceration doesn’t reduce drug transactions because the resilient market recruits replacements (Blumstein, 1993). The early 1980s saw major growth in incarceration of drug offenders. This did little about drugs, but the nature of the replacements led to a 25% increase in violence, an unintended consequence of the incarceration growth.
