We study this competition as well as other interactions between two policies. Our model describes the U.S. renewable energy portfolio by explicitly accounting for all major renewable energy resources and policy requirements in all states through 2035. Our modeling results were used to address five important questions regarding the impact on the U.S. renewable energy portfolio.</br>
