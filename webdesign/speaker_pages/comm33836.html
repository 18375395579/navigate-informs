These include the introduction of emissions markets, the growth of renewables and ongoing cross border integration (particularly in Europe) via a mechanism called market coupling.  Such key changes provide major obstacles for traditional reduced-form models of power price dynamics.  We discuss these challenges and propose some alternative structural approaches to capturing these new features.</br>
