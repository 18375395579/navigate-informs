By jointly considering intervention and prevention activities, we propose a novel approach to improve health outcome and operational efficiency. We develop a finite horizon MDP model for scheduling diabetic patient visits and composition of prevention and intervention activities. We present results for improving quality of care and efficiency.</br>
