Title: Stochastic Modeling Interface for COIN-OR<br>Author: Alan King, IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center, PO Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, kingaj@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk presents current status and planned initiatives in the open-source COIN-OR respository www.coin-or.org.  COIN-OR now contains a repository for stochastic modeling called Stochastic Modeling Interface, or Smi.  Currently, Smi contains example code that converts (some version of) SMPS format to Open Solver Interface (Osi) compatible solvers -- including Clp, CPLEX, FortMP, GLPK, Mosek, and XPRESS-MP, among others.
