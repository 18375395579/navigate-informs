COIN-OR now contains a repository for stochastic modeling called Stochastic Modeling Interface, or Smi.  Currently, Smi contains example code that converts (some version of) SMPS format to Open Solver Interface (Osi) compatible solvers -- including Clp, CPLEX, FortMP, GLPK, Mosek, and XPRESS-MP, among others.</br>
