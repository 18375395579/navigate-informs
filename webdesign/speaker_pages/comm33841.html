Title: Offshore Outsourcing of Services: A Model of the Extended Organizational Form and Survey Findings<br>Author: Ying Liu, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, yliu@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ravi Aron<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We provide a game-theoretical model of the Extended Organizational Forms (EOF) when the buyer firm outsources processes to a provider with the attendant problems of moral hazard. Constructing all functional forms based on our survey of Business Process Outsourcing contracts in several labor regimes (including the US, UK, Singapore, Mauritius and India), we derive the Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium solutions and comment on the welfare implications of the EOF.
