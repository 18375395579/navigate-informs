One emerging method is to use concept and principles from design thinking. We had an award-winning capstone business consulting course that we knew was no longer getting us the desired results. Using design thinking concepts and principles, we conducted a “deep dive?on our course and developed an entirely new model. We will share the philosophies used and our experiences and lessons learned.  Design thinking can be applied to a wide variety of courses or even modules in virtually any discipline.</br>
