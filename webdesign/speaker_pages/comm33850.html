OR & IT, Al.Mickiewicza 30, Krakow, 30059, Poland, ghsawik@cyf-kr.edu.pl</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A mixed integer programming and conditional value-at-risk are applied for selection of countermeasure portfolio in IT security planning to prevent or mitigate cyber-threats. Given a set of potential threats and a set of available countermeasures, the selection of countermeasures is based on their effectiveness of blocking different threats, implementation costs and probability of potential attack scenarios.</br>
