Title: Learning from What Others Have Learned from You: The Effects of Knowledge Spillovers on Originating Firms<br>Author: Kevin Steensma, University of Washington, steensma@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hongyan Yang, Corey Phelps<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: When an originating firm’s spillovers are recombined with complementary knowledge by recipient firms, a knowledge pool is formed that is inherently related to the originating firm’s knowledge base. This relevant knowledge pool contains valuable opportunities for the originator to vicariously learn from recipients?recombinatorial activities. In a longitudinal study of 87 telecommunications equipment manufacturers, we find that firms with larger relevant knowledge pools that are similar to the firm’s existing knowledge base are more innovative.
