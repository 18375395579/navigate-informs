This relevant knowledge pool contains valuable opportunities for the originator to vicariously learn from recipients?recombinatorial activities. In a longitudinal study of 87 telecommunications equipment manufacturers, we find that firms with larger relevant knowledge pools that are similar to the firm’s existing knowledge base are more innovative.</br>
