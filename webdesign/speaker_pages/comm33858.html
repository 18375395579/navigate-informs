<br>Title: Financing Eco-innovation ?The Determinants of Cooperation to Bridge the Valley of Death</br><br>Author: Friedemann Polzin, EBS Business School Strascheg Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Rheingaustr. 1, Oestrich-Winkel, 65375, Germany, polzin@instoec.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paschen von Flotow, Florian Taeube, Benjamin Weber</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A main obstacle to effective commercialization and diffusion of clean technologies lies in the absent cooperation between financiers and innovators. I conduct expert interviews among project managers and survey stakeholders of government supported cooperative research projects (CRP) to explore this phenomenon. As results I expect a framework for the management of CRP and complementary industrial regulations to reduce information asymmetries in order to mitigate this innovation system failure.</br>
