Ward</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Using the theoretical lens of routines, we investigate the relationships between hospitals' structural characteristics (size & task complexity), infrastructural mechanisms (agency) and initial progression along conformance and experiential quality dimensions of the process of care. Findings reveal that size and complexity are negatively related to simultaneous improvement. However, a partial mediation through agency helps countering this effect.</br>
