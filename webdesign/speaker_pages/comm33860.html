We assessed the cost-effectiveness of universal and risk-factor guided screening for asymptomatic adults followed by one of three treatment strategies. Statistical analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated sex-, race-, age-specific risk factor prevalence and mortality risks. Universal screening is likely cost-effective.
