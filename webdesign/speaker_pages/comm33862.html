Title: Effect of Demand Endogeneity on Firm Level Sales Forecasts<br>Author: Saravanan Kesavan, Doctoral Candidate, Harvard Business School, Soldiers Field Road, Morgan Hall, 428B, Boston, MA, 02163, United States, skesavan@hbs.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vishal Gaur, Ananth Raman<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Firm level sales forecasting is an important activity for retailers. Retailers trade-off mark-ups, inventory and sales in their day-to-day operations. I explore the simultaneity of mark-up, aggregate inventory and sales in past decisions to forecast firm level sales. I use publicly-available financial data to econometrically estimate the simultaneous equations model and test its predictive power.
