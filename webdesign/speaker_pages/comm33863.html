Title: A Retrospective Evaluation of Ground Delay Programs<br>Author: Yi Liu, University of California, Berkeley, 107 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, liuyi.feier@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study establishes five performance criteria for GDP evaluation and specifies performance metrics for each performance goal. Using ADL and ASPM data, historical GDP performance is assessed for SFO and EWR for 2006 and 2011. By defining multiple performance metrics, this research enables FAA traffic managers and flight operators review GDP performance after-the-fact in a comprehensive way and uncover GDP performance trends across airports and over time.
