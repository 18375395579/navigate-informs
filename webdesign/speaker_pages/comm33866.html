Title: Content Sharing in a Social Broadcasting Environment: Evidences from Twitter<br>Author: Huaxia Rui, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States of America, huaxia@utexas.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We collect a detailed dataset about the information-sharing activity on Twitter, called retweet, and estimate an econometric model regarding tie strength and retweeting behavior. The empirical results convincingly support our model and we find that after an author posts a median quality (as defined in the sample) tweet, the likelihood that a unidirectional follower will retweet is significantly higher than the likelihood that a bidirectional follower will.
