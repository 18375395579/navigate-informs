Title: Source Code Not Required: Using the COIN Binaries<br>Author: Kipp Martin, Professor, University of Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States, kipp.martin@chicagogsb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs, JP Fasano<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: COIN-OR provides open-source software for the operations research community. However, many users may wish to take advantage of COIN-OR  without  downloading and compiling source code. There is a COIN-OR project that provides compiled libraries and executables for several key COIN-OR projects. These binaries are available for the Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms.  We describe the available binaries and illustrate how users can link to them and use them for solving optimization problems.
