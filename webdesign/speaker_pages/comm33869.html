Yet, the widespread public awareness of such a disaster will draw the attention of others who are without formal responsibility but have the capacity to lend assistance.  This paper examines the opportunities and risks of providing visual displays of disaster zones to manage needed private allocations of resources for catastrophic disaster recovery.
