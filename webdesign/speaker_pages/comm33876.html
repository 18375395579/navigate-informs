Title: Online Routing in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network<br>Author: Lili Du, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, dul@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Online routing is critical in decentralized Advanced Traveler  Information Systems (ATIS) based on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks  (VANET. VANET provides information of different qualities in  various traffic conditions. This research studies online routing  under Closed-loop Adaptive Routing (CAR) rule in VANET incorporating  the variation of information reliability and time delay.
