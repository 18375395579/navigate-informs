We use the theory of punctuated equilibrium as expressed in the encounter-episode framework to present and make sense of the innovation process. Results suggest that extensive collaboration within and across institutional boundaries, and a combination of technology-push and opportunistic-pull can help create sustainable rural telehealth innovation.</br>
