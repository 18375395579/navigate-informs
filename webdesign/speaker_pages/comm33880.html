We use Multivariate DCC GARCH model to conduct this analysis. We estimate and forecast the dynamic conditional variances and correlations among the demand of shipbuilding, the Baltic Dry Index and some other economic indexes. We find that the dependencies/correlations vary over time, with significant structure changes during the crises periods.
