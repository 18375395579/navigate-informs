Title: Robust Leak Tests for Transmission Systems Using Nonlinear Mixed-Effect Models<br>Author: Kamran Paynabar, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, kamip@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin, John Agapiou, Paula Deeds<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Leakage of the transmission fluid or oil in powertrain systems can cause engine overheating and/or permanent damages. The inspection results of the amount of leakage at given testing times are sensitive to the tested part’s temperature, which varies from part to part but was not previously incorporated in the leak testing systems. The objective of this paper is to develop a robust leak testing system using nonlinear mixed-effect models, which is insensitive to the part temperature variations.
