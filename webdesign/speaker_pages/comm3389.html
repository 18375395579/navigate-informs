Key findings are: 1) Logistics efficiency is critically dependent on both intra-firm asset specificity and inter-firm environment heterogeneity with port as transaction facility. 2) There is a logistics transaction cost economics that an adaptive advantage can be gained through port-centric industrialization of supply chains, which leads to geographically concentrated horizontal specialization and differentiation.
