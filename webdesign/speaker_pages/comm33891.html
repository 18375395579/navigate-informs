Title: Tractable Asset-Liability Management<br>Author: Dessislava Pachamanova, Associate Professor, Babson College, Babson Park, MA, United States of America, dpachamanova@babson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nalan Gulpinar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present models for asset liability management that are applicable to the management of pension funds and to the pricing of some kinds of structured financial products. The emphasis of the proposed approaches is on computational tractability and practical appeal. Numerical studies with real market data indicate that the proposed strategies have better worst-case performance than traditional stochastic approaches, as well as other desirable characteristics.
