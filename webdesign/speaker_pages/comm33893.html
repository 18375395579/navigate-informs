Title: Representing the Allocation of Forces, Fires, and Effects Using Genetic Algorithms<br>Author: Katherine Comanor, Associate Operations Researcher, RAND, 1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, CA, 90407, United States, comanor@rand.org<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Pernin, Lance Menthe, Louis Moore<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This presentation describes a combat planning tool that demonstrates the value of intelligence and its impact on route selection on a battlefield.  We use a genetic algorithm to search the vast space of potential maneuver schemes, and we parameterize our results based on intelligence of enemy intent, activity, capability, and location.  Additionally, our representation considers perceptions of an enemy’s ability to adapt and collect intelligence.
