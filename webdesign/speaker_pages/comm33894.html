<br>Title: Economic Impact Analysis of City Logistics Alternatives Using the Southern California Planning Mode</br><br>Author: Qian An, PhD Candidate, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90007, United States of America, qan@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Moore, Maged Dessouky</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Two-level city logistics distribution system has the potential to reduce distribution cost, but the most importantly benefit is the improvement of traffic conditions and other aspects of urban life impacted by the indirect cost of vehicles, such as environmental quality and safety. We apply the Southern California Planning Model, which is a spatial input-output model of the urban economy, to measure regional economic impacts in, but not limited to, the five-county Los Angeles region.</br>
