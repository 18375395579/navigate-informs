Title: Modeling the Effects of Changes in New Source Review<br>Author: Benjamin Hobbs, The Johns Hopkins University, Dept. Geography & Env. Engineering, Baltimore, MD, United States, bhobbs@jhu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: USEPA recently proposed revisions to the Clean Air Act's New Source Review programs. We used the LP-based Integrated Planning Model to bound the possible effects upon the power industry.  We find that, given tighter emissions caps under CAIR, the changes would lead to no or limited increases in national emissions.
