Title: Vaccine Inventory Design for a Break out of Epidemic Disease<br>Author: Yifan Liu, George Mason University, 4400 University Dr., MS 4A6, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States, yliu9@gmu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We aim at deriving the necessary stockpile levels for vaccine, in order to meet the urgent need, due to a natural breakout of an epidemic disease, or due to a bio-terror attack. We produce the relation between the optimal inventory levels and the decisive properties of vaccine production and the infectious disease, including the usual production and shipment rate, and the population dynamics of the infectious disease in the potential regions of vaccine shortage, etc.
