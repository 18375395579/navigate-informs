We present this as an extension of the VRP, where healthcare workers have different skill levels and can only serve patients for whom they have an adequate care-taking ability.  Initial models and computational results are presented, along with directions for future research that draw from our observations with the Center for Innovation in Healthcare Logistics.</br>
