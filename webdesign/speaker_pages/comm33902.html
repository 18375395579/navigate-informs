Title: Development and Field-testing of a Forest Fire Detection Decision Support System<br>Author: David Martell, University of Toronto, 33 Willcocks Street, Faculty of Forestry, Toronto, ON, M5S 1A1, Canada, david.martell@utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Colin McFayden, Douglas Woolford<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Forest fire managers seek to find fires while they are small to increase the chance that they will be contained by the initial attack system while they remain small. We describe how subjective assessments of the probability of daily people and lightning-caused fire occurrence and statistical analyses of historical fire occurrence and weather data were combined to develop a fire detection DSS and report on the results of our 2012 field test of the system.
