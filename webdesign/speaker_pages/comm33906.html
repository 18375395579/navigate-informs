Using Swaziland as a pilot, the team quantified at-risk populations and times for malaria and intervention costs for spraying. They developed recommendations for number and placement of facilities with scheduled deployment for labor, chemicals, and trucks. The team designed an interface to test and visualize the benefits of adapting the methodologies throughout Africa.
