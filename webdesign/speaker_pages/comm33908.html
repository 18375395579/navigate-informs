Particularly, there is a user company and a service provider that does outsourcing work for the user company.  However, the service provider's cost structure is not perfectly observed by the user.  Our results suggest that outsourcing companies can use relatively simple and yet robust contracts to assure a high level of capacity and service quality even when they do not have perfect information of the service provider.</br>
