<br>Title: Harmonization and Aggregation of Energy Technology Elicitations</br><br>Author: Erin Baker, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, United States of America, edbaker@ecs.umass.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: There have been a number of expert elicitations performed on energy technologies recently, including 5 studies on solar and 7 on CCS. In this project we are attempting to harmonize and then aggregate the data from disparate studies. Harmonizing the data across the elicitations has a number of specific challenges, as surveys differ along several dimensions, including the metrics elicited, the timing, and the levels of R&D funding considered.</br>
