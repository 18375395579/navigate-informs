<br>Title: Integer Programs for Margining Option Portfolios by Option Spreads with More Than Four Legs</br><br>Author: Dmytro Matsypura, Lecturer, University of Sydney, Rm 478, Merewether Building, Sydney, Australia, dmytro.matsypura@sydney.edu.au</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Timkovsky</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Margining is a crucial brokerage operation. It is especially challenging for option portfolios because offsets with options require solving an intractable IP. These offsets are based on option spreads with up to 4 legs. Option spreads with more than 4 legs allow the brokers to substantially increase the accuracy of margin calculations for option portfolios. We develop a theoretical framework for option spreads with any number of legs, formulate alternative IPs, conduct numerical experiments.</br>
