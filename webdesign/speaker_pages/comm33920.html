Title: Myopia of Selection:  Does Organizational Adaptation Limit the Efficacy of  Population Selection?<br>Author: Hart Posen, Assistant Professor of Strategy, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, hposen@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Levinthal<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A central tenet of the evolutionary analogue in organization theory is that selection disproportionately removes less fit firms.  However, the analogue is imperfect because variation is not blind - firms engage in adaptive learning.  Is the efficacy of selection invariant to the nature of the adaptation process?  We find that learning intended to enhance the performance of individual firms may have the unintended consequence of reducing the efficacy of selection in identifying superior firms.
