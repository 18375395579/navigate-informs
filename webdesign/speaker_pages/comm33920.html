However, the analogue is imperfect because variation is not blind - firms engage in adaptive learning.  Is the efficacy of selection invariant to the nature of the adaptation process?  We find that learning intended to enhance the performance of individual firms may have the unintended consequence of reducing the efficacy of selection in identifying superior firms.</br>
