Title: The Impact of Peaking Electrical Generating Units in Northeast<br>Author: Alper Unal, MACTEC Inc., Trenton, NJ, United States, Alper.Unal@dep.state.nj.us<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Electric Generating Units are one of the highest contributors of air pollutants, especially for NOX and SO2. Under certain conditions their impact on air quality might be significant. In this study, our aim is to quantify uncertainty in EGU emissions. For this we have developed unit specific temporal profiles, using hourly data for Northeastern United States. This paper will present detailed analysis emission processing as well as its implications on air quality through CMAQ model.
