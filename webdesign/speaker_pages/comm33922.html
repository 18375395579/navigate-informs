Title: Cognitive Complexity and Consideration Sets<br>Author: Olivier Toubia, Columbia Business School, Uris 522, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, ot2107@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Theodoros Evgeniou, Rene Befurt, Daria Silinskaia, John Hauser<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop and test methods to identify cognitively-simple decision rules that explain which products consumers select for their consideration sets. Drawing on qualitative research we propose disjunctions-of-conjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize well-studied decision models such as disjunctive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. Drawing on behavioral insights about cognitive complexity, we illustrate how these insights can be implemented to estimate DOC models.
