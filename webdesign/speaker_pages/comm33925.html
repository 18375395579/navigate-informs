Title: Flexibility and Fragility in Supply Chain Network Design<br>Author: Michael Lim, Northwestern University, Department of IE/MS, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, m-lim2@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Daskin, Achal Bassamboo, Sunil Chopra<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine the impact of disruptions on alternative chained manufacturing/product configuration.  We introduce fragility to quantify the change in system performance resulting from a disruption.  Simulation insights for both node and link failures are discussed as is a decomposition scheme for systems with multiple disruptions.
