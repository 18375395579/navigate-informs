Title: Opportunities and Challenges for OR in the Next Five Years<br>Author: Karla Hoffman, Professor, George Mason University, Mail Stop 4A6, SEOR Department, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States, khoffman@gmu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Earlier, OR was hampered by computing costs, lack of data and the inability of our tools to provide timely answers. Now, we are inundated with data, computing is virtually free, our tools are capable of providing real-time solutions, and graphical interfaces make it easy to control the process and output the findings. Together, these developments point to many new opportunities for OR. This talk highlights some new directions and challenges for OR modelers and educators.
