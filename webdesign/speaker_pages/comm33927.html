Title: Taking Back Control of your Identity Certification: An Alternative to Traditional Credentials<br>Author: John H. Gerdes, Associate Professor, University of South Carolina, 1301 Gervais Street, Suite 1010, Columbia, SC, 29201, United States of America, JGERDES@sc.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Dossiers can be created by using personal identifiers to link records from independent information systems. We discuss a new class of digital certificate (veiled certificates) that prevent this linkage, yet uniquely identifies individual, satisfying reporting requirements. We illustrate how to incorporate biometrics to protect against user’s misuse of credentials, and still maintain credential’s desirable non-linkability property. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.
