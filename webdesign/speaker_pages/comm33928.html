<br>Title: A Model of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that Accounts for Forward Markets for Crude Oil</br><br>Author: Fernando Oliveira, DR, Warwick University, Warwick Business School, The University of Warwick, Coventry, na, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom, fernando.oliveira@wbs.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fred Murphy</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has not been used effectively to manage the effect of oil shocks on consuming nations. The main reason is that political aspects of drawdown decisions dominate over economic benefits. We develop an MPEC model of the build up and drawdown of the reserve to maximize consumer welfare subject to the no-arbitrage condition for private inventory holders. The model consists of the government as the leader in a Stackelberg game with private inventory holders as followers.</br>
