Title: Branch and Bound for Mixed Integer Second Order Cone Optimization: Impact of Disjunctive Conic Cuts<br>Author: Julio Cesar Goez, Ph.D. Candidate, Lehigh University, 18015, United States of America, jgoez1@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Pietro Belotti, Ted Ralphs, Tamás Terlaky, Imre Polik<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate the use of Disjunctive Conic Cuts (DCC) in a Branch and Cut framework when solving MISOCO problems. Various criteria are explored to select the disjunctions to build DCCs at different nodes of the tree. Additionally, we explore different criteria for node selection and branching rules. These experiments will help us to understand the impact that DCCs have in decreasing the size of the search tree and the solution time.
