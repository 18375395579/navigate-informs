<br>Title: Chinese Cultural Influences on Retail Channel Selection</br><br>Author: Clyde Warden, Professor, National Chung Hsing University, Department of Marketing, NCHU, 250 Kuo Kuang Road, Taichung, TW, 40227, Taiwan - ROC, cwarden@cwarden.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Judy Chen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This research examines the drivers behind consumer preferences for traditional wet markets and the role of local Chinese culture. In the case of poultry, a combination of ritual use, emphasis on freshness, and existing convenient retail channels encourages consumers to avoid hypermarkets. Using survey data in a Chinese cultural setting, we proposes a model of how local culture influences this choice. Western retailing formats may benefit firms little when consumers stress local needs.</br>
