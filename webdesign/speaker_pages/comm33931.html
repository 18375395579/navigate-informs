Title: Global Product Development Processes<br>Author: Steven Eppinger, Professor and Deputy Dean, MIT Sloan School of Management, 50 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States, eppinger@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anshuman Tripathy<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This research explores various modes of implementing global product development, including the outsourcing and offshoring of engineering services.  We have observed two distinct ways to distribute work: process decomposition and component decomposition.  Through several case studies, we have identified particular challenges for coordinating the product development process deriving from each type of work decomposition.
