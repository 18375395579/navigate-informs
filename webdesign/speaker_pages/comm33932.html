Title: Can You Beat the Market? Accuracy of Individual and Group Post-prediction Market Judgments<br>Author: Andreas Graefe, Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis, Research Center (Forschungszentrum) Karlsruhe, P.O. Box 3640, Karlsruhe, BW, 76021, Germany, graefe@itas.fzk.de<br>Coauthor(s): J. Scott Armstrong<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Research with prediction markets indicates that confidence in market results is low. If so, it should be easy to improve market forecasts by posterior adjustments. We conducted experiments to compare market accuracy with posterior individual and group estimates. We hypothesized that posteriors would improve market results. The results were contradictory with our hypotheses: Posteriors were less accurate than the market results. Individuals performed even worse than simple random guessing.
