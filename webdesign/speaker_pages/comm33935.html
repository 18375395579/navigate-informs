This research provides a framework for comparing different corporate structures using network theoretic characterizations. Some prevalent social networks are examined and compared to hierarchical structure both analytically and numerically. The result shows structures resembling social networks had more advantage in innovation. A general algorithm is provided to design desirable structures.</br>
