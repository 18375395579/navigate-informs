Title: A Multiple Perspectives Approach to Supplier Selection<br>Author: Sharon Ordoobadi, Associate professor, University of Massachusetts, 285 Old Westport Road, N. Dartmouth, MA, 02747, United States of America, sordoobadi@umassd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shouhong Wang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Using a single model for supplier selection could lead to a biased decision given the fact that any model has its limitations.  The qualities of the decision making process and the decision itself increase by applying a multiple perspectives approach. The multiple perspectives decision making allows collaboration and knowledge sharing among the participants which leads to a less biased decision. This study proposes a framework of multiple perspectives decision making.
