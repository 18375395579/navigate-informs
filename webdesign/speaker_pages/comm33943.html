Title: Trust-Or-Not: Exploring the Dark Side of Trust in Electronic Commerce<br>Author: Dezhi Yin, Doctoral Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree Street, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, Dezhi.Yin@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Han Zhang, Samuel Bond<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Building trust has become one of the most vital issues in e-commerce. Unfortunately, most prior papers focus on the trust-enhancing mechanisms, overlooking the trust-destroying ones. Based on prior literature, we define the distrust concept, argue for its separable role from trust, and build a framework to reveal their distinct fundamental structures. We point out the potential problems of conceptualizing/measuring trust previously, and provide a new exciting perspective for future research.
