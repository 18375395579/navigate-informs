<br>Title: Open Source Software: What We Know (and do not know) About Motives to Contribute</br><br>Author: Stefan Haefliger, Lecturer, ETH Zurich, Kreuzplatz 5, Zurich, ZH, 8032, Switzerland, shaefliger@ethz.ch</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sebastian Spaeth, Martin Wallin, Georg von Krogh</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A substantial amount of academic work has examined Open Source software developer motivations. We critically review this work and show that it can be divided into a Phase 1 in which scholars argued why developers contribute to open source software, and a Phase 2 that aimed at explaining the relationship between motivations and the institutional context. We argue for entering a third phase of research that considers the social practice of software development and the institutional context.</br>
