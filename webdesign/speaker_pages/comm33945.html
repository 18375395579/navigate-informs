We study its disbursement process through (i) an econometric analysis of disbursement and procurement data between 2003 and 2012; and (ii) a queueing model predicting national stock levels of medicines. This model quantifies the impact of the current process on central drug availability in 48 African countries and potential interventions that include bridge financing and an international buffer stock.</br>
