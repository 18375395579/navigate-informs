With the support of experienced academics, such as Bob Clemen, Ralph Keeney, Gregory Parnell, Larry Phillips and Detlof von Winterfeldt, the MARA group members trained 30 international participants from ten different countries to subsequently conduct decision analyses in five projects in Germany. In addition to the core idea of MARA, we introduce in this presentation, two MARA cases at the interface between decision analysis and HR strategy.</br>
