We use an archival data from the largest online and mobile ecommerce website in China and exploit a quasi-natural experiment. Results show that the introduction of the tablet enhances the overall growth of ecommerce markets with its annualized impact of US$4.88 billion. The tablet channel is a substitute for the existing PC channel and a complement for the smartphone channel.</br>
