<br>Title: Multi-Product Inventory Routing with a Heterogeneous Fleet of Vessels at Omya Hustadmarmor</br><br>Author: Nordli Atle, Associate Professor, Norwegian School of Management, Nydalsveien 37, 0484 Oslo, Oslo, Norway, atle.nordli@bi.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stephane Dauzere-Peres</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A DSS for maritime inventory routing has been developed and implemented. The system has increased both supply chain predictability and flexibility. Direct savings in production and transportation are estimated to 11 million dollars a year. Investments of 35 million dollars have been avoided due to increased capacity utilization, and oil consumption has been lowered by 12 percent as a result of the project.</br>
