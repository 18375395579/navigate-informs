<br>Title: Evolution of Product and Service Provider Networks: An Empirical Analysis and Visualization</br><br>Author: Hyunwoo Park, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Dr NW, Main Bldg Rm 128, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, hwpark@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rahul Basole</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We examine how the network structure among service providers, product manufacturers, and platform providers have shaped inter-firm coordination of nearly 1,500 smartphone launches in the mobile ecosystem between 2000-2012. Network analysis on a tripartite graph—consisting of product-service-platform triads—reveals dynamic patterns of strategic service alliance and switching between platforms. We complement our analysis with network visualizations and discuss service-level strategic implications.</br>
