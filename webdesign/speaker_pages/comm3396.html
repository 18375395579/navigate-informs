<br>Title: Call Center Outsourcing: Coordinating Staffing Levels and Service Quality</br><br>Author: Justin Ren, Assistant Professor, Boston University School of Management, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States, ren@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yong-Pin Zhou</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we study the contracting issues in an outsourcing supply chain consisting of a user company and a call center that does outsourcing work for the user company. We model the call center as a G/G/s queue with customer abandonment. Our results suggest that managers pay close attention to service quality and its contractibility in seeking call center outsourcing.</br>
