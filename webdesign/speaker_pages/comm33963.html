It took leadership, analysis, and technology to make it happen. We briefly review the history of containerization and note the role that OR/MS played in it. OR was essential in determining such factors as the size and speed of the ships, the size of the fleet, the dimensions of the containers, and the equipment used in terminals  and the method of operation of the container terminals. Progress in OR models and techniques has matched the growth of intermodal transportation.</br>
