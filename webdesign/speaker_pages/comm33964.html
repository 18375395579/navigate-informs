Title: The Role of Flexible Beds in Bed-block Management<br>Author: Soroush Saghafian, Arizona State University, 699 S. Mill Avenue, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, Soroush.Saghafian@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ohad Perry<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The bed-block phenomenon refers to situations in which Emergency Department (ED) patients who need to be hospitalized cannot be transferred to Inpatient Wards (IW) due to lack of available beds. In some instances, if patients block beds for a long time, they are transferred to so-called ``flexible beds,?i.e., beds that are not in their designated IW. We emphasize the role of flexible beds, and find effective patient transfer and discharge guidelines that can alleviate the bed-block.
