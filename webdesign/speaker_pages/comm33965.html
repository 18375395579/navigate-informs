Title: New MIP Node Selection Heuristics<br>Author: John Chinneck, Professor, Carleton University, Systems and Computer Engineering, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, ON, K1S 5B6, Canada, chinneck@sce.carleton.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Wojtaszek<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a number of new heuristics for node selection in MIP, including triggering node selection, selecting the next node, and defaulting to a simpler node selection strategy. A large empirical study shows significant improvement over the state of the art.
