Title: Critical Thinking for Complex Network Systems: Trends, Tools, and Techniques for the OR Analyst<br>Author: David Alderson, Assistant Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Department, 1411 Cunningham Rd, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, dlalders@nps.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Recent attention toward the large-scale structure of many important complex network systems has led to the proliferation of new theories that attempt to explain, predict, and control their ongoing development and behavior. This tutorial will present the origins, contributions, and trends in the emerging field of “network science.?It will contrast the predominant perspective in the existing network science literature with that of decision science and highlight opportunities for contribution.
