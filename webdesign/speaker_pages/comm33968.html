Title: Effects of Air Pollutant Emissions Control on the Cost and Spatial Distribution of Biorefineries<br>Author: Colin Murphy, Graduate Student Researcher, University of California Davis, 2028 Academic Surge, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, cwmurphy@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nathan Parker<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: UC Davis has developed, a spatially explicit technoeconomic model of large-scale biofuel production in the U.S.Biofuel production may lead to significant air pollutant emissions from agricultural and biorefinery activity. Current research adds costs of additional air pollution control devices to biorefineries in PM and Ozone nonattainment areas, to determine whether the costs of compliance significantly alter the final fuel costs or spatial distribution of biorefineries.
