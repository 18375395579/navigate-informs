Title: Large-scale Modeling and Analysis for Contraflow and Phased Evacuation Operations in Central Texas<br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E. 2nd St., Tucson, AZ, United States, chiu@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hong Zheng, Russell Henk, Walter Peacock<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss the modeling process and results for planning for evacuating several millions of evacuees out of Galveston and Houston, Texas inland to other major Texas cities through the central Texas highway network. Model formulation and computational analysis are conducted for both contraflow and phased evacuation operational strategies. DYNASMART-P was modified enhanced as the computational platform for this research.
