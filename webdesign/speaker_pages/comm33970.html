Title: Frank Bass and Future Dissertation Topics<br>Author: Mark Parry, Professor, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 321 Bloch School, 5110 Cherry Street, Kansas City, MO, 64110, United States, parryma@umkc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Norton<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Frank Bass is well known for his work in diffusion modeling, stochastic processes, and applications of the scientific method to business data, with an emphasis on econometric testing and modeling.  However, one can make a strong case that his most singular pursuit was the development of doctoral students.  In this session we discuss possible extensions of his research that might serve as disseration topics for future doctoral students.
