Our objective is to study how efficiency in implementing the obesity interventions, affects resources required, intervention capabilities, and obesity mitigation. We adopt a DEA approach to find appropriate model specifications, define the inputs, outputs and outcomes for the transformation process and present insights in evaluating obesity policies.
