<br>Title: The Incorporation of Activity Failures in Project Planning: A Formalization and Some Preliminary Results</br><br>Author: Roel Leus, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, FETEW, KBI, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, 3000, Belgium, roel.leus@econ.kuleuven.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bert De Reyck, Yael Grushka-Cockayne</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The goal of this article is to survey the relevant literature on project scheduling with possible activity failures from a number of different disciplines, and to distill from these sources the formulation of a general optimization problem, the further study of which we  would like to foster among the scheduling community. The model has been formulated  with R&D projects in mind, but its study may be useful also for developing planning methods in other contexts. We discuss a number of different aspects of this task selection and scheduling model with task failures by means of a number of illustrative examples.</br>
