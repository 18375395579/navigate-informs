<br>Title: Process-Oriented Tolerancing for Multistation Assembly Systems</br><br>Author: Yu Ding, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, yuding@iemail.tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Darek Ceglarek, Judy Jin, Jianjun Shi</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In multi-station manufacturing systems, the quality of final products is significantly affected by both product design as well as process variables. Historically, however, tolerance research primarily focused on allocating tolerances based on product design characteristics of each component. The concept of process-oriented tolerancing expands the current tolerancing practices, which bound errors related to product variables, to explicitly include process variables.</br>
