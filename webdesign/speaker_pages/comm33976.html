<br>Title: Operational Investment and Capital Structure under Asset Based Lending</br><br>Author: Yasin Alan, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, Vanderbilt University, Owen School, 401 21st Ave. S., Nashville, TN, 37203, United States of America, Yasin.Alan@owen.vanderbilt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vishal Gaur</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the implications of asset based lending for operational investment, probability of bankruptcy, and capital structure for a newsvendor firm. Using a single-period game between a business owner and a bank, we show how asset based lending helps the bank mitigate adverse selection under information asymmetry. We also derive the collateral value of inventory, which contrasts with simple rules of thumb used by banks in practice.</br>
