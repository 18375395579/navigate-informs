Title: Eco-operational Benchmarking: The Case of Aircraft<br>Author: Nicole Adler, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, 91905, Israel, msnic@huji.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Gianmaria Martini, Nicola Volta<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A new, eco-operational DEA directional distance profit function analyses a data set consisting of current engine aircraft combinations from the perspective of airlines, government agencies and the environment. We explore the incentive schemes that may encourage airlines to choose a fleet that is both profitable and green. Furthermore, we identify the trade-off among pollutants and noise for the aircraft and engine manufacturers involved in research and development based on the DEA methodology.
