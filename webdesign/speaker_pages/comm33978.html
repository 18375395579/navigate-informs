<br>Title: Integrated Dispatch and Relocation Model to Minimize Emergency Vehicle Response</br><br>Author: Ibrahim Capar, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States of America, icapar@cba.ua.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Burcu Keskin, Sharif Melouk</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: To prepare for emergency events, EMS managers must address issues related to emergency vehicle dispatching and relocation. We use an MIP formulation to model emergency vehicle dispatching and relocation with the goal of minimizing incident response time while still maintaining adequate network coverage. We conduct extensive experimentation to examine model performance and glean managerial insights.</br>
