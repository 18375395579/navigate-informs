<br>Title: China's Evolving Talent Pool: A Strategic Perspective</br><br>Author: Cong Cao, Senior Research Associate, Levin Instittute, Cong.Cao@suny.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In 2005, China graduated over 800,000 engineers from its universities. Spending on science and technology is increasing at a faster rate than overall economic growth. Many of the world’s most innovative companies have established R&D centers to develop new products and services for global markets and the Chinese domestic market.  Once considered one of the more backward developing countries, today China stands at becoming one of the world’s major economic and technological forces.    Underlying these transitions is the emergence of a large, increasingly well educated talent pool.  Building upon significant investments to modernize and upgrade the country’s higher education system and R&D infrastructure, China hopes to harness its major resource ?people ?to close the technological gap between itself and the West. The launch of a new Medium-to-Long Term Plan for Science and Technology in 2006 further reflects this commitment to bring China into a leadership position in the 21st century.    At the heart of the debate about whether China’s potential can be realized, lie a number of issues related to the quantity/quality of China’s scientific and technical workforce.  Will China have sufficient talent to compete with the US and other leading technological nations?  How will demographic trends in China affect the supply of college age candidates for university enrollment?  What has been the impact of Chinese scientists and engineers who have been trained abroad and have returned to China? And, what factors in the changing complexion of the Chinese economy will affect the supply and demand for high-end talent?</br>
