Title: The Value of Sample Information for Discrete Uncertain Variables<br>Author: Ahren Lacy, Stanford University, Huang Engineering Center, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA, 94305-4121, United States of America, ahrenlacy@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ross Shachter<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A decision maker has the opportunity to purchase multiple samples of discrete uncertain variables prior to an upcoming decision. We derive an approximate analytical expression for the value of the sample information as a function of the number of samples of each variable and their costs. We maintain the structure of a general decision problem with finite alternatives. Our work extends the classic results of Raiffa and Schlaifer (1961) using a Gaussian approximation to the sample information.
