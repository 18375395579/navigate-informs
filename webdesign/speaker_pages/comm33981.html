<br>Title: Information Exchange in Prediction Markets: How Social Networks Promote Forecast Efficiency</br><br>Author: Liangfei Qiu, University of Texas at Austin, 2225 Speedway, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, qiuliangfei@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Whinston, Huaxia Rui</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the effects of information exchange and social networks on the performance of prediction markets. We provide a game-theoretic framework to resolve the question: Can social networks and information exchange promote the forecast efficiency in prediction markets? Our study shows that social network is not a panacea in terms of improving forecast efficiency. The abuse of social networks could be detrimental to forecast performance.</br>
