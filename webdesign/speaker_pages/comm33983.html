Title: Configuration of Procurement Networks for Secondary Raw Materials<br>Author: Alexander Uffinger, University of Augsburg, Universitaetsstr. 16, Augsburg, BY, 86159, Germany, alexander.uffinger@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de<br>Coauthor(s): Axel Tuma<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The globalization not only causes a shortage situation for primary raw materials like steel or oils but also affect the markets for secondary raw materials like recycled paper. In this context, the structure of a paper's manufacture sourcing network needs to be (re)defined with care by paper manufacturers. After a presentation of the economics of paper manufacturers in Europe, we will present in the keynote a mathematical approach (MIP) developed together with a major European paper mill.
