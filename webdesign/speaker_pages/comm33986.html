Title: Fairness Ideals in Distribution Channels<br>Author: Paola Mallucci, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States of America, mallu004@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tony Haitao Cui<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We evaluate how firms make decisions in a two-stage dyadic channel. Using a Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) model, we show fairness significantly impacts channel pricing decisions. Additionally, we compare four principles of distributive fairness: strict egalitarian, liberal egalitarian, and libertarian, and a new principle- the sequence-aligned. The new ideal, according to which the sequence of moving determines the equitable payoff, significantly outperforms the other ideals.
