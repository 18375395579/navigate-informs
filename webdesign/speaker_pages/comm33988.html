Title: Off-line Adaptive Radiation Therapy<br>Author: Marina Epelman, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, mepelman@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Sir, Stephen Pollock<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Optimization-based planning of radiation treatments often produces sharp dose gradients between tumors and healthy tissue. Due to random shifts during treatment, significant differences between the “optimized?plan and the actual dose can occur. Radiation is delivered in small daily fractions, and we exploit the dynamic nature of treatment and information gathering by adapting the plan to fraction-to-fraction variations measured during a patient’s treatment course using Bayesian updating.
