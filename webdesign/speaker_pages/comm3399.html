The RT induction process involves the growth phase and the pruning phase. The pruning phase aims to generalize the RT that was generated in the growth phase.In this paper we present an integrated approach that also accomodates multiple relevant RT quality measures (e.g. accuracy, stability, simplicity).</br>
