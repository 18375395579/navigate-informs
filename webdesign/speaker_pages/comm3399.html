Title: Post-Pruning in Regression Tree Induction: An Integrated Approach<br>Author: Kweku-Muata Osei-Bryson, Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, 1015 Floyd Avenue, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States, kmuata@isy.vcu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A regression tree (RT) tree is a decision tree in which the target variable is continuous. The RT induction process involves the growth phase and the pruning phase. The pruning phase aims to generalize the RT that was generated in the growth phase.In this paper we present an integrated approach that also accomodates multiple relevant RT quality measures (e.g. accuracy, stability, simplicity).
