Iyer<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe a series of projects at the US Coast Guard (USCG) Aircraft Repair and Service Center (ARSC) that demonstrate the value of Operations Research methodologies for efficient Supply-Chain management. These projects provided critical decision support for planning various repair and maintenance activities at ARSC. ARSC has been transformed from a “data rich and knowledge poor?decision support culture to an “OR ingrained?decision making environment.
