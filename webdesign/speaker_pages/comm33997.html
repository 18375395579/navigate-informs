Title: Bringing Business Analytics to Your Desktop<br>Author: Kala Seal, Professor, Loyola Marymount University, One LMU Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90045, United States of America, Kala.Seal@lmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zbigniew Przasnyski<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a Business Analytics (BA) architecture that can be implemented on a desktop using free or readily available software.  We show how the architecture can allow users to develop understanding of data management issues, OLAP concepts, Data Mining and Visual Analytics without imposing a steep learning curve.  The architecture uses MySQL for the back end database, Excel, PowerPivot and MS-Access for data access and OLAP, and XLMiner and Tableau for data mining and visualization.
