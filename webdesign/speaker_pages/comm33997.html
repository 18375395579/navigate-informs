We show how the architecture can allow users to develop understanding of data management issues, OLAP concepts, Data Mining and Visual Analytics without imposing a steep learning curve.  The architecture uses MySQL for the back end database, Excel, PowerPivot and MS-Access for data access and OLAP, and XLMiner and Tableau for data mining and visualization.</br>
