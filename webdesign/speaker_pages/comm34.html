However, the benefits are dependent on how the co-generation is dispatched.  Economically optimal dispatch, in turn, will depend on both energy prices and tariff structure.  This research is a study of the effects of electricity tariff structure on the optimal dispatch of a cogeneration system at an industrial facility in Southern California.</br>
