Title: Distributed Generation Benefits Under Various Tariff Structures<br>Author: Ryan Firestone, Research Assistant, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, MS90R4000, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, rmfirestone@lbl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Chris Marnay<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The on-site cogeneration of electricity and heat can benefit individual adopters, utility electricity providers, and the greater customer base.  However, the benefits are dependent on how the co-generation is dispatched.  Economically optimal dispatch, in turn, will depend on both energy prices and tariff structure.  This research is a study of the effects of electricity tariff structure on the optimal dispatch of a cogeneration system at an industrial facility in Southern California.
