Title: Statistical Modeling of Marketing Contact Effects<br>Author: Dingxi Qiu, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Room C-217, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, d-qiu@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edward Malthouse, Ajit Tamhane<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This study attempts to quantify the effect of a marketing contact on the future customer purchase behavior. While the direct effect is usually easy to compute; the indirect effect is hard to model. We analyze the marginal effect of an additional marketing contact based on the contact and transaction history in the database so that the on-line advertisers can dynamically determine whether to serve an individual prospect the commercial or not.
