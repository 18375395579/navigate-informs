<br>Title: On the Robustness of Secrecy and Exposure of Defense System in Defender-attacker Games</br><br>Author: Mohammad Nikoofal, PhD Student, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Street West, Desautels Faculty of Management, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, mohammad.nikoofal@mail.mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhuang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: It is commonly accepted in literature that, when facing a strategic terrorist, the government can be better off by manipulating the terrorist's target selection through exposing her defense system. But, the impact of terrorist's private information may significantly affect the government's first-mover advantage. In this paper, we compare the robustness of the defense equilibrium against the uncertainty in terrorist's valuation of targets in a sequential game with that in a simultaneous game.</br>
