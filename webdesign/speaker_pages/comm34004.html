Title: Food, Energy, and Environment Trilemma: Sustainable Farmland Use and Biofuel Industry Development<br>Author: Xin Wang, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 111 E Healey St Apt 202, Champaign, 61820, United States of America, wangxin1@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Lim, Yanfeng Ouyang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: With limited farmland, stimulating the growth of the biofuel industry while protecting food security and preserving environmental sustainability is a difficult trilemma. We propose a continuous approximation based game-theoretic model to capture multiple stake-holders?behaviors (food, energy, and environment). We obtain insights on the impact of the emerging biofuel industry, and provide subsidy guidelines on how policy-makers should intervene to achieve socially favorable farmland use.
