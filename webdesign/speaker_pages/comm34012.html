Title: Development of a Feasibility Model for a High Speed Rail Line<br>Author: Reinaldo C. Garcia, Associate Professor, Universidade de Brasilia (UnB), Industrial Engineering Department, Faculty of Technology, Brasilia, DF, 70910-900, Brazil, rcgar@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Aline Goulart<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We have developed a model to determine the feasibility of a High-Speed Rail (HSR) line. Issues including the uncertainty of the demands and price elasticity are addressed, and the model is implemented for the HSR to be built in Brazil, connecting the cities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
