Title: Bond Portfolio Optimization for Impact of Credit Contagion<br>Author: Wendy Roth, Georgia State University, 1043 College of Business, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, wroth@gsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chanaka Edirisinghe, Aparna Gupta<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Portfolios are constructed to achieve maximum risk-adjusted returns.  An unanticipated event impacting securities issued by one firm can spread to other firms due to connections existing between firms, potentially resulting in a contagion effect. This can adversely affect the level of tail risk in a portfolio, especially when a number of connected firms are included in a portfolio.  An  optimization developed to evaluate contagion related risk in a portfolio of debt instruments is examined.
