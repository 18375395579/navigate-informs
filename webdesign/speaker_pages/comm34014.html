An unanticipated event impacting securities issued by one firm can spread to other firms due to connections existing between firms, potentially resulting in a contagion effect. This can adversely affect the level of tail risk in a portfolio, especially when a number of connected firms are included in a portfolio.  An  optimization developed to evaluate contagion related risk in a portfolio of debt instruments is examined.</br>
