We model the decisions of a regulator and multiple project managers (PMs) as a Stackelberg game. The regulator specifies pollution remediation requirements, and the PMs respond either by remediation or by investment in greener task design. Our results show that the decisions of the regulator and PMs are not initially coordinated. However, the regulator can coordinate them by providing a subsidy to the PMs.</br>
