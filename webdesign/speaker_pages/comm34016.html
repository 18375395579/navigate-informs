<br>Title: The Impact of Organizational Familiarity on Ambulance and A&E Department Performance</br><br>Author: Jonas Oddur Jonasson, PhD Student, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, United Kingdom, jonas.oddur.jonasson@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sarang Deo, Kamalini Ramdas, Zeynep Aksin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We explore how behavioural and operational factors, such as on-the-job learning, affect performance in ambulance systems. Hypotheses are tested on detailed data on the 2 million ambulance activations undertaken by London ambulances in 2011.  Results indicate that handover performance of an ambulance base and a hospital improves with their joint experience. However, at high levels of joint experience, performance may worsen. This may have implications for theoretical models of ambulance systems.</br>
