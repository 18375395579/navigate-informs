Simonoff, Rae Zimmerman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Spatial concentration of transportation facilities, capacity, usage and value are important indicators of transportation vulnerability to consequences of catastrophic events. Regional economic measurements and models to discern patterns in concentration are applied to U.S. air, sea, and land transport of people and goods, as well as the transport of energy products. Policy implications and transferability of decision tools are described.</br>
