<br>Title: Search for a Malevolent Needle in a Benign Haystack</br><br>Author: Donald P. Gaver, Operations Research Department, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, dgaver@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Patricia A. Jacobs, Moshe Kress</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Terrorist suicide attacks occur in small, crowded arenas, or in larger maritime domains. Suppose one such terrorist (Red) is present and moves randomly and clandestinely to avoid detection and locate vulnerable target groupings.  Blue searches for and detains suspicious elements. We model the probability that Blue neutralizes Red before detonation.</br>
