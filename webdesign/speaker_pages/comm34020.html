Title: Multi-objective Optimization of Sports League Alignments<br>Author: Stephen Hill, Assistant Professor, UNC Wilmington, 601 South College Rd, Wilmington, NC, 28403, United States of America, Hills@uncw.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Traditionally the development of sports league alignments has been driven by the placement of teams into divisions based on geographic proximity.  However, such an approach can lead to leagues with divisions that feature poor competitive balance.  In this work divisional competitive balance is incorporated into the optimal development of sports league alignments.  Results from the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League are presented and analyzed.
