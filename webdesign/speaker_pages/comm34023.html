Title: Network Analysis of Bibliographic Data from the Literature on Modularity<br>Author: Thomas Frandsen, Assistant Professor, Copenhagen Business School, Department of Operations Management, Solbjerg Plads 3, Frederiksberg, DK-2000, Denmark, tfr.om@cbs.dk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper applies network analytical techniques to citation data from the literature on modularity in the fields of management and engineering. This methodology for studying citation structure enables the identification of distinct areas of research on modularity as well as intellectual positions on which the literature is based. The analysis advances our understanding of the literature on modularity by systematically identifying its intellectual structure and evolution.
