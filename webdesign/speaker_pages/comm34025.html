Thus, service sector subsumes both the knowledge and entertainment industries (K&EI). Each K&EI firm is much more dependent on protection of its intellectual property (IP) rights than are companies or agencies in the other sectors. Because IP protection is an emerging domain, there is no general theory, model, or structure, for this field. Using a taxonomic approach this paper views the broad field of IP protection as a tapestry.</br>
