Title: Economic Evaluation of HIV Interventions: Expanded Screening versus Treatment<br>Author: Elisa Long, Assistant Professor, Yale University, 135 Prospect Street, PO Box 208200, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States of America, elisa.long@yale.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Margaret Brandeau, Douglas Owens<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In 2007, 2.5 million people worldwide became newly infected with HIV, more than four times the number who initiated treatment for HIV.  We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HIV intervention portfolios aimed at disease prevention, treatment, or a combination of both, using U.S. data.  We discuss how the cost-effectiveness of expanded screening and treatment depends on local epidemic characteristics, including HIV prevalence and the effectiveness of counseling at reducing risky sexual behavior.
