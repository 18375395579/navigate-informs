The goal of this field is to design policies and tactics that have the potential to improve individual life outcomes and neighborhood-level outcomes by addressing welfare, equity and administrative efficiency simultaneously. Community-based OR problems tend to be messy and dependent on political and social considerations. This tutorial defines community-based OR in the context of public-sector OR/MS, highlights current research in a variety of domains and identifies a number of new research opportunities. Two case studies in food security and affordable housing emphasize the commonality of problem attributes and the diversity of modeling and solution methods.
