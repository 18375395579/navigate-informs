Title: Teaching Integer Programming using an Academic Scheduling Project<br>Author: Dawn Strickland, Assistant Professor of Mathematics, Winthrop University, 156 Bancroft Hall, Rock Hill, SC, 29733, United States of America, stricklandd@winthrop.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ginny Batson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk we present two aspects of a course project in integer programming. First, a student discusses the motivation and formulation of a program that schedules classes based on instructors?time, day, and course preferences. Then, an instructor discusses methods and benefits of using this type of project to teach optimization techniques.
