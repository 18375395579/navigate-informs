The methodology  specifically applies to the development real-time trading tools, and its  repetitive design structure allowed a market making firm to quickly develop  optimization systems for trading complex products.  More generally, the  methodology illustrates how to take a mathematical algorithm from initial  concept, to working prototype in Excel, to working systems in a C++  client/server environment.  The rapid development techniques reviewed will  enable firms to quickly derive revenue by implementing new algorithms.</br>
