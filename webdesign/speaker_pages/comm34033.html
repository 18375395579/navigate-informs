Also we utilize low-fidelity data to reduce evaluation cost. These strategies mimic human actions in scientific discovery. Two methods are illustrated: Multiple Fidelity Sequential Kriging Optimization (MFSKO) and Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA). Application examples include radiation detector design and material discovery.</br>
