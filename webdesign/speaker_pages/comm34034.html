We propose to inject analytic rigor to the notion of value. We present six normative principles for determining the value of a service from the vantage points of the provider as well as the client. The principles are based on game theory, behavioral economics, financial accounting, and cognitive psychology. From these principles, we are able to derive the price of a service at which a Nash Equilibrium is established. We illustrate this with an example.</br>
