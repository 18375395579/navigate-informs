Title: Olympic Track and Field and Swimming: Politics and Drugs, Gender Differentials, Home Nation Advantage<br>Author: Raymond Stefani, Professor Emeritus, California State University, Lon Beach, 25032 Via Del Rio, Lake Forest, CA, 92630, United States of America, Raymond.Stefani@csulb.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Improvement trends for Olympic winning performances in track & field and swimming reveal the affect of world wars, the cold war, boycotts and the post-1988 crackdown on performance-enhancing drugs. The greatest technological efficiency improvements are discussed. Percent differences in female/male winning performances are shown to be explainable by physiological differences using physics and kinesiology. Home nation medal advantage is evaluated. A residual medal advantage remains after hosting.
