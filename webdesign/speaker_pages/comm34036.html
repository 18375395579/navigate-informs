<br>Title: Beyond the Revelation Principle: Manipulation-optimal Mechanisms</br><br>Author: Tuomas Sandholm, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Department, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, sandholm+@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abraham Othman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Conitzer and Sandholm (LOFT-04) constructed an example where a mechanism does better than the revelation principle would allow---if the agent behaves irrationally in any way.
