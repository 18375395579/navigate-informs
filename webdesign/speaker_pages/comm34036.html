Title: Beyond the Revelation Principle: Manipulation-optimal Mechanisms<br>Author: Tuomas Sandholm, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Department, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, sandholm+@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abraham Othman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Conitzer and Sandholm (LOFT-04) constructed an example where a mechanism does better than the revelation principle would allow---if the agent behaves irrationally in any way.  We study how generally this phenomenon can be capitalized on, by proving several possibility/impossibility results.  Finally, we show that Google’s keyword auction (GSP)---a mistake in the sense that it is not incentive compatible---is fortunate in that it has this property (under the usual natural strategy restrictions).
