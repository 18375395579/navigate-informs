There is no consensus among mathematicians, systems scientists, and political scientists studying the Electoral College on whether it can satisfactorily serve the U.S.  in the 21st century, especially after two close elections in 2000 and in 2004. Discussions of the Electoral College in the media are mostly those on opinions about this unique election mechanism and are not based either on its established quantitative features or on its true merits and obvious deficiencies, leaving them unknown or unclear to an overwhelming majority of the electorate. This session aims at demonstrating how OR can help the media communicate to the voters in a simple manner what is really known about key Electoral College quantitative features, as well as at spotlighting unsolved systems problems associated with analyzing this controversial election mechanism.</br>
