<br>Title: PhaseVis: Analyzing and Visualizing Disaster Tweet Messages</br><br>Author: Seungwon Yang, Virginia Tech, 1060 Red Leaf Ct., Christiansburg, VA, 24073, United States of America, seungwon@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sunshin Lee, Xiao Lin, Liangzhe Chen, Haeyong Chung, Andrew Wood</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: PhaseVis is a tool, which can visualize multiple aspects of disaster tweet datasets, namely the What, When, Where, and Who aspects.  Prior to visualization, tweets are classified using machine learning approach. Different categories might be used, for example, the four phases of emergency management (i.e., response, recovery, mitigation, and preparedness) or sentiments.  Our vision is to apply PhaseVis in different informatics domains such as health, business as well as disaster.</br>
