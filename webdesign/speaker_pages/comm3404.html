Title: Hedging under Convex Risk Measures<br>Author: Ronnie Sircar, Professor, Princeton University, Dept. of ORFE, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, sircar@princeton.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The study of convex measures of financial risk has a rich history in a short number of years. The axioms specify sensible properties that measures of risk should possess (and which the industry's favourite, VaR, does not). We discuss static-dynamic hedging of exotic options under convex risk measures, and specifically the existence and uniqueness of an optimal position. We illustrate the computational challenge when we move away from the risk measure associated with exponential utility.
