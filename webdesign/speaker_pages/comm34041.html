Title: Developing An Entire Public Health Campaign Modeling Suite<br>Author: James Burke, Systems Scientist, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S. Cass Ave, Building 900, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States of America, jay@anl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Charles Van Groningen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Public Health Preparedness Models rarely bring focus to an   entire Mass Prophylaxis Campaign.  Public Health needs models   to consider all of the supply,  behavioral and disease issues  across an entire jurisdiction for a total campaign closure analysis.  Our modeling method and Chicago test scenario will be presented.
