Title: Real Time Monitoring of Ultrasonic Cavitation in the Casting Process<br>Author: Jianguo Wu, University of Wisconsin, 1513 University Avenue, ME3255, ISyE, Madison, 53706, United States of America, wu45@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shiyu Zhou, Xiaochun Li<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In the research of Metal-Matrix-Nano-Composite (MMNC), ultrasonic cavitation is usually used to disperse the added particles, degas the molten metal and refine the grains in the casting process. The objective of this research is to develop a new method for real time monitoring of ultrasonic cavitation and dispersion status in the casting process. By studying the cavitation noise, a new method is proposed to choose the cavitation power and control the cavitation time.
