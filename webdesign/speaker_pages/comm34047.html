Title: Development of a Tool for Environmentally Sustainable Decision Making<br>Author: Ben Ewing, UMass Amherst, 15 Cedar St., Northampton, MA, United States of America, ben.r.ewing@gmail.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss the development of a decision tool for use in selecting green energy technologies in which to invest.  Our tool was developed specifically for the Hitchcock Center for the Environment (HC) in Amherst, MA.  Our Excel tool allows users to select various technologies (solar, daylighting, heating) and see the financial and environmental impacts of their choice.  We found that the optimal choice for the HC is to install a biomass heating system and avoid investment in other technologies.
