Title: New Drug Development in the Pharmaceutical Industry- A Teaching Game<br>Author: Shan Li, PhD Candidate, UC Berkeley, IEOR, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, lisapine@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Max Shen, Yao Ma<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We developed a game to help students understand the complexity involved in selecting which new drugs to develop and how to schedule the production of these drugs. The problem is further complicated with the presence of capacity constraints and the dependencies between drug candidates. The game is also capable of evaluating the performance of several practical decision rules.
