Title: Lower-bound Analyses of the Lift-and-Project Ranks of Graph-based Polytopes<br>Author: Yu Hin Au, PhD Candidate, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. W., Waterloo, ON, N2L3G1, Canada, yau@uwaterloo.ca<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We'll discuss some ongoing work on obtaining inapproximability results for Bienstock-Zuckerberg and Lasserre lift-and-project algorithms on graph-based optimization problems. This is joint work with Levent Tuncel.
