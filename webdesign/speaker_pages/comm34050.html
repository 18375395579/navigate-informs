We use instrumental variables based on intransitive triads to distill the effect of influence from that of unobserved user heterogeneity. Our preliminary results suggest that peer influence is a significant driver of both music discovery and subsequent listening behavior. Our analysis also sheds light on differences in the level of peer influence across music and user types, and the dynamics of network co-evolution.
