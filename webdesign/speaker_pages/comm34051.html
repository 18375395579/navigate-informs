We describe how we used a Plackett-Burman design to test 10 factors relating to advertising and promotion, and the location of the magazine in a store.  We discuss design issues such as number of stores needed and length of the test period. We compare our Plackett-Burman design to fractional factorial alternatives, and discuss our results.</br>
