<br>Title: Holistic Fleet Modernization: Integrating Vehicle and Portfolio Design Optimization</br><br>Author: Stephen Henry, Systems Analyst, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800-1188, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States of America, smhenry@sandia.gov</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Fleet portfolio management must consider complicated sets of tradeoffs, both in individual vehicle design and in the incorporation of vehicles into the fleet. Unfortunately, individual vehicles are currently developed without optimal fleet assimilation analysis. Similarly, fleet optimization currently does not methodically consider future vehicle configuration uncertainty. We will discuss a framework for unifying these decision processes and discuss the challenges and opportunities that arise.</br>
