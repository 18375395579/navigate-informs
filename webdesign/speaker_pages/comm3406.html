Title: Solving Nonconvex NLPs and MINLPs with BARON<br>Author: Nick Sahinidis, Swearingen Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Chemical Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, sahinidis@cmu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We report recent developments in the global optimization software BARON.  These include new simultaneous convexification techniques, a convexity detection facility, and new interfaces to a variety of modeling systems.  Extensive computational results will be presented.
