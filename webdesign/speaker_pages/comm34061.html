<br>Title: Strategic Procrastination to Exploit the Time-Quality Trade-off</br><br>Author: Sreekumar Bhaskaran, Southern Methodist University, Cox School of Business, PO Box 750333, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States of America, sbhaskar@mail.cox.smu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Obtaining higher quality requires greater effort and time. Hence, observing the completion time of a task allows a principal to rationally make inferences about the outcome quality. This brings up the interesting possibility that rational agents might exploit the principals rational inference by strategically delaying task completion to signal higher quality. We examine this effect through an experimental setup and explore its implications through an analytical model.</br>
