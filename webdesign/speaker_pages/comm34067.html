One great example is IBM that has long been more of a services company than a computer company. Services can be difficult to analyze and outputs may not be tangible products as units may not be easily converted to dollars. Universities are also considered a part of the service economy. They provide education as well as innovations resulting from research. This paper focuses on the service of transferring research results into the other sectors.
