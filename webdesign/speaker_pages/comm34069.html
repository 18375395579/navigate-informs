Title: The Analogues and Changepoint Methods for Poisson Data<br>Author: Wenny Chandra, Pennsylvania State University, 310 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, wenny@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elisabeta Vergu, Harriet Nembhard<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider Poisson-distributed Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI) data at national and regional levels, that have an unknown baseline, exhibit non-stationarity and high correlation. The (nonparametric) analogues and (parametric) changepoint methods are applied to this data and compared based on sensitivity and specificity. Implications on monitoring and decision-making in public health are discussed.    Keywords: analogues, changepoint, influenza-like-illness
