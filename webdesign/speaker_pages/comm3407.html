<br>Title: External Venturing for Strategic Renewal: Towards Understanding Who Makes Corporate Venture Capital Investments and Why</br><br>Author: Sandip Basu, University of Washington, sb4@u.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Corey Phelps, Suresh Kotha</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study examines the conditions under which firms participate in corporate venture capital (CVC), an important mode of exploration and strategic renewal. Based on extant literature and our field research, we conceptualize CVC investments as growth options. We integrate insights from real options research with an inducements and opportunities perspective of interfirm relationship formation to explain CVC participation. We use longitudinal data on 477 firms from the 1990 Fortune 500 list for the period 1990-2000 to investigate this question. We find that firms in industries with rapid technological change, high competitive intensity and weak appropriability engage in greater CVC activity. We also find that weak appropriability has a more pronounced effect on CVC activity when competitive intensity is high. Regarding firm characteristics, we show that firms that possess strong technological and marketing capabilities and resources developed from prior venturing experience engage in greater CVC activity. Finally, we find the combination of both strong technological and marketing capabilities reduces subsequent CVC activity. Our findings suggest that the exploration of new competences involves the exploitation of established resources and capabilities. We discuss the implications of these results for research into corporate entrepreneurship, VC syndication networks and real options.</br>
