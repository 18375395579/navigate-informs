Title: Risk, Process Maturity, and Project Performance: An Empirical Analysis of Federal IT Projects<br>Author: Anant Mishra, Professor, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, United States of America, amishra6@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Murray, Sidhartha Das<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Federal IT initiatives are organized in the form of large IT projects that require the coordinated execution of multiple, interdependent tasks, each of which may span diverse knowledge bases. Managing risks in such projects is a matter of serious concern for the government. Using longitudinal data collected from federal IT projects within a global high technology firm, this study identifies project risks and examines the role of process maturity (CMMI) in managing their performance impact.
