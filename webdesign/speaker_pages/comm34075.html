Title: Financial Control Systems and Gains From SOX Remediation<br>Author: Bruce Weber, Professor of Information Management, London Business School, Regents Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, bweber@london.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Of 400 companies reporting ineffective control over financial reporting in their 2005 10Ks, 52 identify inadequate computer systems as the source of the deficiencies.  About half of these companies address the IS problems and remediate their control problems by their 2006 10K filing date.  Remediating firms show 2006 shareholder returns 23% greater than firms whose 2006 10Ks identify continuing material weaknesses in control over financial reporting, and 4% greater than the CRSP EW index.
