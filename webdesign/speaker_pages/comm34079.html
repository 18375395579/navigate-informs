<br>Title: Nursing Home Care Quality: A Bayesian Network Approach</br><br>Author: Justin Goodson, Graduate Teaching Assistant, Department of Management Sciences, University of Iowa, S210 John Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, justin-goodson@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wooseung Jang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This study employs Bayesian networks to examine the multidimensional aspects of the quality of care in nursing homes. The findings indicate that nursing home quality is most accurately represented through a mix of structural, process, and outcome measures of quality. Furthermore, significant quality factors and their probabilistic relationships are identified.</br>
