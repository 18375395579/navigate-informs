Following detailed workflow observations using a standardized instrument, registration/intake process's and information flow were redesigned.      With no additional expenditures, efficiency (ratio of patient-provider time to all other time in the clinic) improved more then 25%, patient and staff satisfaction by more then 30% and clinical outcomes more then 10%.
