Title: Systematic Optimistic Biases in Energy Market Equilibria<br>Author: Ming-Che Hu, PhD Student, Johns Hopkins University, 313 Ames Hall, 3400 N. Charles Street, Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States, mchu@jhu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Hobbs<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The well-known Winner's Curse in auctions and the less familiar Optimizer's Curse in mathematical programming are closely related phenomena that arise from errors in objective function coefficients and lead to systematic optimistic biases. They are important because they lead people to be overoptimistic about the actual performance of solutions. This paper will extend these ideas to consider optimistic biases in competitive and oligopolistic Cournot market equilibria.
