Title: Replacement Strategies for Potentially Hazardous Substances<br>Author: Feryal Erhun, Stanford University, Department of MS&E, Stanford, CA, United States of America, ferhun@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Kraft, Robert Carlson, Dariush Rafinejad<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In 2007 the EU established strict chemical regulations to better protect human health and the environment. The US does not have such laws in place; hence there is often a gap between discovery of potentially hazardous substances and regulation. As a result, firm's replacement decisions are made without clear insight into risks and future regulations. We model a replacement decision, including public relations and competition risk. We then derive insights into how this reshapes a firm's strategy.
