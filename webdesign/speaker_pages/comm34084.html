The US does not have such laws in place; hence there is often a gap between discovery of potentially hazardous substances and regulation. As a result, firm's replacement decisions are made without clear insight into risks and future regulations. We model a replacement decision, including public relations and competition risk. We then derive insights into how this reshapes a firm's strategy.</br>
