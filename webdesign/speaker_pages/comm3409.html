Title: Creating a Testbed of Industry Problems for OR Model and Algorithm Development<br>Author: Ben Lowe, Bell Labs Ireland, Alcatel-Lucent, Blanchardstown Industrial Park, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, Ireland, blowe@alcatel-lucent.com<br>Coauthor(s): Robin Lougee-Heimer<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many researchers are challenged with developing algorithms and models for industrial problems -- without representative data and information related to the market characteristics that make the problem real.  ( Data access can influence the applicability and impact of research. )  We propose an approach to exchanging “real?problems and data between solution seekers & solution providers using an open-source philosophy.
