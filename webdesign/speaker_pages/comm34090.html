Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, jriosal@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): David Rios Insua, Cesar Gil<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We explore how Adversarial Risk Analysis (ARA) may be used to allocate security resources to protect urban spaces. We take into account the spacial structure and consider both proactive and reactive measures in that we aim at both trying to reduce criminality and recover as best as possible from it, when it happens. The proposed model is illustrated with a simple example.
