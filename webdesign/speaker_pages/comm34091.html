Title: Evaluation of Immobilization Alternatives for Eurex Process Waste Stored in Saluggia, Italy<br>Author: Alan Brothers, Senior Research Scientist, Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, 902 Battelle Boulevard, P.O. Box 999 MSIN: K6-08, Richland, WA, 99352, United States, alan.brothers@pnl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Shas Mattigod, Denis Strachan, Gordon Beeman<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Using technical descriptions of alternative performance, Sicieta Gestione Impianti Nucleari (Sogin) staff evaluated three alternatives to treat and immobilize radioactive Saluggia nuclear waste.  Battelle staff mapped technical performance to a broader set of decision objectives and used a modified SMART decision process without explicitly defining measurement scales and value functions.  Through this process, the Battelle staff verified the selection made by the Sogin staff.
