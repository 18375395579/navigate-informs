We collect data on 964 publicly traded firms in 23 industries from the years 1998 to 2007 (representing 8,473 firm year observations). Using panel data analysis, we find that operational flexibility is beneficial in highly unpredictable markets, whereas operational slack is beneficial in highly unstable markets.
