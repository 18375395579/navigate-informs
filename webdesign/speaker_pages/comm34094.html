<br>Title: The Architecture of Multi-partner Alliances in R&D Projects: Scale, Ambidexterity and Integration</br><br>Author: Anant Mishra, Assistant Professor, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA, United States of America, amishra6@gmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan MacCormack, Aravind Chandrasekaran</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Why are some partnering alliances more successful than others? And how should firms structure their partnering alliances, particularly when such alliances involve multiple partners? Using primary data on multi-partner alliances across 147 R&D projects in six different industries, we develop and test hypotheses that examines the interrelationship between the different elements of partnering architecture and quality performance in an R&D project.</br>
