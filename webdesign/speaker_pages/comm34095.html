Walton College of Business, Fayetteville, AR, United States of America, THavakhor@walton.uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mohammad Rahman, Pankaj Setia<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Choice of IT governance mode–centralized or decentralized–is an important decision facing firms. We argue that a firm’s choice is dependent on the technology clusters across different organizational sites. We empirically assess how similarities in software and hardware assets across sites lead to centralization of IT governance. In addition, we show how relative size of the site with the respect to its organizational headquarters moderates the effects of technology clustering on IT governance.
