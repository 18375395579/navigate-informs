Within 18 months, nearly every other major carrier followed suit. Here, we examine whether the fees are socially efficient. We find that the fees are in fact Pareto improving. While customers may dislike the fees, they are a means to alter customer behavior and thus reduce the airline's costs. Customers are compensated by lower base fares.</br>
