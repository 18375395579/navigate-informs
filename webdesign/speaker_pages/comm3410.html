Title: Modularity and the Geography of Innovation<br>Author: John Paul MacDuffie, Wharton School, U. Pennsylvania, 3105 Steinberg-Dietrich Hall, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, macduffie@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Some posit inexorable movement of industries from high levels of vertical integration and integral product architectures towards modular architectures and a horizontal structure.  I consider this hypothesis using a framework with three dimensions of architecture: product, value chain, and organization.  I apply this framework at industry, firm, and jurisdictional (nations/regions) levels to examine consequences of alignment and misalignment among these dimensions for the geography of innovation.
