Kannan, Brian Ratchford</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Marketing of information media in digital form or bundled with the conventional form has become increasingly common in product categories such as books, newspapers and music. As the content is common to both forms, the attractiveness to consumers of acquiring both is relatively low. However, the forms often have advantages over one another in specific usage situations. We find that emphasizing such usage situations increases the intent to purchase both forms as long as the second is discounted.</br>
