Title: A Peer-to-peer Network Security Pricing Model to Increase Networks?Resistance to Virus Propagation<br>Author: Daniel Rice, Loyola College in Maryland, 4501 N.

The P2P NSPM integrates findings from recent developments in complex network theory with an incentive-compatible pricing model. Prices are a function of the Pearson coefficient. Early results demonstrate that the P2P NSPM impacts the overall structure of the network, creating more secure P2P networks.
