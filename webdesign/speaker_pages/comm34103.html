<br>Title: Step-down Units vs. Intensive Care Units</br><br>Author: Carri Chan, Assistant Professor, Columbia Business School, New York, NY, United States of America, cwchan@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mor Armony, Bo Zhu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Step Down Units (SDUs) provide an intermediate level of care between the intensive care unit (ICU) and the general medical-surgical wards.  We consider how the relative sizes of these units impact patient flows and examine how to optimally allocate nursing staff across the units.  Our work provides guidance into the management of two hospital units reserved for the hospital's sickest patients and provides insight into the tradeoff between flexibility and increased resources which arises.</br>
