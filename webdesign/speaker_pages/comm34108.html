Title: Identification and Prediction of Economic Regimes to Guide Decision Making in Multiagent Marketplace<br>Author: Wolfgang Ketter, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands, WKetter@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Maria Gini, Paul Schrater, John Collins, Alok Gupta<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present an approach that enables software agents to make tactical decisions, such as product pricing, and strategic decisions, such as production planning.  Using a combination of machine learning and optimization techniques, agents characterize economic regimes, which are microeconomic conditions reflecting situations such as over-supply or scarcity.
