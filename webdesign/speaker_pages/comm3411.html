Peachtree NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, brian.jacobs@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vinod Singhal, Ravi Subramanian</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We categorize press announcements related to positive environmental performance into two major types -- awards & certifications, and initiatives.  We use event study methodology to estimate the average abnormal stock returns.  We find that although the stock market does not react to announcements in such broad categorizations, it does react to certain specific announcement types such as ISO14001 certification, voluntary emission reductions, and environmental philanthropy.</br>
