Title: On the Interaction Between Content Distribution and Traffic Engineering<br>Author: Ramesh Johari, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Center, Room 319, 380 Panama Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305-4026, United States of America, ramesh.johari@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dominic DiPalantino<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the modern Internet, users are often interested in downloading specific pieces of content, rather than in connecting to a specific host.  Since the same content is typically located at multiple places, the end system optimization over available content sources interacts directly with IP address-to-IP address flow optimization by traffic engineers.  We present several theoretical results on this interaction.
