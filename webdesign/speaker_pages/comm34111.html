<br>Title: Optimizing Age-specific Screening Strategy for Genital Chlamydia Infections in Women</br><br>Author: Nan Kong, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 206 S. Martin Jischke Drive, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, nkong@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Teng, Wanzhu Tu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Genital chlamydia infection is a common sexually transmitted disease. Since most infected individuals are asymptomatic and the incidence rate differs by age, we conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis on age-specific screening strategies. We present a discrete-time optimal control problem with cumulative care cost and terminal prevalence as the objectives. We solve the problem with respect to several age-specific screening strategies and address the computational efficiency issue.</br>
