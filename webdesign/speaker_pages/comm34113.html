<br>Title: Blind Portfolio Auctions</br><br>Author: Michael Padilla, Stanford University, Packard, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, mtp@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Van Roy</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Institutional investors sell a large volume of assets to brokers using blind portfolio auctions, typically first-price auctions where the investor engages a few potential buyers and provides limited information about the portfolio contents. Such trades can be inefficient for several reasons. We propose a mechanism that addresses these concerns via careful information management. This mechanism can be implemented through either a trusted mediator or an equivalent cryptographic protocol.</br>
