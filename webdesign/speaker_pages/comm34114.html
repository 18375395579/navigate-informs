Greenwood Ave., Tulsa, Ok, 74106, United States of America, dursun.delen@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Hess<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Due to high variability, cost of healthcare has become one of the largest risk factors for today’s businesses. Establishment of a practical healthcare commodity index provides the pathway to transparency, which allows businesses to trade healthcare cost futures, and ultimately creates the open market environment necessary to encourage and support competitive pricing. This presentation focuses on the overall process of developing (based on data and analytics) such a healthcare cost index.
