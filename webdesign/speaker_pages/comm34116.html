Title: An Integrated Response and Recovery Model for Disaster Relief Operations Support<br>Author: Kasin Ransikarbum, Department of Industrial Engineering, Clemson University, 110 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29630, United States of America, Kransik@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Scott Mason<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: While logistics research recently has placed increased focus on disaster relief operations, few studies have examined the response and recovery phases in post disaster operations. We present an integrated network optimization model for making strategic decisions in both the supply distribution and network restoration domains. We discuss equity-based solutions for constrained budget problems to provide decision makers with candidate restoration and distribution plans.
