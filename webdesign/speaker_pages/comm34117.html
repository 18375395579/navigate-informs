<br>Title: Targeted Information Release in Social Networks</br><br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, University of California-Berkeley, Department of Industrial Engineering, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, chen@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Junjie Zhou</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Various firms initially make information and access to their products/services scarce within a social network; thus, identifying influential players that facilitate information dissemination emerges as a pivotal step for their success.
