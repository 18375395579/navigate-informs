Title: Targeted Information Release in Social Networks<br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, University of California-Berkeley, Department of Industrial Engineering, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, chen@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Junjie Zhou<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Various firms initially make information and access to their products/services scarce within a social network; thus, identifying influential players that facilitate information dissemination emerges as a pivotal step for their success. Using a stylized model that features payoff externalities and local network effects, we show that the signaling incentive drives the optimal selection of leaders and can lead to a first-order materialistic effect on the equilibrium outcomes.
