Title: The Mathematics of Decision Making<br>Author: George Hazelrigg, NSF, ghazelri@nsf.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Decision making has 3 components, determination of alternatives from which a decision maker may choose,prediction of outcomes for each alternative,and expression of preferences against which the most preferred alternative may be determined. To get the mathematics of decision making correct,we must apply decision theory only to decisions, formulate predictions that are consistent with our beliefs and data,accept that predictive models cannot be validated,and construct a valid preference function.
