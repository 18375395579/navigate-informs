Title: Integrated Design of Order Picking and Sortation Systems<br>Author: Fahrettin Eldemir, Assistant Professor, Yildiz Technical University, Industrial Engineering Dept, Yildiz, Besiktas, Istanbul, Turkey, feldemir@fatih.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Recep Kizilaslan, Elif Karakaya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Order picking and order sorting are the two main operations that are mostly encountered within a warehouse. The research in the literature generally addresses the operational issues considering the both system as independent systems. In this study a performance evaluation model is suggested for the integration of the Order Picking Systems and Order Sortation Systems. Detailed aspects of design and operational parameters are addressed.
