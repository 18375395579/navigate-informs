Title: Learning from Customers: Individual and Organizational Effects<br>Author: Bradley Staats, Assistant Professor, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, McColl Building, CB 3490, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, Bradley_Staats@kenan-flagler.unc.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We explore the customer dimension of volume-based learning in a radiological setting, where individual doctors at an outsourcing firm complete radiological reads for hospital customers.  We examine more than 2.7 million cases for 1,431 customers read by 97 radiologists and find evidence supporting the benefit of accumulating customer-specific experience. We discuss the implications of our results for the study of learning as well as for the providers and consumers of outsourced services.
