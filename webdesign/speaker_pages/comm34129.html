Tran, T. K. Feng, J. Christopher Beck<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The Operations Research Challenge (TORCH) is an annual one-day University of Toronto contest whose main goal is to interest high-school students in OR. Teams of 3 or 4 students solve a variety of  OR questions, ranging from fun ones such as finding the best strategy in the game of Starcraft to serious ones, such as devising a treatment plan for lung cancer. This talk will describe the setup of the contest, its growth since 2011, example problems, and student feedback.
