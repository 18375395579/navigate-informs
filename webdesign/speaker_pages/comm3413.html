Title: Individual Decision-Making Competence (IDMC) of Young Adults: A Psychometric Test<br>Author: Nadine Oeser, PhD Candidate, London School of Economics and Political Science, Rheinstrasse 63, Berlin, 12159, Germany, N.Oeser@lse.ac.uk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Most advanced research defines IDMC mainly in terms of an individual’s ability to resist decision biases, a concept that is derived from behavioural decision theory. This approach does not cover decision analytical components such as the ability to envision one’s objectives. To provide a broader understanding of IDMC from a DA perspective, this research aims to develop a psychometric test that allows one to measure decision-making performance on various decision analytic components.
