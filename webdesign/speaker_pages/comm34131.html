<br>Title: Growth of New Business Ventures through Innovation Replicability</br><br>Author: Juliana Hsuan, Professor, Copenhagen Business School, Dept. of Operations Management, Solbjerg Plads 3, Frederiksberg, DK-2000, Denmark, jh.om@cbs.dk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Moren Lévesque</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a formal model of firm growth through replication that considers the extent of the investment to adapt routines as replication unfolds and the portion of this investment that goes toward innovation in the routines. Two growth policies for new business ventures emerge: bull-imitation and bear-innovation.</br>
