<br>Title: Integrating Judgmental Forecasts: The Role of Functions, Incentives and Social Value Orientation</br><br>Author: Stefanie Protzner, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, Netherlands, sprotzner@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Clint Pennings, Laurens Rook, Jan van Dalen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Lack of integration of sales and operations is an important shortcoming of judgmental forecasts, potentially undermining their accuracy. We posit that differential roles, incentives and social value orientation impact demand forecasts, and examine an integrative mechanism to pool information under such circumstances. Results confirmed that judgmental forecasts can indeed become more accurate once we account for forecasters?social value orientation and changes in role and incentive structure.</br>
