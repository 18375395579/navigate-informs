<br>Title: Scheduling in Wireless Networks in the Presence of State-feedback Delay</br><br>Author: Sanjay Shakkottai, Associate Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, ECE Dept, ENS 437, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, shakkott@ece.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lei Ying</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present recent results on scheduling and routing over wireless networks with time-varying channels in the scenario where only delayed channel and queue state is available. Specifically, we develop distributed algorithms that are throughput-optimal.</br>
