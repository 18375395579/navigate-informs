Title: Scheduling in Wireless Networks in the Presence of State-feedback Delay<br>Author: Sanjay Shakkottai, Associate Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, ECE Dept, ENS 437, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, shakkott@ece.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lei Ying<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present recent results on scheduling and routing over wireless networks with time-varying channels in the scenario where only delayed channel and queue state is available. Specifically, we develop distributed algorithms that are throughput-optimal.
