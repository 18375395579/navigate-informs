Title: An Uncertain Future: Offshore Outsourcing from the Manager's Perspective<br>Author: Christopher Clott, Associate Professor, Graham School of Management, Saint Xavier University, 3700 W. 103rd Street, Chicago, IL, United States, clott@sxu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine through interviews of project managers of firms in the U.S. the degree of environmental scanning of offshore outsourcing and its effects upon the internal workings of the firm. It is suggested that project managers entrusted with implementing offshoring arrangements to achieve short term cost reduction goals are unaware that it will involve potential far reaching long term effects including changing attitudes and behaviors in a disaggregated workplace.
