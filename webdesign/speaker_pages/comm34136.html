Title: Dynamic Pricing of Fashion Goods under Strategic Consumer Behavior<br>Author: Mike Wei, Washington University in St. Louis, 1 Brookings Dr., Campus Box 1133, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States of America, weim@wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yossi Aviv, Fuqiang Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study pricing models of fashion goods under strategic consumer behavior. Using a rigorously developed game theoretical framework, we demonstrate that acquiring the ability to resolve demand uncertainty via early sales observations may potentially be detrimental to revenue performance. We discuss the underlying reasons behind this phenomenon, the conditions under which it prevails, and its practical ramifications. We also discuss the efficacy of a “reward program?as a segmentation mechanism.
