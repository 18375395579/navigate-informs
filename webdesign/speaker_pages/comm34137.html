Professor, College of William and Mary, Mason School of Business, Williamsburg, va, 23185, United States of America, ram.ganeshan@mason.wm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tonya Boone, Robert L. Hicks</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This talk focuses on the dynamics of learning in professional services. Using learning curve theory, and supported by project-level data from an architecture-engineering firm, we report on how professional firms learn; how different units within the firm transfer and leverage knowledge for project effectiveness; and if and how it leverages knowledge from sub-contracted projects.</br>
