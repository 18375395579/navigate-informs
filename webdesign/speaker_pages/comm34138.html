<br>Title: Paradigm-changing vs. Paradigm-deepening Innovation: Firm Scope and Technological Response to Shocks</br><br>Author: Vivek Tandon, Assistant Professor, National University of Singapore, 15 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore, Singapore, vtandon@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gautam Ahuja, Curba Lampert</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We examine firms?technological response to supply shocks (sharp increase in a key input’s price). Firms can respond by investing in paradigm-changing technologies that use substitute inputs or in paradigm-deepening ones that improves the efficient use of existing inputs. Our framework relates this choice with the degree of relatedness across a firm’s businesses. We test our hypotheses examining the responses of large manufacturing firms in the United States to the oil shock of the early 1980s.</br>
