<br>Title: Using Science Fiction to Teach Leadership and Communication in an Undergraduate Information Systems Course</br><br>Author: Brian Butler, Associate Professor of Business Administration, Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, 226 Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States, bbutler@katz.pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michelle M. Butler</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Undergraduates often have difficulty understanding the complexity involved with implementing information systems in organizations.  Even when they comprehend the technical issues, they often miss the human and organizational issues, and as a result find it difficult to understand the importance of communication and leadership skills in the success of these efforts.  Well written science fiction can make the human and social challenges associated with technology more concrete, providing both context and grounding for efforts to incorporate communication and leadership into traditional information systems courses.  We will report on experience from a joint Science Fiction/Information Systems course.  Consideration will be given to ways in which the readings, discussions, and assignments worked together to increase student understanding of language, audience, and imagination and their role in effective organizational communication and leadership.  Particular emphasis will be placed on ways the techniques and materials could be used to supplement more traditionally organized courses in information systems and engineering management.</br>
