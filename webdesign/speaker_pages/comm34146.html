Title: Call Center Performance Models and Indicators<br>Author: Oualid Jouini, Assistant Professor, Ecole Centrale Paris, Laboratoire Genie Industriel, Grande Voie des Vignes, Chatenay-Malabry, 92290, France, walid.jouini@ecp.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Ger Koole<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a single-skill call center including abandonments. We focus on different service level definitions related to queueing delays. We show how these performance definitions, that are used in practice, can be modeled and calculated. We also gain additional insights from simulations.
