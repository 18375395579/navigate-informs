To estimate the economic impacts of SOD, we link a spatially-explicit model of pathogen spread with spatially referenced estimates of economic value.  The invasion model integrates the influence of ecological heterogeneity with the spatial force of infection. Damages are the product of the number of economic units infected and the economic damage per unit.</br>
