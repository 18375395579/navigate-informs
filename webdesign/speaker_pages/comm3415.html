Title: Spatial Analysis of the Economic Impacts of Sudden Oak Death<br>Author: Thomas Holmes, USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, P.O. Box 12254, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27709, United States of America, tholmes@fs.fed.us<br>Coauthor(s): Ross Meentemeyer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Sudden oak death (SOD), caused by the pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, is having a dramatic impact on urban forests in California.  To estimate the economic impacts of SOD, we link a spatially-explicit model of pathogen spread with spatially referenced estimates of economic value.  The invasion model integrates the influence of ecological heterogeneity with the spatial force of infection. Damages are the product of the number of economic units infected and the economic damage per unit.
