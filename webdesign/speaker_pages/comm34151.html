<br>Title: It's All Markov's Fault: Secrets of Targeting</br><br>Author: Doug Samuelson, Principal Decision Scientist, Serco-NA, 8711 Chippendale Court, Annandale, VA, 22003, United States of America, samuelsondoug@yahoo.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Where to appear, what issues to emphasize, how and where to get out the vote, what kinds of ads to run, how to raise funds, and other key campaign decisions all depend on analyses of which voters and contributors are open to persuasion.
