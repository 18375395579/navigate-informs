Title: It's All Markov's Fault: Secrets of Targeting<br>Author: Doug Samuelson, Principal Decision Scientist, Serco-NA, 8711 Chippendale Court, Annandale, VA, 22003, United States of America, samuelsondoug@yahoo.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Where to appear, what issues to emphasize, how and where to get out the vote, what kinds of ads to run, how to raise funds, and other key campaign decisions all depend on analyses of which voters and contributors are open to persuasion.  Markov Chain based targeting, similar to marketing segmentation, is one of the most important and widely used methods to answer these questions.  The speaker, a former campaign professional, will discuss how campaigns do targeting and some of its implications.
