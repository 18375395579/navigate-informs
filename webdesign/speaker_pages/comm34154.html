<br>Title: Secure Collaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment (SCPFR)</br><br>Author: Vinayak Deshpande, Associate Professor, University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler School, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, Vinayak_Deshpande@kenan-flagler.unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mikhail Atallah, Marina Blanton, Keith Frikken, Leroy Schwarz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Although the benefits of information-sharing are well known, many companies are averse to sharing their proprietary information due to fear of adverse impact from information leakage. This paper uses techniques from Secure Multiparty Computation to develop secure protocols for the CPFR business process. The result is a process that permits supply-chain partners to capture the benefits of information-sharing, but without disclosing their private information to one another.</br>
