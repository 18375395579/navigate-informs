Eng., 403 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, defarias@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ming Zhao<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present new inequalities that define facets of the continuous separable piecewise linear polytope. We also present computational results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the inequalities.
