Jack Hu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Existing research on cyclic profile monitoring is limited to between-cycle detection made for each finished part based on its entire cycle of signals. In manufacturing processes with critical part quality and high cost, however, process changes require detection before the part is produced so that within-cycle adjustments can be triggered. This research develops a monitoring and diagnosis methodology that is capable of making within-cycle decisions and guiding real-time process adjustments.</br>
