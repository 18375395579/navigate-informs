Title: Cost-effective Detection and Eradication of Forest Pest Colonies<br>Author: Robert Haight, USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, 1992 Folwell Ave, St. Paul, MN, 55108, United States of America, rhaight@fs.fed.us<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Establishment and growth of invasive species are ongoing processes, and managers need cost-effective strategies to detect and eradicate colonies over time. We address this problem with an age-class model of colony establishment and growth and determine cost-minimizing search strategies where eradication cost depends on colony size at time of detection.  Results are presented for gypsy moth control in the western United States.
