<br>Title: Recent Developments in Valuation to Support Real Asset Decision-Making: A CO2 Storage Example</br><br>Author: David Laughton, Principal / Adjunct Professor, David Laughton Consulting Ltd. / University of Alberta School of Business, 11006-125 St., Edmonton, AB, T5M 0M1, Canada, laughton.david@davidlaughtonconsulting.ca</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Value is an important metric in many large public corporations shaping the process of designing and choosing real assets. Separating and adopting the two aspects of so-called “real options?valuation (derivative asset valuation and decision tree analysis) can produce a technically superior form of valuation that conforms with the organisational structures and work flows in these corporations.  This increases the net benefit of adopting the proposed changes and makes it less costly to do so.</br>
