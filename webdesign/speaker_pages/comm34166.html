Title: Modeling as a Means and Barrier to Decision-making<br>Author: Richard Hatchett, Associate Director for Radiation Countermeasures Research and Emergency Preparedness, NIH/NIAID, 6610 Rockledge Drive, Room 4057, Bethesda, MD, 20892, United States of America, hatchettr@niaid.nih.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Policy determinations are seldom if ever driven exclusively by science, much less by the outcomes of modeling exercises.  Policy making harmonizes claims and counterclaims, competing interests, political priorities, and science in a delicate balancing act.  The author describes how data derived from pandemic mitigation modeling, historical analysis, and studies of influenza epidemiology informed the development of national pandemic preparedness policy.
