<br>Title: Crowd-Squared: A New Method for Improving Predictions by Crowd-sourcing Google Trends Keyword Select</br><br>Author: Shachar Reichman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA, United States of America, shachar@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tomer Geva, Erik Brynjolfsson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Information from the “crowd? such as Google Trends, had been successfully used to accurately predict a wide variety of events. Nevertheless, a major challenge is the generation of an appropriate list of search terms that resemble the phenomena of interest.  We introduce Crowd-Squared, a new crowd-based method, for selecting relevant search terms. We show that this method is successful in various domains and that it performs as well or even outperforms selection methods used in previous studies.</br>
