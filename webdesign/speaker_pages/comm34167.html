Nevertheless, a major challenge is the generation of an appropriate list of search terms that resemble the phenomena of interest.  We introduce Crowd-Squared, a new crowd-based method, for selecting relevant search terms. We show that this method is successful in various domains and that it performs as well or even outperforms selection methods used in previous studies.
