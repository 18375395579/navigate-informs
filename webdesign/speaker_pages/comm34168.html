<br>Title: Balancing Games: A Comparative Study of Individual and Group Incentives for Grid-Balancing</br><br>Author: Ori Marom, RSM Erasmus University, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, 3062PA, Netherlands, omarom@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sudip Bhattacharjee, Xu Han, Wolf Ketter</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: One of the most significant challenges for the implementation of smart energy grid is real-time balancing. We conduct a behavioral experiment in which both individuals and groups are asked to incur some inconvenience in order to produce a balanced and coordinated set of actions over time.  We compare the performance of individual players and groups of players in two scenarios: (i) when competitor’s actions and performance are observed;  (ii) when such information is not available.</br>
