Title: Quantifying Variability and Uncertainty Metrics for Wind and Solar Power<br>Author: Patrick Sullivan, National renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, Patrick.Sullivan@nrel.gov<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Using the ReEDS capacity-expansion model as a backdrop, we present statistical methods for quantifying variability and uncertainty of wind and solar power across an interconnected grid. Algorithms that estimate capacity value, operating reserve requirements, and curtailment levels describe the impact of resource variability on the electric sector and inform model investment decisions.
