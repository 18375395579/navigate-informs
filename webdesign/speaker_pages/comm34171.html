Title: Scheduling More Crash Tests on Fewer Vehicles<br>Author: Yuhui Shi, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Road, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, yuhuishi@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marina Epelman, Amy Cohn, Daniel Reich, Erica Klampfl<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Ford’s Safety organization performs crash tests on prototype vehicles at multiple planning phases of each new vehicle program. Improvements in scheduling can reduce the number of vehicles crashed, resulting in major savings. Manual planning each crash schedule and coordinating with all the other prototype vehicle users is extremely time intensive. We are developing an automated system that both minimizes the resources needed and significantly reduces the time engineers spend planning.
