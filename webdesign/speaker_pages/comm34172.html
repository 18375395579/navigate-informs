<br>Title: The Influence of Social Networks on Prediction Market Behavior</br><br>Author: Thomas Gruca, Henry B. Tippie Research Professor of Marketing, University of Iowa, S356 Pappajohn Building, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242-1992, United States of America, thomas-gruca@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sheila Goins</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Prediction market participants are embedded in a network of social relations that may affect the information they bring to the market and trading behavior. Using data from the IEM movie market, we model the influence of social networks on the private information (e.g., set of comparable products and key attributes) traders used to determine the values of contracts in the market. We also model the influence of social networks on trading behavior as well as individual and market outcomes.</br>
