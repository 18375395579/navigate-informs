Title: Optimization to Fully Synchronized Manufacturing<br>Author: Peng Qu, Senior Industrial Engineer, AMD, 5204 E Ben White Boulevard, MS 563, Austin, TX, 78741, United States, peng.qu@amd.com<br>Coauthor(s): Shekar Krishnaswamy<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In full automated 300mm wafer fabs,scheduling system is incapable to be the only decision making point of material flow. It needs comprehend contradictive information from other manufacturing systems(e.g. AMHS,process control,yield management,etc.) to create a fully synchronized manufacturing environment to ensure the fab running with high availability, low inventory, high process stability and yield performance. This presentation discusses the potential role of optimization in such environment.
