Title: New Opportunities Based on Recent Experiences in Rail Crew Management<br>Author: Michael Forbes, CTO, Carmen Systems, Level 4, 54 Jephson Street, Toowong, QL, 4066, Australia, mforbes@carmensystems.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We analyse recent experiences in deploying crew management systems for strategic planning and day of operations at Amtrak and SNCF. The system deployed makes extensive use of optimisation and decision support and has facilitated significant process change.  We will highlight the benefits achieved at these railways.  Finally, we will  discuss how the same processes, with different time scales, can be used to achieve similar benefits at any other railway.  An opportunity not to be missed!
