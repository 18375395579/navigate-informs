Title: Capability Development Across Firm Boundaries: Comparing Offshore Outsourcing of R&D vs. IT Services<br>Author: Saikat Chaudhuri, Assistant Professor of Management, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 2029 Steinberg Hall-Dietrich Hall, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA, 19104-6370, United States of America, saikatc@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by globally disaggregating firms, we compare the performance drivers in the offshore outsourcing of more routinized, codified IT services with less routinized and codifiable R&D work, to identify the conditions under which more central tasks can be located outside. Our analysis of a sample of such projects by a leading vendor suggests that capability creation across firm boundaries is fruitful under certain organizational designs, bearing implications for notions of core vs. periphery.
