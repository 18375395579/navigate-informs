Title: An Integrated Framework to Model the Trajectories of Chronic Conditions<br>Author: Adel Alaeddini, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America, Adel.Alaeddini@utsa.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Nearly 75 million people in the United States have one or more chronic conditions, conditions that last a year or more and require ongoing medical attention and/or limit activities of daily living. While some patients display a stable trajectory over time, others display a trajectory of deterioration and/or improvement. The main objective of this research is to identify trajectories among patients with chronic conditions at baseline and describe patterns of trajectories.
