The analytical models  in this research characterize the reachability of a defined  Information Flow Network (IFN) while incorporating vehicular  lane-changing behavior and relative speed. The closed form  expressions for the expected node degree as well as the reachability  in an IFN are provided. Simulation models are developed to validate  the analytical results.</br>
