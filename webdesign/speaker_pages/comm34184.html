<br>Title: A GIS Scheduling System for Fuels Treatment Optimization in National Forests; A Look Under the Hood</br><br>Author: Matthew Niblett, University of California, Santa Barbara, 1832 Ellison Hall, UC Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106-4060, United States of America, mniblett@geog.ucsb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Church</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The United States Forest Service (USFS) uses fuels treatments to reduce the number and extent of high intensity forest fires in the western United States.  We present the details of integrating a fuels treatment scheduling model (FIRS) with a GIS database and visualization system. We describe specific issues that needed to be addressed in merging a large scale integer programming problem with GIS software.</br>
