Title: Data Mining in Diagnosis and Biomarker Identification of Alzheimer's Disease<br>Author: Hang Zhang, Postdoctoral Scholar, Arizona State University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States, hzhang12@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Min Bae<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present our preliminary research on applying artificial neural network (ANN) to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by using neuroimaging MRI data. Hierarchical clustering algorithm is then applied on the weights of the ANN hidden layer nodes to identify biomarkers of AD. Challenges and future research in fusing multi-source AD data are also discussed.
