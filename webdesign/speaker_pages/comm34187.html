Title: One Step at a Time: Impact of Separation on Multi-dimensional Decisions<br>Author: Karthik Ramachandran, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, Scheller College of Business, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, Karthik.Ramachandran@scheller.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yusen Xia<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An intuitive approach to minimize the complexity of multi-dimensional decisions is to separate the dimensions. We develop a model of joint and separated decision-making for bounded-rational agents, and conduct behavioral experiments to test our predictions.
