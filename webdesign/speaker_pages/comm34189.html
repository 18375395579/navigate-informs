We first study the impact of blog and music characteristics on sampling; then we examine the relationship between sampling/blog buzz and album sales. We gain insights on the role of blog influence and popularity on sampling in the body and tail of the sales distribution. Ongoing work uses Granger causality analysis to study the relationship between blog buzz and album sales for ‘independent?vs. ‘mainstream?music.
