<br>Title: A Multi-agent System Modeling on Agricultural Technology Adoption, Labor Mobility and Land Market</br><br>Author: Lin Zhang, Penn State University, UNIVERSITY PARK, State College, PA, 16686, United States of America, luz1@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jill Findeis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A multi-agent system is used to simulate new agricultural technology diffusion and explore different possible scenarios coupled with household characteristics under certain markets conditions. Simulation results provide insight into 1) the economic strategies relative to rural labor mobility and time allocation decision, 2) agricultural land leasing market conditions in underdeveloped regions, and 3) technology adoption constraints.</br>
