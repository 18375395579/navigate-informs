We propose that the impact of a hospital teaching status on its service quality can vary across hospitals of different sizes. We use a new large dataset that measures objective operations quality on the treatment for three conditions in all major US hospitals. Our results suggest that the impact of teaching intensity on quality is dependent upon the specifics of each condition and might vary with hospital size.
