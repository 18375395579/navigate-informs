Title: British OR in the Peace (1945-1970)<br>Author: Graham Rand, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom, g.rand@lancaster.ac.uk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This presentation arises from two contributions to the Gass and Fu encyclopedia. OR in WWII is well documented.  Less well known is what happened next.  In the UK, OR was taken up in the nationalized industries and in private companies, but did not make much impact in the public sector.  This diffusion of OR was helped by the creation of the OR Club which became the OR Society, of which Saul Gass was a member.  Key aspects of the development of OR in this period will be highlighted.
