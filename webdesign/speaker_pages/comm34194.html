Title: Case Study in Ohio Establishing Voting Allocation Methods For the USA<br>Author: Theodore Allen, Associate Professor, Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, allen.515@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mike Bernshteyn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe our real world case study to apply queuing theory and operations research that will affect approximately one half million people in Franklin County Ohio, where Columbus is. We show how pretty good allocation based on machine utilization will likely avoid the discrimination experienced in 2004. We also describe how simulation generated a useful warning spurring helpful actions by government and campaign officials.
