Title: Developing Fair and Feasible Schedules for Residents On-Call<br>Author: Sarah Root, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, seroot@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Scheduling medical resident call shifts is challenging because of the many complex, competing feasibility rules to be satisfied. Furthermore, finding a feasible schedule is not enough, because it may be very imbalanced across residents. We present a scheduling approach that incorporates both feasibility and fairness and show real-world computational results.
