<br>Title: Establishing the Link Between Climate Change and the Frequency of Hurricane Landfalls</br><br>Author: Roshanak Nateghi, Miss, JHU, 511 Ames, 3400 N Charles, Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States of America, roshanak.nateghi@googlemail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven Quiring, Seth Guikema</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Hurricanes pose significant risk to power systems. Therefore it is of crucial importance to be able to predict their frequency and intensity. The collected data consists of counts of the hurricane landfalls in the Atlantic Coast and Gulf Region of the U.S. One particular challenging aspect of the data is the excess number of zero counts. We develop statistical models for estimating the impact of Climate Change on the frequency and intensity of hurricanes landfalls.</br>
