In this presentation, this advice is analyzed from the perspective of the user.  Advice on preparing a shelter in the home is subjected to a household cost-benefit test.  Advice on sheltering vs. fleeing is evaluated in light of expectations for the dispersion of radioactive fallout and speed of flight.  Finally, official advice is assessed for completeness.
