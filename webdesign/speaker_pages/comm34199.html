Title: Product Reuse in Industries with Radical Innovations<br>Author: Vedat Verter, Prof, Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, H3A 1G5, Canada, vedat.verter@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mathijn Retel Helmrich, Tamer Boyaci<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study how a firm’s decision of whether or not to reuse products is influenced by innovations taking place in the industry, especially when these innovations are not only incremental in nature, but there is also a chance that a radical innovation will take place, thereby changing consumer’s valuations of reused products, which do not contain this radical innovation. A Markov decision process is used to model the firm’s various decisions.
