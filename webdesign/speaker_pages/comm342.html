Winkler</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Under simple preference assumptions that may be reasonable in many circumstances, an individual’s utility function should be mixex, which is a mixture of exponential utilities. We discuss some characteristics of mixex utility in the single-attribute case. For the multiattribute case, we explore connections of mixex utility to utility and preference independence assumptions, as well as  practical issues related to the assessment and modeling of multiattribute utility.</br>
