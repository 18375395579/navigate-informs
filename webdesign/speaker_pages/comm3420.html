Hausman, Dariush Rafinejad</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Worldwide, 30-40% of food is wasted at all levels of the supply chain - approximately 1.3 billion tonnes -  and every kilo or tonne of that food generates at least 4.5 times that amount of carbon dioxide emissions which could have been avoided. By taking a supply chain perspective, this talk explores how to model the food distribution, taking into account environmental externalities, and how improving system operations or influencing strategic consumer behavior could help mitigate food waste.</br>
