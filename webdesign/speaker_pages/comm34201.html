Title: The Sourcing Hub and Supplier Networks<br>Author: Anupam Agrawal, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Champaign, Champaign, IL, United States of America, anupam@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Arnoud Meyer, Luk Van Wassenhove<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this paper, We explore the concept of the sourcing hub. We model non-cooperative and cooperative sourcing hub scenarios, anchoring to our three-year empirical work and examine the resulting profits along the supply chain. Overall, my results show that active management of upstream sourcing can add value to supply chains.
