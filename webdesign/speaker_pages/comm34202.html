Title: Novelty Detection based on Distance and Topological Relation<br>Author: Sungzoon Cho, Professor, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, zoon@snu.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Pilsung Kang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A distance-based novelty detector classifies a new data pattern as novel if its distance to normal patterns is larger than a threshold.  It is intuitive, is easy to understand and implement, and fits naturally with incremental leaning. Yet, its performance is limited since it relies on distance only.  In this talk, we propose a new distance measure that takes topological relation into consideration.  A preliminary experiment is promising.
