Firms are increasingly able to design electronic selling mechanisms that re-veal, conceal, bias, and distort market information. We present a research agenda on the topic of market transparency for information-intensive industries where many firms are developing in-novative technologies to implement strategies exploiting the quantity and quality of information provided to consumers.</br>
