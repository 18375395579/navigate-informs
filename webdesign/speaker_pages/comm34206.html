<br>Title: Power Approximations in Network Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Dan Adelman, Professor of Operations Management, University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, 5807 S. Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, dan.adelman@chicagobooth.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christiane Barz, Canan Uckun</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a new approximation architecture for the network revenue management problem using power functions to express concavity. We address a number of technical challenges in fitting parameters and demonstrate numerical performance compared against other approximations.</br>
