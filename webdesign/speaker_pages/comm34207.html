<br>Title: Optimal Timing for a Paired Organ Exchange</br><br>Author: Andrew Schaefer, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, schaefer@ie.pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Kaufman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In March 2007 the Supreme Court ruled that it is legal for transplant recipients with incompatible donors to swap organs. We consider the timing decision faced by two recipient-donor pairs of when to undergo a simultaneous exchange. The decision is modeled as a two-player nonzero-sum game in which recipient health states follow Markov processes. The optimal actions are compared to several alternative policies. Structural results and a numerical study using clinical data for livers are presented.</br>
