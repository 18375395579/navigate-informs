Title: The Effect of Near-miss Events on Future Hurricane Evacuation Decisions<br>Author: Robin Dillon-Merrill, Georgetown University, 418 Old North, Washington, DC, 20057, United States of America, rld9@georgetown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cathy Tinsley, Matthew Cronin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We formalize the concept of near-misses and consider the impact of such events on hurricane evacuation decisions.  We show that near-misses with no evidence of “almost failure?make people feel safer about the situation.  This lower level of perceived risk encourages people with near-miss information to make riskier subsequent decisions.
