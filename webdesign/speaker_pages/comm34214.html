Title: How Does Continuous Auditing and Monitoring Impact Employees?Intentions to Commit Fraud?<br>Author: France Bélanger, Professor, Virginia Tech, 3007 Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, belanger@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kathy Enget<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Employee fraud has a potentially broad impact. Continuous auditing and monitoring (CA/CM) can be a valuable tool in this situation.  This research explores CA/CM impacts on the fraud triangle via interviews and then with a vignette-based survey.  The proposed vignettes focus on a manager needing to meet sales targets.  With CA/CM, we expect to find lower intentions to commit fraud, lower perceived opportunities, no change in perceived pressures, and no change or lower ability to justify fraud.
