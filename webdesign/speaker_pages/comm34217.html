Title: Importance Measures for Inland Waterway Network Resilience<br>Author: Hiba Baroud, PhD Student, University of Oklahoma, 202 West Boyd St, Rm. 124, Norman, OK, 73019, United States of America, hbaroud@ou.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kash Barker, Jose Emmanuel Ramirez-Marquez, Claudio Rocco<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Inland waterways are critical elements in supply chains, allowing for the flow of commodities across industries and geographic locations. This work presents stochastic resilience-based importance measures that highlight the critical waterway links that contribute to waterway network resilience and uses them to motivate the order in which links should be recovered. A data-driven case study illustrates these metrics to describe commodity flows along the various links of the US Mississippi River.
