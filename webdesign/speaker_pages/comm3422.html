Title: Revenue-monotonicity in Combinatorial Auctions<br>Author: Marion Ott, RWTH Aachen University, Templergraben 64, Aachen, 52062, Germany, marion.ott@rwth-aachen.de<br>Coauthor(s): Marissa Beck<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Under what conditions does revenue in sealed-bid combinatorial auctions decrease when bids increase? We investigate revenue-(non)monotonicity in the Vickrey Package Auction and Core-Selecting Auctions. In the Vickrey auction and in Minimum-Revenue Core-Selecting Auctions this counterintuitive phenomenon may appear even if we restrict bidders' values to be submodular and under further restrictions.
