Title: Capacity Management for Online Appointment Scheduling<br>Author: Bo Zhang, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Route 134, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, zhangbo@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Nan Liu, Peter van de Ven<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Consider an electronic patient appointment booking system for making online reservations. The system displays a set of available time slots and the patient selects an acceptable slot or leaves if none are acceptable. We propose blocking popular slots during initial stages, 'forcing' early patients to select less popular ones and increasing long-term utilization. We study the tradeoff between losing early patients (blocking too long) and having little flexibility later on (blocking too little).
