Title: Value Transference and Brand Management in Pharmaceuticals<br>Author: Israel Zang, Professor, The Tel Aviv Yafo Academic College, 29 Melchet St., Tel Aviv, Israel, israelza@mta.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): James Conley, Morton Kamien<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: While patent protection is time limited, a trademark is indefinite, and trademarking a drug creates value transferable to new drugs. We consider the question of whether an incumbent patented and trademarked drug producer, facing generic competition, and introducing an improved drug, will choose to leave the trademark with the old drug or to transfer it to its newer version. We characterize the equilibrium solutions, their effects, and whether a sandwich pricing strategy will be employed.
