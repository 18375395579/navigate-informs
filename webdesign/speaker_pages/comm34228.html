Title: Operational Information and Decision Analysis for Missile Defense Engagements: Model-Based Approach<br>Author: Jay Finn, Principal Systems Engineer, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, 235 Presidential Way, Woburn, MA, 01801, United States of America, jayfinn@raytheon.com<br>Coauthor(s): Bobbi Young, Dan Gernert, Karyn Furlong<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The BMDS operational architecture includes pre-planned engagement decisions executed independently without coordination between elements to optimize BMDS capabilities. Our goal was to model the operational architecture to understand information needs for time critical decisions. This presentation discusses our approach combining operational processes, architecture models, and timeline analysis, to identify opportunities to increase performance of future BMDS architectures.
