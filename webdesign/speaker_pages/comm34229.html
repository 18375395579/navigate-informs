<br>Title: Automatically Generating Public Policies from Contact Networks</br><br>Author: Mario Ventresca, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Rd, Toronto, Canada, mario.ventresca@utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dionne Aleman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A goal of understanding diffusion of infectious diseases through a population is to create better public health policies to mitigate the disease. We present an approach that utilizes machine learning methods as a means to automatically propose such policies from identified critical nodes to vaccinate in a contact network representation of the Greater Toronto Area. The network is constructed from publicly available census data, and is easily adapted to other populations.</br>
