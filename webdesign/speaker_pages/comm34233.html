Although women transition to entrepreneurship at lower rates than men, they are more likely to pursue alternative venturing routes available inside an established organization. The results further indicate that higher rates of female intrapreneurship are unlikely to arise because of gender differences in risk-taking behaviors, differential sorting, and differential labor supply. Instead, I find evidence consistent with the notion that women tend to pursue internal venturing options because such tasks match their skills and lifestyle choices.</br>
