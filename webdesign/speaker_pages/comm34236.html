Title: Enhancing Army Aviation Readiness<br>Author: Stan Horowitz, shorowitz@ida.org<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Levine, Christopher Hanks<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This work examines two topics related to improving the readiness of Army helicopters. The first addresses the efficacy of special helicopter maintenance programs that are more extensive than normal depot overhaul. They will be evaluated in terms of how much mission capable rates improved. The second topic compares spares packages designed by several methodologies. Statistical analysis will attempt to show which approach is likely to yield the highest readiness.
