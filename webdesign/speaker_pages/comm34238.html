<br>Title: Smart Charging of Electric Vehicles using Intelligent Software Agents</br><br>Author: Konstantina Valogianni, PhD Candidate, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, Netherlands, kvalogianni@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Collins, Wolf Ketter</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The introduction of Electric Vehicles in the existing Energy Grid raises many issues regarding energy Grid's stability. We examine the effect of EVs introduction in the energy grid. We model the driving profiles and charging attitude of the individuals. We prove that there exist economic benefits for individuals who are more risk taking compared to the risk averse ones.  Finally, we propose a smart charging strategy that improves the social welfare and enhances grid’s stability and reliability.</br>
