Title: Estimating the Patient's Price of Privacy in Liver Transplantation<br>Author: Burhaneddin Sandikci, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15217, United States, bus2@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Oguzhan Alagoz, Lisa Maillart, Andrew Schaefer, Mark Roberts<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In the United States, ESLD patients join a waiting list for cadaveric liver transplantation. The details of the composition of this list are not publicly available. We consider the benefits associated with creating a more transparent list by studying the organ accept/reject decision as a Markov decision process. We define the concept of the patient's price of privacy to measure the cost of keeping the list private. We also present the results of numerical experiments based on clinical data.
