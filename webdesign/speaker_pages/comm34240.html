<br>Title: Blueprint for Effective Patient Flow</br><br>Author: Renata Kopach, Doctoral Student and Graduate Researcher, Purdue University, 315 North Grant, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States, rkopach@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Narayanan Varadarajan, Imran Hasan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Patient flow impacts the delivery of care and a hospital’s budget. The two primary factors impeding flow are the lack of real-time communication and inefficient bed assignment. In an effort to smooth patient flow 'state transparency' technology can be employed.  Using trace data from this technology we seek to recreate representative patient care paths. Our objective is to develop a tool capable anticipating how the patient load will tend to change in the near future given the current flow.</br>
