Title: On Applications of Digital Fountain Codes<br>Author: Michael Mitzenmacher, Harvard, 33 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States, michaelm@eecs.harvard.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Fountain codes were originally designed for multicast applications, but have since been proposed for several other related applications.  We review major potential applications of fountain codes, focusing on the potential benefits coding gives over solutions without coding.  We also discuss the impediments to fountain code adoption, and consider the tradeoffs between fountain codes and network coding.
