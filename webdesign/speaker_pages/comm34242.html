<br>Title: Teaching Optimization Modeling to Future OR Practitioners Using SAS</br><br>Author: Manoj Chari, Director, Operations Research R&D, SAS Institute, 100 SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC, 27513, United States, Manoj.Chari@sas.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ed Hughes</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: PROC OPTMODEL in SAS/OR is a natural tool for teaching optimization modeling due to its access to a wide range of solvers and its high-level programming features.  SAS also provides data access and manipulation, analytical, and reporting capabilities that always accompany optimization use in practical settings.  All are included in the new “SAS OnDemand for Academics?program, which provides quick, easy, affordable access to SAS for coursework use by faculty and students.</br>
