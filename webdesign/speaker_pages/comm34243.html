<br>Title: A Quantitative Measurement of Regret Theory</br><br>Author: Alessandra Cillo, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, F-77300, France, Alessandra.CILLO@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Han Bleichrodt, Enrico Diecidue</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative measurement of regret theory. Our method is choice-based and requires no assumptions about the shape of functions reflecting utility and regret. The event-splitting effects could not confound our results. Our findings are consistent with the assumptions of regret theory although some deviations are found.</br>
