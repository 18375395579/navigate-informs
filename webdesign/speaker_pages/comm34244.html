Title: Dynamic Decision Making Problems When There are Different Levels of Model Uncertainty<br>Author: Andrew Lim, Associate Professor, IEOR Department, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, lim@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): George Shantikumar, Peng Li<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider intensity control problems with different levels of uncertainty for different random factors. We establish a new duality result within this setting which shows how tradeoffs should be made in decision making when there are different uncertainty levels between different factors.
