Title: Production Planning of Returned Products at Pitney Bowes<br>Author: Mark Ferguson, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Management, 800 W. Peachtree Street NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States, Mark.Ferguson@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gilvan Souza, Daniel Guide<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: At Pitney Bowes, product returns to their remanufacturing facility are categorized into a finite number of quality categories corresponding to an increasing cost to remanufacture as the quality of the return decreases. We modified their traditional MRP planning system to account for this unique aspect of a remanufacturing environment.  This modification resulted in several million dollar savings compared to their old method of scheduling remanufactured products.
