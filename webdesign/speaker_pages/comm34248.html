Title: Transitional Hydrogen Supply Chain Modeling<br>Author: Scott Grasman, Associate Professor, Missouri S&T, 230 EMSE, Rolla, MO, 65409, United States of America, grasmans@mst.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This presentation highlights research that addresses the need for a viable transition to hydrogen infrastructure (and as a consequence, reduction in supply chain costs).  These models attempt to capture the benefits of phased development, while addressing the questions related to early feasible introduction locations, and how the introduction of hydrogen technologies in these locations affects continued introduction of hydrogen technologies on a local, regional, and national basis.
