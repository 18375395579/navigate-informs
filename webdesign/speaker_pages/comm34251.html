Title: A Mixed-integer Programming Tool for Creating Effective Schematic Urban Transit Maps<br>Author: Olufolajimi Oke, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 N Charles Street, Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States of America, ooke1@jhu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sauleh Siddiqui<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Schematic maps underpin sustainable urban transit networks. Effective maps facilitate user navigation by balancing topographical representation and accessibility. We have built upon recent schematic map automation efforts by developing an improved mathematical model and computational enhancements to create a versatile drawing tool for better interactions across a variety of systems.
