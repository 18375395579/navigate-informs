Title: Dynamic Abandon/ Extract Decisions for Failed Cardiac Leads<br>Author: Anahita Khojandi, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, United States of America, ank83@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Maillart, Oleg Prokopyev, Mark Roberts, Samir Saba<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Physicians must immediately implant a new cardiac lead for every lead that fails and extract all implanted leads if infection occurs. When a failure occurs, physicians may elect to extract the newly failed lead and/or any previously abandoned leads to (1) maintain space in the artery and (2) limit the leads dwell-times, the most critical factor in extraction complication. We develop Markov decision process models to determine patient-specific extraction policies for various cardiac device types.
