<br>Title: Schematic Representation of Some Flow Shop Scheduling Problems</br><br>Author: S.S. Panwalkar, Johns Hopkins University, 100 International Drive,, Baltimore, MD, 21202, United States of America, panwalkar@jhu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christos Koulamas</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The classical minimum makespan flow shop model and its variations involving three or more machines have been generally found to be NP hard. In analyzing these models, many researchers have proposed various schematic diagrams representing a specific schedule. While such diagrams cannot directly result in solutions, they do help provide a better understanding of the problem structure. In this paper we discuss various flow shop problem formulations and schematics including some new ones.</br>
