Based on a Contract Switching Paradigm, in this paper, we develop a forward contracting mechanism, with a bailout feature that is responsive to congestion states when service delivery is infeasible. The contracting scheme is analyzaed for its economic benefits and robustness. These new contracts can be used as an effective tool for risk management by service providers.</br>
