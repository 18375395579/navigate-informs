A Game Theoretic Perspective</br><br>Author: Bo Zeng, Postdoctoral Research Associate, Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, bzeng@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Zhao, Mark Lawley</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Clinic overbooking has been proposed to reduce the negative effect of patient no-shows. However, patient responses have been neglected in various overbooking algorithms. We develop game theoretic models to investigate the interactions between clinics and patients and derive conditions under which there is unique Nash Equilibrium or multiple equilibria. We further discuss cases where overbooking is beneficial when patient responses are considered.</br>
