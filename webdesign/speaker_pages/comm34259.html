<br>Title: Improving the Robustness of Demand Over Lead-time Calculations</br><br>Author: Darryl Ahner, Air Force Institute of Technology, 2905 Hobson Way, WPAFB, OH, 45433, United States of America, darryl.ahner@afit.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Demand over lead time calculation using the assumption of normality is well know. Unfortunately, the normality assumption is often violated. This talk discusses a simple yet effective variation of determining point estimates of the mean and variance that increase the robustness of the calculation.</br>
