Increasingly, stakeholders get interested in the impact of BPC on the extent to which these processes generate value for them. The objective of this conceptual study is to develop a model for understanding the impact of BPC on the value generated by business processes. Drawing on analytics research, we conceptualize and relate stakeholder expectations, business process (performance), and ostensive and performative BPC.
