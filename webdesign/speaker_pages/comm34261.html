<br>Title: The Effect of Human Behavior in Supply Chain Performance: A Control Theoretic Study</br><br>Author: Maximiliano Udenio, PhD Student, Eindhoven University of Technology, PO Box 513, PAV F14, Eindhoven, 5600MB, Netherlands, m.udenio@tue.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jan Fransoo, Eleni Vatamidou, Nico Dellaert</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We use linear control theory to analyze the performance of a firm generating material orders as a function of the difference between actual inventory and pipeline and their respective targets. We explicitly model managerial behavior by allowing fractional –instead of full?adjustments to be performed in each period, thus introducing a proxy to the firms?reactiveness to changes.  We illustrate the practical importance of this research by including links to empirical and experimental data.</br>
