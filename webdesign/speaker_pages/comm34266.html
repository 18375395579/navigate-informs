This feature, however, comes at a cost as versatile capacity is more expensive than dedicated one. This trade-off received much attention recently and has been explored while implicitly treating the process as a single stage. This study considers this trade-off within a multi-stage context and identifies which stages along the process should be flexible (or dedicated) and their optimal capacity levels.</br>
