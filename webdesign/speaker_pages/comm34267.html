<br>Title: Software Design Strategies in Markets with Open Source Competitors</br><br>Author: Sri Narasimhan, Senior Associate Dean, Georgia Tech, 800 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, sri.narasimhan@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhe Qu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We model one aspect of the strategic interaction between proprietary software vendors (PRVs) and their open source software(OSS) counterparts. Specifically, we study how the availability of an OSS shapes a PRV’s software design strategy. The findings imply that in software markets characterized by high demand for service, PRVs could introduce more basic versions of their software in response to the growth of their OSS counterparts.</br>
