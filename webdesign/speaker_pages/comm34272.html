Rardin, Professor, Purdue University, Industrial Engineering, W. Lafayette, IN, 47907-2022, United States, rardin@purdue.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Healthcare delivery in the United States is in a crisis of inconsistent and sometimes dismal quality, safety and efficiency, with exploding cost. A major reason for these shortfalls is the lack of sufficient involvement from the operations researchers and management scientists who have done so much to improve the effectiveness of manufacturing and distribution operations. Nothing should be more exciting than a critical national challenge to which the tools of OR/MS are so well adapted.</br>
