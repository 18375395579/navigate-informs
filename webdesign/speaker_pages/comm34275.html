Title: BANTER: Anything Interesting Going On Out There in the Blogosphere?<br>Author: Claudia Perlich, T.J. Watson IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, RTE 134, Yorktown Heights, United States of America, perlich@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Social media marketing is of extreme relevance in today’s dynamic market environment. The youngest and by traditional means least understood is the Web 2.0 media. Marketing groups are very curious to learn what people in general and their customers in particular are saying in their blogs, how the expressed opinions could impact business, and how to extract business insight and value from these blogs. The BANTER (Blog Analysis of Network Topology and Evolving) system integrates a number of different analytical and machine learning techniques including active and transfer learning to provide an effective tool to support marketing with insights from the Blogosphere. We will address the 4 main components: 1) The identification of a RELEVANT subset of the 77M size blog universe, 2) the identification of authorities in this sub-universe, 3) the analysis of the relevance and sentiment of the expressed opinions and 4) the detection of emerging hot topics and themes.
