Title: En Route Trends in the National Airspace System<br>Author: Antoine Charles, Antoine.Charles@faa.gov<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: En Route metrics are pivotal to understanding the performance of the NAS (National Airspace System). Critical decisions must be made about capacity and workload, and reliable data is required to support these decisions. We will observe NAS trends, measure changes within the NAS, and identify the driving factors of change.  Using the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS), we measure changes in the NAS, as a whole, and proceed to observe changes its components.
