Title: A Day in the Saddle Can Take its Toll<br>Author: Bradley Staats, Univrsity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, Bradley_Staats@kenan-flagler.unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hengchen Dai, Katy Milkman, Dave Hofmann<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: To deliver services safely, organizations develop professional standards. Despite the reinforcement of these standards, they are often not followed. In this paper we examine: (1) compliance to standards; (2) how high job demands may decrease compliance; (3) whether longer breaks increase compliance. We tested these hypotheses using longitudinal field observations of over 4,157 caregivers?in healthcare whose compliance with hand hygiene guidelines was recorded on 13.7 million occasions.
