<br>Title: Optimal Referral Bonuses with Asymmetric Information: Firm-Offered and Interpersonal Incentives</br><br>Author: Laura Kornish, Assistant Professor, Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado, UCB 419, Boulder, CO, 80305, United States of America, kornish@colorado.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Qiuping Li</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Referral bonuses are currently a popular way to stimulate word-of-mouth in some categories. We analyze optimal bonuses and pricing, when people’s reasons for making product recommendations include placing value on a friend having a positive experience with a product they recommend. We find that in many cases, the more that people care about the outcomes of their recommendations, the higher the referral bonus should be. However, if people care enough about others, the firm should not use bonuses.</br>
