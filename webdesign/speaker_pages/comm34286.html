For instance, we now know that systems as disparate as the World Wide Web, scientific collaborations, food webs, protein interactions and metabolism all have common features in their organization. I will discuss how network approaches can elucidate the organization of cellular function, and illustrate with examples of multiple large-scale datasets.</br>
