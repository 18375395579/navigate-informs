Title: Dissecting Organizational Knowledge: Multimodal Apprenticeship in Vascular Surgery<br>Author: Curtis LeBaron, Associate Professor, Brigham Young University, 790 Tanner Building, Marriott School, Provo, UT, 84602, United States, LeBaron@byu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This is a video-based study of instruction within a surgical team. The attending surgeon, who is most expert, provides subtle visible and vocal prompts for the work of the resident, who is a novice. Such “scaffolding?behaviors are a form of practice that emerge organically within surgical activity, supporting the novice’s performance as needed and to the extent needed, disappearing into the folds of interaction as the resident develops expertise.
