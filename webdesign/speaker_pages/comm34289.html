We study how HP can manage its dual sales channels: a direct channel, hpshopping.com, alongside an independent retail channel. We determine optimum channel policies for HP under different channel scenarios. To this end, we develop a game-theoretic model and an experimental study. The approach allows HP to test channel policies with human decision makers before implementing it in the market place.</br>
