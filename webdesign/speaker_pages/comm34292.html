Title: Hierarchy, Team Familiarity, and Capability Development: Evidence from Indian Software Services<br>Author: Brad Staats, Doctoral Candidate, Harvard Business School, Morgan Hall 428B, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, bstaats@hbs.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: I explore how hierarchical team familiarity (managers?experience with engineers) and horizontal team familiarity (engineers experience with one another) influence the development of organizational capabilities. I also consider whether these familiarity measures moderate the relationship between project complexity and performance. Using longitudinal data on software projects (over 1,100 projects & 13,000 individuals), I show that capabilities grow through the strengthening of individual ties.
