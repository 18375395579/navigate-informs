Collaboration requirements are not captured in the standard procedure to identify bottlenecks and theoretical capacity. We introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable idleness and identify a special class of collaboration architectures that have no unavoidable idleness. We show that collaboration introduces subtleties also to questions of flexibility investment.</br>
