Title: Collaboration in Networks: Architectures, Bottlenecks and Throughput<br>Author: Itai Gurvich, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, i-gurvich@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study networks where some activities require the simultaneous collaboration of multiple human resources. Collaboration requirements are not captured in the standard procedure to identify bottlenecks and theoretical capacity. We introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable idleness and identify a special class of collaboration architectures that have no unavoidable idleness. We show that collaboration introduces subtleties also to questions of flexibility investment.
