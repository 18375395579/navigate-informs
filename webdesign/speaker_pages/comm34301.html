Title: Finding Better Pricing Strategies For Electricity<br>Author: Mingguo Hong, Midwest ISO, 5407 Alvamar Place, Carmel, IN, 46033, United States of America, mingguoh@hotmail.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Location Marginal Price (LMP) based electricity market design has an inherent weakness in that it cannot guarantee the recovery of a generator’s startup and no load costs. As a result, the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) would have to provide make-whole payment in settlement. RTOs in North America have made various design changes to improve pricing. This talk reviews the market design changes. It intends to reveal issues with LMP pricing and solicit alternative problem solutions.
