<br>Title: Supply Chain Resilience</br><br>Author: Ivan Hernandez, Stevens Institute of Technology, 167 8th Street, Apt 4, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States of America, ihernand@stevens.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jose Ramirez-Marquez, David Nowicki</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a method that allows decision makers to ensure a Supply Chain (SC) returns to a high level of performance following a contingency.  We introduce the concept of SC resilience as a function of the post-event investment resources needed for the SC to “bounce back?  The concepts can be used as a guide for companies to use their long-term SC plan as a starting point, then begin to ask themselves what they would do if various contingencies occur.</br>
