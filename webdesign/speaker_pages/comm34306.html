Title: Mixed Integer Programming: Analyzing 12 Years of Progress<br>Author: Roland Wunderling, IBM, Annenstrasse 9, Graz, 8020, Austria, roland.wunderling@at.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Tobias Achterberg<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk we outline an unbiased way to analyze benchmark results and  apply this scheme to assess the contribution of the main components in CPLEX 12.5 to the ability to solve MIPs. We highlight some of the more recent features, in particular the deterministic parallel optimizer.
