Bihar state in India has the highest Leishmaniasis mortality rate in the world. Currently DDT (for controlling Leishmaniasis) is distributed (37.5 grams per individual, under WHO guidelines) according to human population size only, without considering cattle population size. Is this process of insecticide distribution optimal? Our research explores this question by using optimization models.
