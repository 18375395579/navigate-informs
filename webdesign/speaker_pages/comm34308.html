Title: The Distributional Effect of Distance-based Road User Charges<br>Author: Lei Zhang, Assistant Professor, Oregon State University, School of Civil & Construction Engineering, 220 Owen Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331, United States of America, imleich@yahoo.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Distance-based fees have been proposed as viable alternatives to traditional fuel taxes for long-term funding sustainability. The existing vehicle ownership structure, however, has caused concerns that the transition from fuel taxes to distance-based fees may benefit the high-income drivers at the expense of low-income groups. This paper analyzes the distributional effect of distance-based fees by income and residential location with regression and choice models.
