The existing vehicle ownership structure, however, has caused concerns that the transition from fuel taxes to distance-based fees may benefit the high-income drivers at the expense of low-income groups. This paper analyzes the distributional effect of distance-based fees by income and residential location with regression and choice models.</br>
