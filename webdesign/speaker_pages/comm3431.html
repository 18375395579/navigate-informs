<br>Title: Multi-Objective Optimization as an Aid to Sell Non-Timber Forest Benefits in New Zealand</br><br>Author: Sandor Toth, Assistant Professor, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States, sft108@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Many argue that developing a capability to value and market the environmental benefits of forests could alleviate some of the problems associated with forest degradation and land-use conversions. Multi-objective harvest scheduling models can help landowners sell non-timber forest benefits by quantifying the tradeoffs and opportunity costs of producing these services. We will demonstrate how biodiversity and carbon credits could be marketed using this approach in New Zealand.</br>
