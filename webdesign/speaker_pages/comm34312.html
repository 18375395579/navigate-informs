Title: A Fitness Landscape Analysis of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem<br>Author: Jean-Paul Watson, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800, MS 1110, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1110, United States, jwatson@sandia.gov<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Despite the existence of innumerable metaheuristics for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), almost nothing is known about the structure of the underlying fitness landscape. We explore the CVRP fitness landscape, and use the insight gained to provide formal insight into the underlying reasons for the superior performance of state-of-the-art CVRP metaheuristics, specifically emphasizing tabu search procedures.
