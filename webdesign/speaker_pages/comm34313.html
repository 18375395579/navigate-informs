<br>Title: Design and Operation of Closed-loop Supply Chains: Practical Aspects and Analytical Models</br><br>Author: Elif Akcali, Associate Professor, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States of America, akcali@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Halit Uster, Sila Cetinkaya</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The increased popularity of remanufacturing requires firms to design and operate efficient closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) systems. In this talk, we will provide a critique of the existing literature on network design and inventory and production planning for CLSC systems. We examine the degree to which the existing quantitative models address the practical challenges encountered in industry. We also discuss new research avenues that will aid in the practical implementation of remanufacturing.</br>
