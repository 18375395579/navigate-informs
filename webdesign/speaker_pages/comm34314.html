It is possibly the world's most attractive soccer tournament. Devising optimal schedules is crucial to players, teams, fans, sponsors, and administrators. Fair and balanced schedules are a major issue. We describe the problem formulation and its solution approach. We also report on the practical experience gathered after scheduling the tournament for three years.</br>
