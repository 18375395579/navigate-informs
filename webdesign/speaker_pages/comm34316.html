Title: A Service Quality Perspective on Staff Schedules in Hospitals<br>Author: Felix Miedaner, University of Cologne, Albertus Magnus Place, Cologne, Germany, felix.miedaner@uni-koeln.de<br>Coauthor(s): Ludwig Kuntz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Recent research indicates that decisions on staff schedules not only influence costs, but also staff behavior and medical outcomes. We complement this research by identifying structures of staff schedules which are linked to treatment quality. Specifically, we ask whether staffing levels and daily staffing changes are associated with medical outcomes. We report on the results of a pilot study in two neonatal intensive care units.
