We review and discuss the suitability of assumptions made across such models from a descriptive point of view. We explore the modeling implications by drawing knowledge from fields surrounding terrorism. We present a way of addressing some of these areas: dynamic priorities, utilities and beliefs using MCDA and System Dynamics.</br>
