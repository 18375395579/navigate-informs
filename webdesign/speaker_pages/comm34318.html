We begin by explaining a specific macro, Data Generator, which mainly helps statistics instructors to create assignment questions where data sets used in the questions are randomly generated according to the instructor’s instructions.  We then describe a more general approach.  We also provide a suggested procedure to help instructors grade the students?answers automatically.
