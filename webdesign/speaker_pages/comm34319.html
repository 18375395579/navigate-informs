<br>Title: The Performance of Virtual Stock Markets in Institutional Forecasting</br><br>Author: Gary Lilien, Distinguished Research Professor of Management Science, Penn State University, 484 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, glilien@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gerrit Van Bruggen, Martin Spann, Bernd Skiera</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the performance of Virtual Stock Markets (VSMs) in institutional forecasting. We find that VSMs can be effectively applied in an environment with a small number of knowledgeable informants. Our results show that where there is high knowledge-heterogeneity, the VSM outperforms the Combined Judgmental Forecasts approach. Our results provide insight into when each of the approaches might be most effectively applied.</br>
