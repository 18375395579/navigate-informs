Title: Creating and Resolving Flux in Team Action Processes<br>Author: David Cantor, Assistant Professor, Iowa State University, 2340 Gerdin Business Bldg, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, dcantor@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Summers<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Supply chains have seen an increase in team-based work structures.  We investigate how cross-functional supply chain teams manage responses to stretch work in a SAP simulation game.  Using a sample 300 undergraduate students (100 3-person teams), we examine how team structure and individual differences impact team processes and performance in the hyper-competitive SAP simulation environment. Preliminary results and findings will be discussed.
