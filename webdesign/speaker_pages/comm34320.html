<br>Title: Election Projections: A Retrospective</br><br>Author: Jack Moshman, Moshman Associates</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The art of projecting elections has come a long way since 1960.  We had a paper-bound, limited memory technology that estimated a  probability that one designated political party would capture the White House.  Inputs were past statistical relationships, informed opinion and actual voting behavior as reported on Election Night.  We now have no paper, a procedure of tallying electoral vote state by state, and a major reliance on exit polling.   The  author, who was in charge of election-night projections for NBC and then ABC from 1960 through 2000, recounts how the process has evolved.</br>
