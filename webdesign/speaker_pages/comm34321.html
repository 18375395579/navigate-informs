Title: Social Capital and the Creation of Knowledge<br>Author: Claudia Gonzalez-Brambila, Business School, Instituto Technologico Autonomo, Rio Hondo 1, Mexico, D.F., 01000, Mexico, cgonzalez@itam.mx<br>Coauthor(s): Krackhardt David, Francisco Veloso<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We examine the relation between knowledge creation, measured through published papers, and social capital, characterized through co-authorship.  Using an extensive panel, analysis suggests that, contrary to previous results, structural holes are not significant; what matters are direct ties, being central, working across areas of knowledge, and being in non dense networks.
