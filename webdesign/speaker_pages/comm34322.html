Title: Applying Constraint Programming to Workforce Management of Highly-skilled Employees<br>Author: Yossi Richter, IBM Research, Haifa University Campus, Haifa, Israel, RICHTER@il.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Yehuda Naveh, Donna Gresh, Daniel Connors<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Today many companies face the challenge of matching highly-skilled professionals to  high-end jobs, while maximizing the number of accomplished jobs.  Unlike traditional Workforce Management problems such as shift-scheduling,   employees are considered distinguishable and non-interchangeable.  We describe a mature tool based on Constraint Programming, and elaborate on its novel infrastructure and unique features. We provide  strong experimental results to support its usability.
