<br>Title: Blockbuster Culture's Next Rise or Fall: The Impact of Recommender Systems on Sales Diversity</br><br>Author: Kartik Hosanagar, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, PA, kartikh@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Fleder</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine the effect of recommender systems on the diversity of sales. We find that some common recommenders based on collaborative filtering can lead to a net reduction in sales diversity. Further, it is possible for individual-level diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. We also show how basic design choices affect the outcome.</br>
