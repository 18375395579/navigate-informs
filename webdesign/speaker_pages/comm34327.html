In order to eliminate errors organizations emphasize a learning-orientation, which refers to the importance given within the organization to increasing each employee's knowledge and competence. This study explored the concepts of learning-orientation, employee autonomy, and employee voice (employee's perception that speaking up in the organization is wise), and the interactions among them as predictors of resident physicians' medical errors.
