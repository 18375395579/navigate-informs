Title: Attacker-Defender Games with Partial Information About Defensive Allocations<br>Author: Nikhil Dighe, Research Assistant, University of Wisconsin, Madison, 1550 Engineering Drive, 3155 Engineering Centers Building, Madison, WI, 53713, United States, nsdighe@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vicki Bier<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We discuss the strategic interactions between a defender and an attacker, who partially observes the defender’s resource allocation (in particular, the number of resources defended).  In this model, keeping the defensive allocation secret is critical to achieving attacker deterrence cost-effectively.  This is a departure from the results of many previous models, in which disclosure of defensive resource allocations is advantageous to the defender.
