Title: Trading off between Resource Allocation to Prepare for and Recover from Disruptions<br>Author: Cameron MacKenzie, Assistant Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, United States of America, camacken@nps.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a model to help a decision maker allocate resources to prepare for a disruption and to help individual industries recover if the disruption occurs. The decision maker chooses these allocation amounts with the objective of minimizing the expected production losses from the disruption. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill serves as a real-world case study for this decision model. The model can be applied to different homeland security situations.
