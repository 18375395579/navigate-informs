<br>Title: Whose Side Are You On?  The Role of States In Influencing Healthcare Service Delivery Innovations</br><br>Author: Scott Feyereisen, 4666 East Camino Rosa, Tucson, AZ, 85718, United States of America, feyerbal@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Broschak</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We explore why all U.S. states would not adopt a seemingly rational, efficient and cost-reducing policy innovation.  Using institutional and resource dependence theory, we develop and test hypotheses related to a state’s propensity to adopt contested healthcare legislation.  Professional power and heterogeneity, state resources and prior state adoptions are hypothesized to affect a state’s likelihood of adopting a policy change.  We test our predictions using data on anesthesia policy adoptions.</br>
