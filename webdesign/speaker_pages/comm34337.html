Title: Hypergame Normal Form<br>Author: Russell R. Vane III, Senior Researcher, GDAIS, 1400 Key Boulevard, Arlington, VA, 22209, United States, russ.vane@gd-ais.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: An extension of original hypergame theory is presented in a normal form for recording competitive problem semantics.  These semantics include: possible situations and own options, surmised contexts of the other players, as well as our beliefs about evidence and expected outcomes.  The result is an effectiveness measure, Hypergame Expected Utility (HEU), for all own options over uncertainty.
