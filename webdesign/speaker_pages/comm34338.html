Title: Effects of Learning in Call Double Auctions with Uniform Pricing<br>Author: Mridul Pentapalli, Graduate Student, Iowa State University, 1207 Delaware Ave, Apt# 3, Ames, IA, 50014, United States, mridul@cs.iastate.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This study conducts computational experiments to compare reinforcement and neuro-evolution learning representations for traders participating in a call double auction with uniform pricing.  Two test cases are examined: a simple repeated auction; and an auction embedded within an empirically-based wholesale power market framework developed by Sun and Tesfatsion (2007).
