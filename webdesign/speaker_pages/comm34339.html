Title: Collaboration Matters: Evidence from the US-Japan Inventor Survey<br>Author: John Walsh, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, Public Policy, 685 Cherry St, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, john.walsh@pubpolicy.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sadao Nagaoka<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Using the US-Japan inventor surveys, we examine collaboration patterns across the two countries, and how the innovation process varies by industry and organization.  We find invention draws heavily on outside sources and is often a cooperative activity, much more than bibliometric data suggests. Furthermore, the degree of cooperation is broadly similar across the two countries. We also find, using the US data, that collaboration is associated with patent value and commercialization.
