Title: A Comparison of Scan and CUSUM Methods for Disease Surveillance with Poisson Data<br>Author: Kwok-Leung Tsui, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, ktsui@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yajun Mei, Sung Won Han<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Research on disease and public health surveillance has become very important. Scan and CUSUM methods are commonly used in public health surveillance for detecting an increase in disease occurrence.  In this talk we will discuss the design and relationships of the two charting methods.  We will compare their performance in terms of conditional expected delay (CED) under different change time and composite change size. Overall, the CUSUM method outperforms the scan method in many situations.
