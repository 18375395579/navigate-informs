Youn<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: To ensure safe and long-lasting protection of wood products, some chemicals have been used for wood protection.  Wood companies have tried to discriminate between woods treated and non-treated by a specific chemical.  We propose a new support vector-based wavelength selection algorithm for near infrared spectra data of wood products. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves computation time as well as classification accuracy.
