<br>Title: A New Support Vector Based Wavelength Selection Method for NIR Spectra of Wood Products</br><br>Author: Seung H. Baek, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, United States, sbaek4@utk.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Myong K. (MK) Jeong, Hyun W. Cho, Eun S. Youn</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: To ensure safe and long-lasting protection of wood products, some chemicals have been used for wood protection.  Wood companies have tried to discriminate between woods treated and non-treated by a specific chemical.  We propose a new support vector-based wavelength selection algorithm for near infrared spectra data of wood products. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves computation time as well as classification accuracy.</br>
