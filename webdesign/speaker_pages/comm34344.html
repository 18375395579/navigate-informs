We pay attention to the representation of technical change as it affects the marginal cost of abatement. We find how the firm’s investment is influenced by different technologies and uncertainties in the size and timing of a carbon tax. We find that the drivers of the optimal portfolio are the energy sources?elasticity of substitution and the efficacy of R&D into the energy types.</br>
