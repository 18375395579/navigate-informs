Title: Profit-maximizing Investments in Energy Technology under Carbon Tax Uncertainty<br>Author: Ekundayo Shittu, Research Assistant, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, eashittu@engin.umass.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We explore a firm’s profit-maximizing investment in an energy R&D portfolio in response to an uncertain carbon tax. We pay attention to the representation of technical change as it affects the marginal cost of abatement. We find how the firm’s investment is influenced by different technologies and uncertainties in the size and timing of a carbon tax. We find that the drivers of the optimal portfolio are the energy sources?elasticity of substitution and the efficacy of R&D into the energy types.
