If properly analyzed, this data can be a source of rich intelligence for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the tourist's choice is directly affected by the travel cost, which includes the financial cost and the time. In this paper, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation.</br>
