A summary of the approaches in the literatures is made to answer the following questions:  (1) what uncertainties does product development have to address?  (2) Which existing design methods address which type of the uncertainties?  (3) At what time of the product development process is each design for flexibility method effective?  Areas for further research are discussed.
