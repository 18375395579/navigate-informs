Smith School of Business, 3303 Van Munching Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742-1815, United States of America, mwedel@umd.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose an “Adaptive Personalization System?  The proposed system automatically downloads personalized play-lists of MP3 songs into a consumer’s mobile digital audio device and requires little proactive user effort.  The system works in real-time, and is scalable to the massive data typically encountered in personalization applications.  We implemented the Adaptive Personalization System on Palm PDA’s and tested its performance.      Tuck Siong Chung, Roland T. Rust and Michel Wedel
