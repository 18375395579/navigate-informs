The proposed system automatically downloads personalized play-lists of MP3 songs into a consumer’s mobile digital audio device and requires little proactive user effort.  The system works in real-time, and is scalable to the massive data typically encountered in personalization applications.  We implemented the Adaptive Personalization System on Palm PDA’s and tested its performance.      Tuck Siong Chung, Roland T. Rust and Michel Wedel</br>
