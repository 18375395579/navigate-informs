As novel product and process designs involve the large-scale integration of nano, micro and macro structures, the ability to position, manipulate and sense across multiple dimensional scales becomes extremely important. Technologies including nano positioning, advanced control, sensing and calibration are key factors to bridging the gap between emerging nano technologies and their manufacturing potential.</br>
