Title: The History and Significance of Corner Polyhedra<br>Author: Ralph Gomory, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and New York University, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, 630 Fifth Avenue, NYC, NY, 10111, United States of America, gomory@sloan.org<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The significance of Corner Polyhedra (CP) arises from the fact that all IP and mixed-IP problems are contained in the intersections of their CP. While these general problems can be extremely complex and unstructured, CP are highly structured and much can be learned about that structure. Thus, CP are a natural pathway for the development of a theory of IP and mixed-IP. They also can contribute to practical computations as an extremely rich source of a great variety of strong cutting planes.
