Title: Chapels in Bazaar? Latent Social Structure in Open Source Projects<br>Author: Premkumar Devanbu, UC Davis, 1672 Joshua Tree St, Davis, CA, United States of America, devanbu@cs.ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chris Bird<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Project managers organize teams carefully, mindful of skills, tasks, geography, etc.  Such constructed cathedrals contrast with the protean, chaotic ``bazaar  of open-source. Yet, in  the email social networks of the  better OSS projects, we find empirically that  social``cathedrals do emerge; we also find that these subgroups  manifest strongly in technical discussions, and are significantly connected with collaborative work.
