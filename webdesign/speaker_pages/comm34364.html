Whinston<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Most research done on keyword auctions is under monopoly settings.

We analyze the advertisers?equilibrium participation and bidding strategies and the auctioneers?strategies on the ranking rules, and eventually predict the market segmentation under the competition.
