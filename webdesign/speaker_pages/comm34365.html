<br>Title: Optimal Prevention and Detection of Invasive Species</br><br>Author: Robert Haight, Research Forester, USDA Forest Service, North Central Research Station, 1992 Folwell Avenue, St. Paul, MN, 55108, United States, rhaight@fs.fed.us</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shefali Mehta, Robert Venette</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Non-native invasive species cause substantial environmental and economic damage to forests.  Losses can be reduced by preventing arrival and rapidly detecting invasions.  We include prevention and detection activities in a renewal-reward process that accounts for uncertainty in pest arrival and detection.  The objective is to allocate resources among prevention and detection activities to minimize expected cost of damages.  Results are presented for oak wilt management in the Minnesota.</br>
