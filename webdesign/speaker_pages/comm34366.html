<br>Title: An Equilibrium Model of Online Shopping Supply Chain Networks with Service Capacity Investment</br><br>Author: Patrick Qiang, Penn State University, 30 E. Swedesford Rd, Malvern, PA, 19355, United States of America, qzq10@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yihong Hu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose an online shopping supply chain network model including manufacturers, e-tailers, express service providers, and consumers. Consumers purchase products from e-tailers which can be delivered either by the express service companies or can be picked up by customers depending on the consumer’s preference on time and cost. The express service companies can also invest to improve their service quality. Theoretical results are presented and numerical examples are provided for illustration.</br>
