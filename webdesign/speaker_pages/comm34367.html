Title: A Two-stage Stochastic Program for Coordination of Disaster Relief Organizations<br>Author: Luis de la Torre, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, Technological Institute C236, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States of America, ledelatorre@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karen Smilowitz, Irina Dolinskaya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Studies of humanitarian operations have found that coordination between relief organizations is challenging to execute but critical for effective assistance. We present a stochastic program for distribution of goods with uncertainty in the accessibility of demand locations. Collaborations are formed in the first stage and multi-day operational decisions are made in the second stage. We discuss insights on the benefits to effective distribution under various limited types of collaboration.
