Title: Experimental Comparison of Current Integer-programming Solvers<br>Author: Cynthia Phillips, Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 1318, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States, caphill@sandia.gov<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We compare the performance of commercial and open-source/free integer programming codes on MIPLIB instances and other challenging problems.  Other talks in this session focus on specific parts of the search process.  In this talk we consider the total time to find a solution.  We hope to enlist the participation of a developer from each IP code in this study.
