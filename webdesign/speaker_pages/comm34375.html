Title: Advanced Demand Forecasting Algorithm<br>Author: Yanfang Shen, Chief OR Analyst, Clearsight Systems, 12828 Northup Way, Suite 310, Bellevue, WA, 98005, United States, yanfang.shen@clearsightsystems.com<br>Coauthor(s): Vladimir Brayman, Wolf Kohn<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed algorithm for the real-time estimation of product demand as a function of sensory data (RFID, Bar code readers). The algorithm includes building a sub-process that learns the parameters of the model, and scheduling their incorporation as a function of observed behavior quality of the forecast. We will describe the algorithm and theoretical aspects of the technology. We will illustrate the technology with an example.
