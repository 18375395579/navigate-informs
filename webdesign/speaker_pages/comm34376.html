<br>Title: Design Issues for Combinatorial Clock Auctions</br><br>Author: Lawrence Ausubel, Professor, University of Maryland, Department of Economics, Tydings Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, ausubel@econ.umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The combinatorial clock auction (CCA) is a recent innovation in market design. It has been adopted for spectrum auctions in the UK, Denmark, Netherlands, Ireland, Canada and Australia. This paper explores some critical design issues. It considers features intended to limit strategic manipulation. It shows deficiencies in points-based activity rules and advantages in revealed-preference rules. It assesses implementation issues involving reserve prices and with large numbers of regional licenses.</br>
