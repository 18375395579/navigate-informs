Title: On-site Renewable Generation: Portfolio Selection and Contracts under Uncertainty<br>Author: Diego Klabjan, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, IEMS, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, d-klabjan@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sangho Shim, Jorge Arinez, Stephan Biller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Investment decisions about on-site renewable generation for industrial sites are driven by net present value which inhibits many uncertainties. We present an optimization model for portfolio selection and an options contract. The uncertainties are driven by prices of renewable energy credits, on-site usage and output of sources, and future grid rates.
