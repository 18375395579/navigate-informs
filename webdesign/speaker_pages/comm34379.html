In this country, the residential sector faces a fixed pricing scheme. It does not include the increased cost of the system produced by the high variability of the load curve characteristic. We have simulated the effects it could have on the beneficial of DISCOs a new TOU system for electricity consumption in Chile, obtaining a win-win situation among DISCOs and consumers.
