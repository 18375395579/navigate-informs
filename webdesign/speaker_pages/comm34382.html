<br>Title: Intensity-Based Models of the Credit Value Adjustment: Capturing Wrong Way  Risk</br><br>Author: Samim Ghamami, University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, samim_ghamami@berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Hull and White (2013) model wrong way risk in Credit Value Adjustment calculations by expressing the counterparty's default intensity in terms of the financial institution's credit exposure. We derive a formula for CVA for a similar class of intensity models; we show that wrong way risk does not affect the credit quality of the counterparty. Our numerical examples demonstrate that independent CVA can exceed wrong way CVA.</br>
