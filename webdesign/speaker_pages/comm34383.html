Title: Network Inference for Monitoring Cyber-physical Systems (CPS)<br>Author: Alla Kammerdiner, Assistant Professor, New Mexico State University, PO Box 30001, MSC 4230, Las Cruces, NM, 88003, United States of America, alla@nmsu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: CPS emergence in power grid, healthcare, and manufacturing poses new challenges in systems engineering. Safety, privacy, and security require CPS monitoring to prevent blackouts and disruptions, exposure of private data, loss of strategic advantage. Standard security monitoring comes short. Big Data in CPS operations requires new network science, to allow sensitivity and scalability. We propose methodology for monitoring security of cyber-physical systems and illustrate numerically.
