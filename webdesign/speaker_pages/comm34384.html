Get it wrong and an organisation can be faced with massive losses. Get it wrong, and valuable commercial and development opportunities will be lost. Understanding the dynamics of risk in service systems is critical.  We will discuss how this problem can be approached, and illustrate our approach through the use of examples from public and private service systems.</br>
