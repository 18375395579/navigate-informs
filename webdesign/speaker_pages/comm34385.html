<br>Title: Neurophysiological Methods in Decision Making Research</br><br>Author: Niklas Ravaja, Professor, Aalto University, School of Economics, P.O. Box 21255, Helsinki, 00076, Finland, ravaja@mappi.helsinki.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pekka Korhonen, Outi Somervuori, Jyrki Wallenius, Murat Koksalan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Neurophysiological or psychophysiological measures, such as electroencephalography (EEG), facial electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electrodermal activity (EDA), have attained increasing attention in studying emotional and cognitive processes during decision making. This presentation will discuss the use of these measures. In addition, some recent decision making studies employing neurophysiological measures will be presented.</br>
