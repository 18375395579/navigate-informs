Title: Project Management under Uncertainty - How (and When) to Encourage Help<br>Author: Fabian Sting, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands, fsting@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Yaozhong Wu, Pascale Crama<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Inspired by a real-life NPD organization, we present a model of a project management system that incorporates cooperative behavior. Core element of the system is that project managers may mutually ask for and provide help. We study the system’s performance in various environments. A natural order of projects emerges, even with symmetrical projects: the firm induces different effort levels for projects. This order also explains the value of help under correlated uncertainties between projects.
