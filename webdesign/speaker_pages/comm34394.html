Title: The Design Challenges of Experiential Services<br>Author: Yannis Bellos, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree St. NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, Ioannis.Bellos@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stylianos Kavadias<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper we explore the design challenges of an organization that develops an experiential service. Building on the customer journey concept, which maps an experiential service to customer-provider interaction touchpoints, we analyze the service provider's design decisions: the touchpoints she controls, and the price she charges. We fully characterize the conditions under which the provider can use her design decisions to successfully signal service quality.
