Title: Evaluation of Hydropower Upgrade Projects under Uncertainty<br>Author: Ane Marte Heggedal, PhD-student, Norwegian U of Sci and Tech, Dept Industrial Economics and Tech Mgm, Trondheim, MI, 7050, Norway, ane.m.heggedal@iot.ntnu.no<br>Coauthor(s): Stein-Erik Fleten, Morten Elverhøi, Ole Christian Troland<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Upgrading of hydro power stations rise questions regarding what technology, size and location of the power station to choose when the investment is taken under uncertainty. The option of rehabilitating existing facilities does not exclude the option to invest in new facilities while the option to build a new power plant excludes the option to rehabilitate. By performing a real option analysis we hope to find the optimal solution of when to invest, and which investment alternative to undertake.
