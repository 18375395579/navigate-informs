Title: A Real Options Approach to Optimizing Investment in Low-carbon Energy Technology Development<br>Author: Emily Fertig, Postdoctoral Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Building E40-227, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, efertig@mit.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Uncertainty in technological learning is crucial to planning technology development strategies. This paper develops a real options-based stochastic dynamic programming method for optimizing investment in low-carbon energy technology development under uncertainty in the effectiveness of both early-stage R and D and learning-by-doing (LBD). Results indicate that imminent deployment, high cost, lower exogenous cost reductions, and lower program funds all promote R and D spending over LBD.
