Ro<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The widely accepted notion that incumbent firms falter in the market when dealing with architectural innovation begs the question of whether they can successfully introduce architectural innovations in a mature industry.  We investigate the U.S bicycle drive train component industries via in-depth case analyses.  This study highlights the importance of an incumbent’s prior innovation experience, new product architecture knowledge, and hierarchy mode for successful architectural innovation.
