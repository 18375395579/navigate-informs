Title: Irreversible Treatment Decisions under the Possibility of Improved Treatment Discoveries<br>Author: Steven Shechter, Assistant Professor, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, steven.shechter@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Roberts, Oguzhan Alagoz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a patient with a degenerative disease who may take some currently available treatment which extends life but has significant consequences for quality of life (e.g., mastectomy).  Moreover, the treatment is irreversible so that should a better treatment become available, the patient could no longer take advantage of it.  We present an MDP that explicitly considers new treatment discovery in this context and how it may affect decisions regarding the available irreversible treatment.
