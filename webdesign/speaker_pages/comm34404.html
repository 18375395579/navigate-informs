Title: You Get What You Give, or Do You? A Comparison of Resource Sharing among Entrepreneurs<br>Author: Mabel Abraham, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, mlba@mit.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: It is established that network benefits are greater for men than for women. Extant research has attributed this gender difference in benefits to network structure, arguing that men and women are embedded in different networks. This focus provides a limited explanation as the benefits of social ties are contingent on an actor’s ability to mobilize resources. I address this gap using a unique research setting to compare the returns to social capital for men and women embedded in the same networks.
