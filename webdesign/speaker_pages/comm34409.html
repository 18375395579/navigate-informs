Title: Adaptive Web Presence and Evolution Through Web Usage Mining<br>Author: Xueping Li, Assistant Professor, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Xueping.Li@utk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laigang Song<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper considers establishing adaptive web presence and evolution through web mining. It presents a workload characterization study for Internet web servers. Several workload invariants are identified which are deemed important since they potentially reveal the universal truth for all web servers. These regularities and patterns shed light on how to design a better Web and enhance its performance.
