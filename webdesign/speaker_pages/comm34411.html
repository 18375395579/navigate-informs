These include mass vaccination, anti-viral distribution, and social distancing policies such as school and work closures, quarantine, and isolation. Using BioWar, a multi-agent, city-scale model that incorporates social networks, we designed an influenza epidemic simulation and virtual experiments to test the efficacy and impact of these potential strategies.</br>
