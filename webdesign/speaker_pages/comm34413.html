An event study is conducted on a sample of 52 firms with material weaknesses in their internal IT controls.  Negative abnormal returns are evident around (0,+1) 2005 10K filings with adverse disclosures.  A value reduction occurs when the 2006 10K is filed with remediating and unremediating firms suffering negative abnormal returns.
