<br>Title: The New Energy Model Design on Oil Sand Production and Export</br><br>Author: Cheng-Marshal Wang, Environment Canada, 10 Wellington Street, 25th Floor, Gatineau, QC, K1A0H3, Canada, Cheng-Marshal.Wang@ec.gc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nick Macaluso</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: International energy trading is of vital importance to Canada’s continued economic growth. The uncertainty on Keystone XL and Gateway pipelines will affect the projection of Canadian oil sand export and production. We will develop a two-stage Stochastic Programming EC-IAM (Integrated Assessment Model) to explore the implications of energy productions and export. The Hoteling framework on modeling depletable resources will be reviewed and refined to better project Oil Sand production.</br>
