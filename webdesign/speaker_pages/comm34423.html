Cyber risk management is further complicated by the need to trade off the security enhancing features of network defenses and corresponding loses of capabilities that may accompany them. This presentation examines the use of multiple objective decision analysis to measure both the attractiveness of attacks to adversaries and the trade-offs required for striking the proper balance between security and functionality.
