Title: Traffic Engineering vs. Source Routing: Inefficiency and Paradoxes<br>Author: Ramesh Johari, Assistant Professor, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Center 319, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, rjohari@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Asuman Ozdaglar, Daron Acemoglu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Most large-scale communication networks, such as the Internet, consist of interconnected administrative domains.  In this talk we will study the interaction between source (or selfish) routing across domains, and intradomain optimization by service providers.  We will discuss the efficiency of the resulting outcome, as well as some paradoxes that can result from the interaction of traffic engineering and source routing.
