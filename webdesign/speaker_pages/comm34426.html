Title: The Value of Software Architecture<br>Author: Clay Williams, Manager, Governance Science Research, IBM, IBM Research, Hawthorne, NY, 10532, United States of America, clayw@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Software architecture has moved beyond addressing purely computational concerns, as academics in both computer science and business have explored how architectures can create value for a firm.  In this talk, I will review some of the fundamental work exploring the economics of software architecture.  I will then present a framework where architecture is central to the questions of value and governance in software development.  I conclude by discussing some open research questions.
