Title: Stochastic Modeling and Optimization for Clinical Research Integration and Longitudinal Coordination<br>Author: Jivan Deglise-Hawkinson, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, jivan@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Van Oyen, Blake Roessler<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The complex resource and time coordination needs of clinical research treatments require forecasting and optimization to extract the highest scientific value about the disease while having a practice performing at the desired service levels for patients and work conditions for nurses. We propose a Capacity Planning Tool and Informatics System that optimizes the proposed clinical research portfolio to perform and the Booking strategy for the chosen portfolio.
