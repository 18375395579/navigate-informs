Hospitals are facing rising demands that have led to increased waiting time for patient admission and other inpatient processes. A study at the VA Hospital in Tampa is being conducted with the aim of reducing the waiting time and process delays. Improved information and patient flows between departments would help to decrease the length of stay of patients.
