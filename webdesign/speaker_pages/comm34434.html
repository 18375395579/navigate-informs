Before this tournament begins, sports fans and neophytes attempt to predict a “perfect bracket?that correctly forecasts the winners of all tournament games, and submit their predictions to competitions (e.g., office pools, Internet-wide competitions).

Beginning in 2011, this model was adapted into a web-based tool, allowing users to assess prospective brackets online and leading to significant popular and media attention.</br>
