Having walked the path from theoretical idea to trading platform, we illustrate the hard process of trading strategy creation. The end result - a platform that generates signals and executes trades - could be a product of art and science. We identify practical questions and attempt answers. We present the general framework, and the individual steps to creating a strategy.</br>
