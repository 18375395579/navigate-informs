Title: Expected Interference and Concurrent Transmission in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks<br>Author: Shivkumar Kalyanaraman, Professor, shivkuma@ecse.rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lili Du, Satish Ukkusuri<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk will address the issue of interference caused by  concurrent transmissions in a vehicular ad hoc network. Specifically,  we will discuss analytical expressions of expected interference due to  vehicular mobility and driver behavior. In addition an integer  programming model to determine concurrent transmissions will be  discussed. Finally, the implications on network throughput and open  research questions in this area will be highlighted.
