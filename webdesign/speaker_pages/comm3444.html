Specifically,  we will discuss analytical expressions of expected interference due to  vehicular mobility and driver behavior. In addition an integer  programming model to determine concurrent transmissions will be  discussed. Finally, the implications on network throughput and open  research questions in this area will be highlighted.</br>
