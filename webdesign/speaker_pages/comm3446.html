<br>Title: Bidirectional Utility Diagrams</br><br>Author: Ali Abbas, Assistant Professor, College of Engineering, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61822, United States, aliabbas@uiuc.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a graphical representation of multiattribute utility functions that captures the asymmetric nature of utility dependence. This representation facilitates the elicitation of multiattribute utility functions and enables their decomposition into lower order terms that are easier to elicit by knowledge of utility independence relations among the attributes.</br>
