<br>Title: Structural Analysis and its Application to Multi-unit Sequential Dutch Auctions</br><br>Author: Yixin Lu, PhD Candidate, Erasmus University, Rotterdam School of Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands, ylu@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eric van Heck, Alok Gupta, Wolf Ketter</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a structural model for multi-unit sequential Dutch auctions where multiple units of identical products are auctioned in sequential rounds. Using the real-world transaction data from a complex Business-to-Business (B2B) auction market, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in characterizing the dynamics of winning bids.</br>
