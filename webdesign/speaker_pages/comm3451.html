Title: Multi-Criteria Optimization Models for Supply Risk Management<br>Author: Tao Yang, Graduate Student, Industrial Engineering, Penn State University, 176 Larkspur Lane, State College, PA, 16803, United States, tuy100@psu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Although the importance of risk management in supply chain is widely recognized, the research and application are quite limited due to the lack of quantitative tools. Risks can bring significant impacts to buyers. However, risk management cost money, time, etc. Therefore, tradeoffs have to be made. This paper introduces a method to quantify supply risks at first. Then, two multi-criteria optimization models for supply risk management at strategic and operational levels are proposed.
