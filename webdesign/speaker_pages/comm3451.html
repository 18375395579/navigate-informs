Risks can bring significant impacts to buyers. However, risk management cost money, time, etc. Therefore, tradeoffs have to be made. This paper introduces a method to quantify supply risks at first. Then, two multi-criteria optimization models for supply risk management at strategic and operational levels are proposed.</br>
