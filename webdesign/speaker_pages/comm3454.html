Title: Comparing MILP Heuristics: Implementations and Analysis<br>Author: Jean-Paul Watson, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 5800, MS 1318, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1318, United States, jwatson@sandia.gov<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Heuristics for incumbent generation and improvement are a crucial performance component of commercial and open-source MIP solvers. We contrast the various algorithms available in these MIP solvers. We focus - to the extent possible given available information - on specific implementation decisions and architecture within the branch-and-bound/cut framework. The incumbent-finding and improvement capabilities of several solvers is then contrasted on a range of difficult MIP benchmarks.
