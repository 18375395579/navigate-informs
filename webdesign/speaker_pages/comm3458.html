<br>Title: The Topology of Central Counterparty Clearing Networks and Network Stability</br><br>Author: Richard Sowers, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States of America, r-sowers@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rui Song, Jonathan Jones</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a simple model of a trading network with central counterparties and Gaussian exposures.  We are interested in the structure of rare events (Maximum Exposure at Risk).  We identify a large-deviations-type result which captures some of the structure of rare events.</br>
