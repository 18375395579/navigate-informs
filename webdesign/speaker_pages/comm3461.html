Title: Disentangling Price Impact from Alpha<br>Author: Mehmet Saglam, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, MSaglam13@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ciamac Moallemi, Michael Sotiropoulos<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by the performance measurement literature in active portfolio management, we are interested in attributing the price changes observed during an execution of a large trade between the client's short term predictive ability, alpha view, and the broker's price impact. Using execution data with a large universe of clients, we show that incorporating client’s alpha view drastically increases the explanatory power of existing models and enables to accurately estimate the price impact.
