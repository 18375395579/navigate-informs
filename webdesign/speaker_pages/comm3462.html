<br>Title: The Optimization Problem for a SmartGrid Aggregator with Multiple Markets for Flexibility</br><br>Author: Stig Ottesen, PhD Candidate, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Alfred getz vei 3, Trondheim, 7491, Norway, stig.ottesen@ncesmart.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Asgeir Tomasgard</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: More dynamics in the power systems lead to an increasing need for operational flexibility. Traditionally only generators and large consumers have access to markets where flexibility is valued. A SmartGrid aggregator may open such markets also for demand side participation. This paper describes the aggregator role and its possible business opportunities in current market regime.  A mathematical formulation of the aggregator’s optimization problem is given covering different time horizons.</br>
