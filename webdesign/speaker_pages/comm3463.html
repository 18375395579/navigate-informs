Title: Scaling up HIV Treatment in Resource Constrained Settings<br>Author: Sarang Deo, Kellogg School of Management, 596 Leverone, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, s-deo@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Charles Corbett<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: HIV clinics operating in developing countries have to contend with an uncertain supply of drugs. This creates a trade-off between enrolling new patients and providing uninterrupted treatment to those already enrolled. We formalize this trade-off using stochastic dynamic program, derive the optimal policy for the number of new enrollments and compare its performance with that of policies used in practice. We discuss the relevance of our model to the resource allocation decision in non-profits.
