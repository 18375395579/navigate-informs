<br>Title: Stochastic Challenge: Computational Tools from Inference to Prediction</br><br>Author: Ivan Guardiola, Assistant professor, Missouri S&T, 600 W. 14th Street, Rolla, MO, 65401, United States of America, guardiolai@mst.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This presentation highlights the online calculators developed as part of an NSF-TUES sponsored educational grant. These calculators allow for online execution without the need of coding or software downloading and installation. The calculators include computations common to stochastic processes course or probabilistic modeling courses. The calculators include topics such as discrete time markov chains, continuous time markov chains, statistical testing.</br>
