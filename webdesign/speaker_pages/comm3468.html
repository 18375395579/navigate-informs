Title: Paying for the Smart Grid<br>Author: Luciano De Castro, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, l-decastro@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joisa Dutra<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Smart grid (SG) technologies may bring substantial advantages to the society, but the required investments are also sizable. This paper establishes a framework for examining the issues related to the SG, and highlights some of the difficulties in funding SG investments. In particular, we show that generators will lose profits as a direct effect of demand response initiatives, and most of the benefits of SG cannot be easily converted into payments.
