Researchers are confronted with the need to define the concept of knowledge, and to offer metrics of its outputs, benefits and value to organizations. This paper traces the evolution of knowledge management through the mapping of its key concepts and its main problems. Knowledge management has developed as a field of study independent of information systems, but it is still facing fundamental challenges such as the definition of its unit of analysis. This paper offers a coherent model of evolution of knowledge management which delineates its stages of development, the problems it faces, and some solutions offered by its researchers.</br>
