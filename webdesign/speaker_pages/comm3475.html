Here supply and demand are expressed in drastically greater detail than in traditional electronic auctions, and are algorithmically cleared.  This creates a Pareto efficiency improvement in the allocation (aka win-win).  I will share our experiences from CombineNet, Inc. of hosting over $40 billion of such transactions over the last eight years in the domain of strategic sourcing, yielding over $5 billion in savings.  I will tie in very recent pertinent game theory on a few of the topics.  For example, any form of added expressiveness can only increase efficiency.  Topics include:  -Natural bidding languages that made combinatorial auctions practical here.  -The ways by which expressive bidding increases efficiency.  -Scalability of state-of-the-art winner determination algorithms.  -Expressiveness by the bid taker, and associated scenario navigation capabilities.  These enable the bid taker to make the allocation implementable, express preferences, help internal stakeholder alignment, and obtain a quantitative understanding of the tradeoffs available in the supply chain.  -How we use winner determination to automatically (re-)engineer the entire (multi-level) supply chain.  -How we use winner determination to automatically configure the items to be sourced. -How incumbency and other special considerations can/should be treated.</br>
