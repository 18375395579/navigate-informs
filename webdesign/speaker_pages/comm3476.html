Title: Mechanisms of Effective Error Detection in Product Development<br>Author: Phil Gouel, University of Michigan, pgouel@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sebastian Fixson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The development of complex products is a multi-year process involving thousands of engineers. Most established organizations have elaborated systems to detect and correct errors. Using a detailed study in the automotive setting in this paper we investigate empirically the effectiveness of various error detection mechanisms. We provide managerial guidelines for structuring error detection systems.
