Depression care is guided by a collaborative team care protocol. In one study arm, 500 patients also receive automatic telephonic depression symptom assessment over time and their providers automatically tasked per protocol. At 6 months, patients in the technology arm have significantly lower PHQ-9 depression scores and are less likely to have major depression.
