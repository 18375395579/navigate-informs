<br>Title: The Butterfly Effect: Systemic and Behavioral Risks in Distributed Innovation</br><br>Author: Nitin Joglekar, Associate Professor, Boston University, 525 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States, joglekar@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Anderson</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We explore distributed innovation decisions from systems thinking perspective. This approach enables us to link the architectural, behavioral, competitive, and demand risks though feedback mechanisms. We argue that decisions underlying such innovation structures are susceptible to the butterfly effect: path dependent amplification of small uncertainties due to feedback and dynamic complexity can lead unintended consequences such as turf building and tipping the balance within a firm’s portfolio.</br>
