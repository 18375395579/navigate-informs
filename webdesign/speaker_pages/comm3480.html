Title: Optimal Return Policies and Information Provision<br>Author: Jeff Shulman, Assistant Professor, University of Washington Business School, 252 MacKenzie Hall Box 353200, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, jshulman@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Canan Savaskan, Anne Coughlan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper, we merge research streams from marketing and operations by developing an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a firm’s pricing and restocking fee decisions. We identify the value to the firm of investing in marketing efforts to inform consumers of the best purchase decision in order to eliminate returns. Surprisingly, we find that informing consumers of product fit is not always optimal, even if it were free to do so.
