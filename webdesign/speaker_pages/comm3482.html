Title: Innovation Contests and Multi-agent Problem Solving<br>Author: Yi Xu, Assistant Professor, University of Miami, 412B Jenkins Bldg., 5250 University Dr., Coral Gables, FL, 33146, United States, yxu@exchange.sba.miami.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In an innovation contest, a firm (the seeker) facing an innovation related problem posts this problem to a population of independent agents (the solvers) and then provides an award to the agent that has generated the best solution. In this paper, we find that the seeker can benefit from a larger solver population as he obtains a more diverse set of solutions.
