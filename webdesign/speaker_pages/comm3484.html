<br>Title: The Sum of Our Fears and Egocentric Zero-sum Assumptions</br><br>Author: Richard John, Associate Professor, University of Southern California, Dept of Psychology mc-1061, CREATE, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-1061, United States of America, richardj@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Heather Rosoff</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Terrorist strategic decision making for selecting among targets and attack modes depends on terrorist beliefs, objectives, and values.  A zero-sum assumption implies that terrorist values are in perfect, direct opposition to our own and demonstrates a flawed egocentric bias.  Through use of value focused thinking and decision analytic modeling, we illustrate pitfalls in the zero-sum assumption that may result in an unwarranted emphasis on terrorist scenarios representing our greatest fears.</br>
