<br>Title: Real Options</br><br>Author: Gill Eapen, Founder and Managing Principal, Decision Options, LLC, 94 Anchorage Circle, Groton, CT, 06340, United States of America, geapen@decisionoptions.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Traditional finance based on Capital Asset Pricing Model and Discounted Cash Flow analysis does not work well in situations that present a high level of uncertainty and decision flexibility. In such cases, a more holistic approach, decision options analysis incorporates embedded option like characteristics in decisions. Although this approach has been well researched there are still many misconceptions in practice. This paper illustrates why such misconceptions exist and how to overcome them.</br>
