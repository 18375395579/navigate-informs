<br>Title: Designing a Pareto Improving Residential Electricity Rate Structure under Regulation</br><br>Author: Seth Borin, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, sborin3@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Valerie Thomas</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the effects on consumer behavior and utility profits of residential electricity rate structures under regulation, in a case study of the state of Georgia.  We seek to design a long-run Pareto improving rate structure in which all parties are left no worse off than under the current rate structure.  The resulting consumption levels, utility profits, greenhouse gas emissions, and impact on the net present value of energy efficiency investments are analyzed.</br>
