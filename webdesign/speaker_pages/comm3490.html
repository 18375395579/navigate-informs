<br>Title: Emergent Innovation ?Towards as New Paradigm for Innovation Research and Management</br><br>Author: Erik Lindhult, Mälardalen University, Box 325, Eskilstuna, SE 63105, Sweden, erik.lindhult@mdh.se</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Emergent innovation describes value creation as something that can emerge everywhere, and wherein anyone can become an innovator. It assumes that innovation can only partly be formalized in processes, concentrated in specific units, and performed in a planned fashion by innovation experts. This paper argues that the ways in which human interaction dynamics generate emergent innovative structures can be clarified using complex systems models that include nonlinear interactions and processes.</br>
