Title: Routing and Allocation in Stochastic Swap Container Management<br>Author: Thomas Huth, Research Associate, University Braunschweig Institute of Technology, Abt-Jerusalem-Str. 4, Braunschweig, 38106, Germany, t.huth@tu-bs.de<br>Coauthor(s): Dirk Mattfeld<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The routing of customer requests with reusable resources is mostly associated with decisions about repositioning of these resources empties?because of spatial and temporal unfitted streams of commodities. If customer requests appear stochastically this allocation task becomes more challenging. This talk addresses strategies to incorporate stochastic information about demanded resources in order to support the routing decision that may lead to a benefit for the entire Problem.
