Title: On the Inadequacy of Var-based Risk Management: VaR, CVaR, and Nonlinear Interactions<br>Author: Uma Ravat, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Department of Mathematics, Urbana, IL, United States of America, ravat1@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag, Richard Sowers<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine the role of  VaR-constraints in managing financial risk accumulated by risk-seeking traders. This risk can be either finite or unbounded depending on the asset distributions. In either instance,  VaR thresholds are seen to be inadequate in guarding against ?nancial ruin.
