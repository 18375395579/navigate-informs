<br>Title: Multi-modal, Behavior-robust, Adaptive Evacuation Management</br><br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E 2nd St. Room 206, Department of Civil Eng.and Eng. Mech., Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, chiu@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hickman, Pitu Mirchandani</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: During emergencies requiring evacuation, traveler behavior may deviate significantly from model-predicted outputs. This applies in a multi-modal context, affecting both automobile route choice and the mobility needs of “carless?populations. Such uncertainty on traveler behavior underscores the need for behavior-robust, adaptive transportation management strategies during an evacuation. The implications for both evacuees and emergency operations and logistics managers are discussed.</br>
