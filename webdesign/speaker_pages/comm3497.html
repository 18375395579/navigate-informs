Title: Interconnected Balance Sheets, Market Liquidity, and Amplification Effects in a Financial System<br>Author: Nan Chen, Associate Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 709A William Mong Engineering Building, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): David Yao, Xin Liu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper investigates the amplification effect of a financial system to develop individual defaults to a systemic catastrophe. We develop a network-based approach to characterize how the topological structures of the system and asset liquidation interact with each other to amplify the systemic risk. We propose two multipliers, network multiplier and liquidity multiplier, to characterize the above amplification effects.
