Title: Hydrocarbon Resource Allocation Strategy for Industry Development in an Energy-rich Nation<br>Author: Mazen Skaf, Partner & Managing Director, Strategic Decisions Group, 745 Emerson St, Palo Alto, CA, 94301, United States of America, MSkaf@sdg.com<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Seyller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a DA-based process and system for optimizing the allocation of supplies of a hydrocarbon resource across proposed industrial projects taking into account: i) uncertainty in future supply and demand,  ii) various economic, social, and environmental value measures, and iii) existing commitments for current domestic uses and industries.  The value-focused approach resulted in a paradigm shift in the industrial development strategy as well as in the future focus of E&P activities.
