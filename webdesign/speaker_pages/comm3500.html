Cross-training can increase knowledge sharing, for example by enabling better communication between employees. On the other hand, cross-training increases the functional similarity between employees, which in turn can increase the competition between them, thereby reducing knowledge sharing behavior. We explore these relationships empirically using survey data from three different companies.
