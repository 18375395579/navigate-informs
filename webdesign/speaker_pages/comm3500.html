<br>Title: Cross-Training, Social Identity and Knowledge Sharing</br><br>Author: Enno Siemsen, Assistant Professor of Business Administration, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Business Administration, 350 Wohlers Hall, 1206 S. Sixth Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States, siemsen@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sridhar Balasubramanian, Aleda Roth</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This research explores the relationship between cross-training and inter-employee knowledge sharing. Cross-training can increase knowledge sharing, for example by enabling better communication between employees. On the other hand, cross-training increases the functional similarity between employees, which in turn can increase the competition between them, thereby reducing knowledge sharing behavior. We explore these relationships empirically using survey data from three different companies.</br>
