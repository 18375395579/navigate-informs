Sixth Street, 350 Wohlers Hall, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, atafti@illinois.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The production of information technology products and services involves a highly elaborate ecosystem of customers, collaborators, and competitors. In this study, I use a set of predictive statistical techniques to explore the determinants of positioning in an extended network alliances among IT-producing firms, as a means to develop more useful theories about how such IT ecosystems evolve.
