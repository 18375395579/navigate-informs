For each of 36 service operations scores were assessed for 6 service dimensions and 8 risk factors. Statistical clustering methods were applied, and dimension reduction was used to refine the clustering. The results indicate connections between the service operations, service dimensions, and risk factors. Initial findings and a plan for follow-up work will be discussed.</br>
