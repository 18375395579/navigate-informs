Title: A Dynamic Model of Knowledge Creation from Exploration and Exploitation in the High-tech Venture<br>Author: Jennifer Bailey, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 W. Peachtree Road, NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, Jennifer.Bailey@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cheryl Gaimon<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a dynamic model of exploration and exploitation for a high-tech venture. The uncertain nature of these learning activities is captured in terms of the mean and variance of the innovation outcomes.  We consider the impact of the venture’s absorptive capacity as well as the lagged effect of exploration on innovation outcomes. We determine when the typical explore-exploit versus an atypical exploit-explore sequential strategy is optimal.
