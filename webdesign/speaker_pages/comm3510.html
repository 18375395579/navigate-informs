Title: Information Mechanisms<br>Author: Paul J. Healy, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, phealy@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Lowery, John Ledyard<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Markets are just one way to elicit predictions and to aggregate information from groups. Other mechanisms include pari-mutuel processes, voting, scoring rules, polls, etc.  We examine the performance of many mechanisms in both simple and moderately complex environments.  We find that markets and pari-mutuel mechanisms perform less well than usually advertised. Suitably designed polls and market scoring rules perform better - yielding more accurate and faster information aggregation.
