Title: Satisfying Multiple Objectives in Infrastructure Management Planning<br>Author: Hana Chmielewski, North Carolina State University, Campus Box 7908, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, htchmiel@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ranji Ranjithan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms lend themselves to solving cross-disciplinary problems with multiple objectives. In infrastructure planning, for example, it may be useful to consider the resource and performance objectives of engineers, land-use planners, and emergency managers. An algorithm that offers maximally different non-inferior management plans by preserving the diversity of solutions in the decision space is applied to aid decision-making in waste water treatment planning.
