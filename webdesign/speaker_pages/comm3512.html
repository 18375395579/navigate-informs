<br>Title: Service Engineering ?Trends, Perspectives and the contribution to Service Science</br><br>Author: Walter Ganz, Director, Fraunhofer IAO, Nobelstr. 12, Stuttgart, 70569, Germany, Walter.Ganz@iao.fraunhofer.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Meiren</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in relation to the definitions, typologies of services. It is noticeable that the development of fundamental models for services has tended to be neglected. Discussing the options of model creation as well as the simulation of services was a central topic of our expert study “MARS? It becomes obvious that the creation of models as well as simulation has gained an importance within the last years and it could make a relevant contribution for Service Science</br>
