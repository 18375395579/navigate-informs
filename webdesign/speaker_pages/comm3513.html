This paper presents a general Data Mining-Based Decision System (DMBDS) framework to mimic current dispatch processes and generate solutions for LPDPs by learning from historical data. An application in the intermodal freight industry is tested, where the DMBDS provides good solutions which are comparable to the real solutions provided by expert dispatchers, with respect to a set of key performance indicators.
