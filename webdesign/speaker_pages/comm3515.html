In 2011 the medical tourism market was an estimated $20 billion, up from under $2 billion in 2005.  The combination of cheap price and good medical care has caused an increasing number of Americans to choose medical tourism. We develop a mathematical model illustrated through discrete event simulation to show the impact of medical tourism on the cost and effectiveness of US healthcare delivery system.</br>
