Title: Stochastic Model of International Fuel Procurement for Coal-fired Plants in Hydrothermal Systems<br>Author: Fernanda Thom? Research Engineer, PSR, Praia de Botafogo 228 / 1701-A, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22250145, Brazil, fernanda@psr-inc.com<br>Coauthor(s): Andr?Dias, Silvio Binato, Eduardo Faria<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This work presents an optimal strategy for international fuel procurement, transportation and storage in order to ensure continuous supply of coal-fired thermal plants. A stochastic programming problem takes into account the uncertainty associated with inflows in a hydrothermal system and other complex logistical and commercial aspects related to imported coal handling. The model results are shown by comparisons between different strategies when applied to different dispatch scenarios.
