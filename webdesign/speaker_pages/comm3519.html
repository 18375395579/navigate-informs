Title: Using Proximity to Speed Up Experts Algorithms in Reactive Environments<br>Author: Daniela Pucci de Farias, pucci@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeremy Schwartz<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Experts algorithms use a fixed set of strategies to make decisions sequentially in unknown environments. In reactive environments, the method matches the performance of the best expert, but bounds on convergence rate suggest a severe dependence on number of experts. We explore proximity metrics among experts to speed up convergence. A simple scheme is shown to asymptotically perform as well as the best expert. Empirical results suggest a much less dramatic dependence on number of experts.
