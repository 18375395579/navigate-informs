In reactive environments, the method matches the performance of the best expert, but bounds on convergence rate suggest a severe dependence on number of experts. We explore proximity metrics among experts to speed up convergence. A simple scheme is shown to asymptotically perform as well as the best expert. Empirical results suggest a much less dramatic dependence on number of experts.</br>
