We determine under what market and regulatory conditions an NGO should target the industry versus a regulatory body in order to influence firms to replace a substance. We consider the perspectives of both an antagonistic NGO that maintains an arms-length relationship with firms and a pragmatic NGO that takes into consideration firm costs when making its decisions.</br>
