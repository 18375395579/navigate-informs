<br>Title: On Approaching Upstream and Downstream Logistic Problems at Petrobras</br><br>Author: Thiago Serra, Operations Research Analyst, PETROBRAS, Avenida Paulista, 901, São Paulo, SP, 01311-100, Brazil, thiago.serra@petrobras.com.br</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel F. Ferber, Daniel G. E. Trovo</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present two operations research applications in logistic problems faced by Petrobras. The first concerns the scheduling of rigs and vessels to develop offshore oil wells. It involves the assignment and scheduling of resources to developments, resource maintenance and loading of inventory. The second is related to the transference planning of oil refined commodities on a pipeline network. It comprises tactical aspects such as capacity for in-transit inventory, transit time and flow reversal.</br>
