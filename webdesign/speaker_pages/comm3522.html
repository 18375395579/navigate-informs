Title: Submission Transparency in Idea Generation<br>Author: Joel Wooten, University of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America, jwooten@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karl Ulrich<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In innovation tournaments, administrators face a variety of decisions that impact the course of the contest. We examine the effect of submission transparency by comparing blind and unblind contests using innovation tournament field experiments. We control submission visibility and show individual-level differences in idea quality and uniqueness from the tournament participants - the solvers.
