Title: Are We There Yet?  The Marriage Between Simulation and Optimization<br>Author: Michael Fu, Professor, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, mfu@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Arguably the two most powerful operations research techniques implemented in software are simulation and optimization, so it is natural to consider wedding these two techniques, and over the past decade most commercial simulation software packages began offering some sort of an optimization module.  However, continuing a theme in my 2002 INFORMS Journal on Computing Feature Article, I argue that current software offers mainly marriages of convenience rather than well-integrated partnerships.
