<br>Title: Ties that Bind? The Differential Ability of de alio and de novo Firms to Leverage External Relations</br><br>Author: Glenn Hoetker, Associate Professor, W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University, PO Box 874006, Tempe, AZ, 85287-4006, United States of America, Glenn.Hoetker@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pao-Lien Chen, Rajshree Agarwal</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: External relationships may help a firm learn about disruptive technological changes, but may also impede the firm's adopting new technologies.  We examine the impact of a firm's pre-entry experience on its dynamic capability to maximize learning and minimize inertia created by ties to suppliers. We find that de alio firms better harness information available through a larger network of suppliers than de novo firms, but are equally constrained by the length of prior relationships.</br>
