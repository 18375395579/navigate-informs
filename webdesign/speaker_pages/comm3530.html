This study develops a new non-homogenous Poisson process approach to short-term demand forecast. By considering seasonality and heterogeneous booking curve patterns, we find better estimates for demand processes and thus improve forecasting accuracy. We present validation results on IHG hotel data along with a comparison to other benchmark models.</br>
