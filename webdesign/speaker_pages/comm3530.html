Title: Improving the Forecasting Accuracy of Hotel Arrivals: A New Non-homogeneous Poisson Roach<br>Author: Misuk Lee, IHG, 3 Ravinia Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30327, United States of America, Misuk.Lee@ihg.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Demand forecast is one of key components of hotel revenue management. This study develops a new non-homogenous Poisson process approach to short-term demand forecast. By considering seasonality and heterogeneous booking curve patterns, we find better estimates for demand processes and thus improve forecasting accuracy. We present validation results on IHG hotel data along with a comparison to other benchmark models.
