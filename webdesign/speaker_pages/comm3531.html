Title: Multiscale Hierarchical Modeling of Nanowire Growth Processes<br>Author: Qiang Huang, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, huangq@eng.usf.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Quality control of nanomanufacturing processes faces new challenges of scale effects. This talk presents multiscale hierarchical modeling of nanowire growth processes. The model integrates growth kinetics which facilitates in situ control in nanomanufacturing.
