Recently, websites have begun to offer social networks as well, creating a dual-network structure. We use data from YouTube and investigate the role of this dual-network structure in facilitating content exploration.We also present seven internet studies in which participants, browsing a YouTube-based website, are exposed to different conditions of recommendations.
