<br>Title: Controling the Dose with Convex gEUD-type Constraints in Radiotherapy Optimization Framework</br><br>Author: Yuriy Zinchenko, AdvOL, CAS, McMaster University, 1280 Main str W, ITB 221, Hamilton, ON, L5A3Y4, Canada, zinchen@mcmaster.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the possibility of including the dose prescription, specified by the Dose Volume Histogram (DVH), within the convex optimization framework for inverse radiotherapy treatment planning. Specifically, we study the quality of approximating a given DVH with a superset of generalized Equivalent Uniform Dose (gEUD)-based constraints, the so-called Generalized Moment Constraints (GMC's). As a bi-product, we establish an analytic relationship between a DVH and a sequence of gEUD values.</br>
