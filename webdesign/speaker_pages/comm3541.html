<br>Title: Large Deviations for Random Walks under Subexponentiality: The Big-jump Domain</br><br>Author: Ton Dieker, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of ISyE, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, ton.dieker@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Denis Denisov, Vsevolod Shneer</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Stimulated by applications to internet traffic modeling and insurance mathematics, distributions with heavy tails have been widely studied over the past decades. This talk addresses a fundamental large-deviation problem for random walks with heavy-tailed step-size distributions. Our investigations are motivated by the so-called single-server busy period problem with heavy tails, which will also be discussed.</br>
