<br>Title: Novelty and Collective Attention</br><br>Author: Fang Wu, HP Labs, 1501 Page Mill Rd, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, United States, fang.wu@hp.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bernardo Huberman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: To understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations, we have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among one million users of an interactive website ?digg.com - devoted to thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor which decays with a stretched-exponential law, suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.</br>
