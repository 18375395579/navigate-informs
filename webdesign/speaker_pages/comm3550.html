Analysis of Sourcing Strategies under Competition<br>Author: Fuqiang Zhang, Olin Business School, Washington University, St. Louis, United States of America, Fzhang22@wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiaole Wu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by the recent trend of backshoring, this paper studies a sourcing game where competing firms may choose between efficient sourcing (e.g., sourcing from an international supplier) and responsive sourcing (e.g., sourcing from a domestic supplier). By  characterizing the equilibrium outcome, we find some interesting results driven by the information structure of the sourcing game.
