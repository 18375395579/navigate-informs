Title: The Impact of Flexibility and Capacity Allocation on the Performance of Primary Care Practices<br>Author: Xiaoling Gao, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 160 Governors Drive, Amherst, MA, United States of America, xiaoling@engin.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ana Muriel, Hari Balasubramanian<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We adapt ideas of manufacturing process flexibility to the management of continuity and timely access in primary care practices. Timely access focuses on the ability of a patient to get access to a physician. Continuity refers to building a strong relationship between patient and physician by maximizing patient visits. We develop a two-stage stochastic integer program to investigate optimal capacity allocation for prescheduled and same-day patients, and the value of different flexible policies.
