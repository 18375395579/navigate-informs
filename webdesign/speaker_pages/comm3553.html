<br>Title: Optimal Partitioning of Vertical Zones in Vehicle-based Warehouse System</br><br>Author: Debjit Roy, Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, Wing 3C, Vastrapur, India, debjit@iimahd.ernet.in</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anand Kumar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle-based Storage and Retrieval (AVS/R) system offer greater flexibility and responsiveness in processing unit-load S/R transactions in high-density storage areas. This research is a first attempt to model a “zone-captive?AVS/R system and understand the effect of number and boundary of vertical zones on system performance measures.</br>
