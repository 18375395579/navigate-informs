<br>Title: Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for Pharmaceuticals</br><br>Author: Isil Alev, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, isilalev@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Atalay Atasu, Ozlem Ergun, Beril Toktay</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: EPR regulations, which hold producers physically and financially responsible for environmentally safe treatment of their end-of-life products, are gaining traction in context of managing unused pharmaceuticals. In our work, we build a game-theoretic model focusing on the interactions between manufacturers, insurance companies, physicians and patients to analyze the effectiveness of various EPR policies and uncover efficiency conditions for socially optimal pharmaceutical collection programs.</br>
