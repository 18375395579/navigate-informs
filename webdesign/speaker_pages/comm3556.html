Title: Hide Sensitive Association Rules and Maximizing Accuracy<br>Author: Syam Menon, Associate Professor of Information Systems, University of Texas at Dallas, 2601 N. Floyd Rd., SM 33, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States, syam@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sumit Sarkar<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We focus on the problem of hiding sensitive association rules in shared databases.  Hiding is usually achieved by altering selected transactions in such a way that they no longer support the sensitive association rules.  The database should be altered as little as possible in order to maximize the benefits of sharing.  We use accuracy as the measure of the quality of the altered database, and present optimal approaches to maximize the accuracy of the shared database.
