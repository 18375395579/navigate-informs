Title: A Model to Analyze the Impact of P2P Networks on the Market for Content Provision and Distribution<br>Author: Monica Johar, msjohar@email.uncc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nanda Kumar, Vijay Mookerjee<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop an economic model to investigate the recent thinking that the development of P2P networks will pose a serious threat to firms in the business of providing content distribution services (e.g., Akamai). Our model considers the incentives of the producer (the content provider, e.g., CNN) together with the incentives of the consumer (who derives a positive utility from consuming the content) to derive the optimal extent of content distribution, with and without the existence of a P2P.
