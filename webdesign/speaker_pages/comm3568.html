The participants for this project include students at universities in Scotland, Taiwan, and Mexico as well as at the Iowa State University. Specifically, we show how the teams from the four nations are organized and managed. Also, we provide outcome assessment on various team aspects such as team dynamics and leadership. Lessons and future directions will be discussed.
