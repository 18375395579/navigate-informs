Title: Measurement and Improvement of Environmental Performance under Voluntary versus Mandatory Disclosure<br>Author: Basak Kalkanci, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, United States of America, kalkanci@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Erica Plambeck, Erjie Ang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: When a firm exerts effort to evaluate its social & environmental impacts, it finds opportunities to reduce them (and hence its risks associated with future regulation). We investigate when a firm should learn and disclose its impact (accounting for the response from consumers and investors) and whether policy makers should mandate disclosure. Experimentally, we show that voluntary disclosure can boost sales.
