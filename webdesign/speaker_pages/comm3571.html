Title: Prediction of Power System Flexibility Requirements and Tail Events using Bayesian Network<br>Author: Shuai Lu, Pacific Northwest National Lab, 902 Battelle Blvd, P.O. Box 999 MSIN K1-85, Richland, WA, 99354-1793, United States of America, shuai.lu@pnnl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Shuangshuang Jin, Yuri Makarov, Alan Brothers, Craig McKinstry, John Pease<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Maintaining system flexibility to balance load and generation becomes more challenging with increasing penetration of PV and wind. This talk will present a Bayesian Network (BN) model for the prediction of real-time balancing requirements. The BN model captures the statistical relationship between generation/load imbalance and forecast errors, generation schedule control errors, as well as other factors, providing information to system operators to better manage system balancing reserves.
