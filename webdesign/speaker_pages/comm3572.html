S. Krishnan, Sunil Mithas</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop and validate a framework of Human Resources (HR) and Information Technology (IT) alignment.  First, we examine the interaction between innovative HR-related work practices and specific IT-related practices in firm productivity outcomes. Next, we examine quantitative firm productivity impacts of IT investment and innovative HR-related work practices in the work of IT professionals. We utilize both objective economic metrics and managers' subjective assessments of firm productivity.</br>
