First, we examine the interaction between innovative HR-related work practices and specific IT-related practices in firm productivity outcomes. Next, we examine quantitative firm productivity impacts of IT investment and innovative HR-related work practices in the work of IT professionals. We utilize both objective economic metrics and managers' subjective assessments of firm productivity.
