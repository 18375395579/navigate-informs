<br>Title: Mary Worth (or Calvin and Hobbes or Charlie Brown or Opus...) Teaches Operations Research</br><br>Author: James Cochran, Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA, United States of America, jcochran@latech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aadel Darrat</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We report on the use of scripting in an introductory statistics course. We obtained a series of related color panels featuring two characters of the Mary Worth comic strip. We then removed all dialogue, thoughts, and narration, and instructed students to write dialogue, thoughts, and narration so that one character explained a concept (trimmed mean or covariance). Results from an experiment utilizing a completely randomized design are discussed, and examples of student efforts are presented.</br>
