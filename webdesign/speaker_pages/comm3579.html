<br>Title: COIN-OR/GAMSlinks: Hooking Your Solver to GAMS</br><br>Author: Steven Dirkse, GAMS Development Corp., 1217 Potomac St., NW, Washington, DC, 20007, United States of America, sdirkse@gams.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stefan Vigerske, Michael Bussieck</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The GAMSlinks project at COIN-OR is dedicated to the development of  links between GAMS and open source (e.g. COIN-OR) solvers. These links  broaden the audience for COIN-OR solvers and provide solver developers  with the quality assurance and benchmarking tools that come with GAMS.  We show how to use the GAMSlinks project, highlight non-standard  features of the present interfaces, give a short introduction on how  to link your own solver to GAMS, and speculate about future  developments.</br>
