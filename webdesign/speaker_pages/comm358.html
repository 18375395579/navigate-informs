Taking into account the uncertain demand that may occur under various possible pandemic scenarios, we consider the problem of determining the stockpile quantity of one critical medical item.  A game theoretical framework is used to capture any mutual aid agreement that a group of hospitals may have. A discussion on the implications of the game results will be presented.
