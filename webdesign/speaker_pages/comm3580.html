<br>Title: Framing, Privacy Settings, and the Limitations of Choice in Addressing Consumer Privacy Risks</br><br>Author: Idris Adjerid, Carnegie Mellon University, 500 Forbes Avenue, Hamburg Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15123, United States of America, iadjerid@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alessandro Acquisti, George Loewenstein</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The collection of personal information by online firms presents an opportunity to uncover insights about consumers but also raises consumer privacy concerns. Policy makers posit that increased consumer choice will alleviate these concerns and reduce risks. We find that subtle variation in the framing of privacy relevant choices can predictably impact the choice of privacy protective options. Our result suggests that choice alone, may not be enough to address consumer privacy concerns.</br>
