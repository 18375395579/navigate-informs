Two Tests of Dynamic Inconsistency</br><br>Author: Daniel Read, Professor of Behavioural Economics, Durham Business School, Mill Hill Lane, Durham, DH1 3LB, United Kingdom, daniel.read2@durham.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shane Frederick</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe two new and careful tests for hyperbolic discounting.  Respondents chose between smaller-sooner (SS) and larger-later (LL) monetary amounts, both weeks before receiving SS, and immediately before.  Hyperbolic discounting predicts more impatient shifts (from LL to SS) than impatient ones (SS to LL).  In fact, however, both were equally likely.  We argue that previous evidence of inconsistent planning reflected non-discounting processes not eliminated by the experimental design.</br>
