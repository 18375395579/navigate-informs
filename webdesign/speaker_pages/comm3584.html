<br>Title: Error Equivalence Methodology in Quality Prediction and Control</br><br>Author: Qiang Huang, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, huangq@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Wang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Error equivalence, an engineering phenomenon concerning the mechanism that different error sources result in identical dimensional variation patterns, impacts almost every stage of quality control, from tolerance synthesis in engineering design to root cause identification in manufacturing. This proposed research seeks to establish the science basis for quantitatively analyzing the error equivalence phenomenon to achieve better control of product dimensional quality.</br>
