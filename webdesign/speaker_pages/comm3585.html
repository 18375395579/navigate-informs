The state of this system is estimated from noisy observations by applying filtering theory. Moreover, the sequence of optimal actions of an agent who takes the error of predicted variables into account is compared to an agent who is blind to it. The result shows that  uncertainty of parameters usually induces risk averse agents to choose the higher trading volume.</br>
