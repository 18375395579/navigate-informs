Title: Capacity Planning for Cancer Prevention<br>Author: Aaron Ratcliffe, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 3490, Chapel Hill, NC, 27514, United States of America, Aaron_Ratcliffe@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ann Marucheck, Wendell Gilland<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We analyze a queuing network to study the relationship between screening guidelines and capacity planning for colorectal cancer. The screen provider chooses its capacity to balance the cost of cancer detection delay with the cost of additional capacity. Patients spend a random time at home before scheduling a repeat screen. We consider the impact of other provider interventions such as price changes and education efforts about screening guidelines.
