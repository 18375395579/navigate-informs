Title: High Level Data Fusion Using Graph Matching and State Space Search<br>Author: Rakesh Nagi, Professor, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, 438 Bell Hall, University at Buffalo (SUNY), Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, nagi@buffalo.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We use attributed graph models to represent situations in Level 2 and 3 fusion (situational awareness and impact assessment). Graph matching is invoked to determine if a situation of interest to the analyst (template graph) exists in a scenario (data graph). A Truncated Search Tree heuristic is developed to perform graph matching.
