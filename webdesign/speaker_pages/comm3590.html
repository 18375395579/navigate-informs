Title: A Program Evaluation Framework for Business Analytics<br>Author: Paul McCarthy, Senior Economist, Ford Motor Credit Company, Dearborn, MI, United States of America, pmccart4@ford.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges presented in evaluating the impact of changes in business practices where there is little or no control of experimental design. By structuring the analytics / business interaction around an explicit framework for quantifying and reporting results, we have been able to improve the quality of the analytics while increasing buy-in from the non-analytic partners, and facilitated a learning process with feedback to new program design.
