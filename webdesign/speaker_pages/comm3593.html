<br>Title: A Mathematical Approach to Identifying and Forecasting Shifts in the Mood of Social Media</br><br>Author: Les Servi, The MITRE Corporation, 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA, 01730, United States of America, lservi@mitre.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sara Beth Elson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Public mood is examined by: (i)  running an existing system, LIWC,  to estimate the emotional intensity of individual tweets; (ii) infer the dynamics of the aggregate mood after first  detecting times where those mood changed abruptly, and (iii) forecast future moods.
