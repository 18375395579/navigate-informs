Title: The Entrepreneurial Newsvendor: Impact of Information Asymmetry on Debt, Hedging and Profitability<br>Author: Fehmi Tanrisever, Assistant Professor, Eindhoven  University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, Netherlands, F.Tanrisever@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Sinan Erzurumlu, Nitin Joglekar, Moren Levesque<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine production problem in a special setting, termed the Entrepreneurial Newsvendor. The newsvendor needs to raise debt to fund the R&D in the presence of information asymmetry. We show that the decision to defer investment in such R&D can be employed as an operational hedge against future under-production problems. Through such an operational hedge, the firm can also mitigate the effects of information asymmetry and create value by enhancing its access to capital.
