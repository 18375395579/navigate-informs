We survey old iteration-complexity results for the the Vavasis-Ye and the MTY predictor-corrector algorithms.  We also present complexity results for a new predictor-corrector trust region algorithm. We end the talk by surveying results about the geometric structure of the central path in terms of its curvature.</br>
