Title: Complexity Results for Path Following Algorithms for Linear Programming<br>Author: Renato Monteiro, Professor, ISyE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States, monteiro@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Takashi Tsuchiya, Guanghui Lan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk, we discuss complexities of path following algorithms for linear programming which take into account the geometry of the central path. We survey old iteration-complexity results for the the Vavasis-Ye and the MTY predictor-corrector algorithms.  We also present complexity results for a new predictor-corrector trust region algorithm. We end the talk by surveying results about the geometric structure of the central path in terms of its curvature.
