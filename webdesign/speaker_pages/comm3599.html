Due to complexities and uncertainties surrounding pandemic influenza, mathematical models are needed to answer policy questions.  We discuss the construction of a pandemic influenza model that incorporates both age and comorbidities in a population.  We examine the impact of targeting various interventions to specific age and comorbid groups.
