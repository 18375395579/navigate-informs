<br>Title: Examining Policies for Pandemic Influenza Targeted to Age Groups and Those with Comorbid Conditions</br><br>Author: David Hutton, Professor, University of Michigan, 1420 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, dwhutton@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yoshi Gillaspie, Nayer Khazeni</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Current pandemic and seasonal influenza mitigation plans target age groups and those with comorbid conditions.  Due to complexities and uncertainties surrounding pandemic influenza, mathematical models are needed to answer policy questions.  We discuss the construction of a pandemic influenza model that incorporates both age and comorbidities in a population.  We examine the impact of targeting various interventions to specific age and comorbid groups.</br>
