Title: Hyperpath Equilibrium Models to Simulate Adaptive Routing Behavior<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas, Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ravi Venkatraman, Avinash Unnikrishnan, Rachel James<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: An interactive online game is conducted to study adaptive routing behavior under the conditions of complete en-route information.  In particular, this game aims to see how well drivers can use information, compared to the theoretical optimum value based on an online shortest path algorithm.  Several behavioral contexts are studied.
