<br>Title: Arbitrage Pricing of Contingent Claims in Incomplete Markets</br><br>Author: Chanaka Edirisinghe, Professor, Management Science, University of Tennessee, College of Business Administration, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States of America, chanaka@utk.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Pricing contingent claims is addressed using discrete-time multi-period scenario trees. Previously, we developed a simplicial DP procedure for pricing under incomplete markets, but with no trading costs. Introducing proportional costs for trading, results are generalized. In particular, sub- and super-martingales are identified for the pricing problem via an underlying moment problem solution.</br>
