<br>Title: An Empirical Study of Reciprocity and Search Strategies in Online Barter Markets</br><br>Author: Shun Ye, Assistant Professor, George Mason University, Enterprise Hall 138, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, sye2@gmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Siva Viswanathan, Il-Horn Hann</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study examines users?search strategies and their impacts on transaction outcomes in online barter markets. We find that whereas users who adopt the immediate reciprocity strategy are able to motivate higher service quality for the current transaction, users who adopt the delayed reciprocity strategy derive more benefits for future transactions. We further find that market participants with different trading needs and psychographic profiles employ different search strategies in the market.</br>
