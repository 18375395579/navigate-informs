Langella, Faculty of Economics and Management, University of Magdeburg, Universitaetsplatz 2, Magdeburg, 39106, Germany, ian.langella@ww.uni-magdeburg.de<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk will present product recovery operations currently in place at an automobile manufacturer. The case will highlight the complexity involved in planning, both from a short-term operational standpoint as well as considering the more broad view over the entire product life cycle of a specific engine. When viewed from this prospective, better product design might allow for more cost effective recovery operations and interesting interactions between economic and environmental goals emerge.
