While prior research has studied the impact of those informational spillovers on the R&D intensity, we focus on the direction of the R&D search path. Our analysis reveals strong path dependencies and characterizes the conditions under which a firm benefits from exploiting past research efforts (generated by rivals) versus exploring a new domain.</br>
