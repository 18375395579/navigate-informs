Title: Evolution of Bidders?Willingness to Pay in Sequential Auctions<br>Author: Gilbert Karuga, Assistant Professor, University of Kansas, 1300 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS, 66045, United States, gkaruga@ku.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paulo Goes, Arvind Tripathi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate how bidders in online sequential auctions learn from available information, form and update their willingness to pay.  We analyze the learning and bidding strategies of the bidders as well as the effect of auction design on bidders?willingness-to-pay in sequential auctions. We show that bidders?willingness to pay in sequential auctions is driven by previous auction participation experience, past auction outcomes, and auction design parameters.
