Title: Incorporation of Emerging Technologies for Environmentally Conscious Energy Production Systems<br>Author: Metin Turkay, Assistant Professor, Koc University, Rumelifeneri Yolu, Istanbul, 34450, Turkey, mturkay@ku.edu.tr<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Industrial systems require energy for production, therefore the supply of energy is as important as the supply of any other raw material. It became a requirement to incorporate new technologies due to stricter environmental reglations in energy systems. In this talk, environmentally friendly technologies will be evaluated and an optimization model that considers some emerging technologies that are applicable in the short-term will be presented.
