State Street, Chicago, IL, United States of America, durango-cohen@iit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pablo Durango-Cohen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a framework to support marketing (e.g., direct mailing) efforts at a public broadcasting station. We develop/implement an instance of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm to cluster the target population into homogeneous segments, and to optimize (revenue-maximize) the marketing strategy for each segment.  Computational results and managerial insights will be discussed.
