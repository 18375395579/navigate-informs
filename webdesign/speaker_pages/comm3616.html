Title: Operations Research and the Area Bombing of Nazi Germany<br>Author: Maurice Kirby, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom, m.kirby@lancaster.ac.uk<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper revisits the author's original research on the role of Operations Research (OR) in informing the tactics and strategy of the Allied airforces in relation to the campaign of 'area attack' launched against Germany in 1942.  Contributions to the literature on the 'morality' of area bombing and its contribution to Germany's defeat are ongoing, but the role of OR in justifying the bombing of civilian targets is rarely acknowledged.  This paper reasserts the case for area bombing as a moral and entirely rational means of engaging with Nazi Germany in advance of the D-Day landings.
