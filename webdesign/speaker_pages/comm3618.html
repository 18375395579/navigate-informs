<br>Title: Scheduling Policies for Counter-Terrorist Surveillance System</br><br>Author: Kyle Lin, Assistant Professor, Operations Research Department, Naval Postgraduate School, Glasgow Hall 260, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, kylin@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Moshe Kress, Roberto Szechtman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A counter-terrorist surveillance system usually does not have the capacity to screen all suspects in an open area.  If the sojourn time distribution of a terrorist is different from that of the others, then potentially we can improve the probability of catching a terrorist by carefully choosing which suspect to inspect.  We use a queueing model and develop a heuristic policy that works well in an area with heavy traffic.</br>
