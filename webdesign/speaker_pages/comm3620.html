Title: Reinforcement Learning with Sub-Action Abstraction<br>Author: Shahar Cohen, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, shaharco@post.tau.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Evgeni Khmelnitsky, Oded Maimon<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Representation abstraction in reinforcement learning enables the agent to ignore irrelevant aspects of the underlined task. The learning process, when incorporating representation abstraction, can be made faster and easier. The literature on reinforcement learning has only focused on a single form of representation abstraction, widely-known as state abstraction. In this work we propose a new form of representation abstraction.
