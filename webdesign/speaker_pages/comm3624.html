Title: The Model Design on Extreme Climate Change in Integrated Assessment Model<br>Author: Cheng-Marshal Wang, EC, 80 Westpointe Crescent, Ottawa, ON, K2G 5Y9, Canada, Cheng-Marshal.Wang@ec.gc.ca<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: If we are still forward-looking global warming, why there was 0 Celsius degree with 15cm snow in Minneapolis on April 11 2013 but 29 degree in Charlottesville VA on the same day. Should Canada get benefit on global warming? Is Oilsands the principal offender of global warming?   How to explain climate change to public? We have tried to model design on quantifying extreme climate change instead of global temperature in our IAM.
