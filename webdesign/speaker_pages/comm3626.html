Naturally occurring biological threats already exhibit a pattern of increasing difficulty of detection, more subtle and complex attack pathways, taking advantage of social stigmas attached to some conditions, and exploitation of our own resources against us. Tests of a few proposed metrics lead to some disturbing conclusions.</br>
