Title: Can We Detect 'The Coming Plague'?<br>Author: Doug Samuelson, Principal Decision Scientist, Serco-NA, 8711 Chippendale Court, Annandale, VA, 22003, United States of America, samuelsondoug@yahoo.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We analyze metrics that could help us detect natural and human-caused outbreaks of infectious diseases and assess long-term health consequences of disasters. Naturally occurring biological threats already exhibit a pattern of increasing difficulty of detection, more subtle and complex attack pathways, taking advantage of social stigmas attached to some conditions, and exploitation of our own resources against us. Tests of a few proposed metrics lead to some disturbing conclusions.
