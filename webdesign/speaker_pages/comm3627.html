A major obstacle for employing such an approach is often the inability to explicitly form the constraint Jacobian and, consequently, to factor the KKT matrix.  We study alternatives to direct factorization and remark on related issues such as inertia control, inexactness in step computation, and appropriate merit functions.</br>
