Title: General-Purpose Optimization Techniques for Partial-Differential-Equation-Constrained Problems<br>Author: Frank Curtis, Graduate Student, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, C230, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, fecurt@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jorge Nocedal<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate optimization-specific issues that arise when attempting to apply a SQP method to equality-constrained problems defined by systems of differential equations.  A major obstacle for employing such an approach is often the inability to explicitly form the constraint Jacobian and, consequently, to factor the KKT matrix.  We study alternatives to direct factorization and remark on related issues such as inertia control, inexactness in step computation, and appropriate merit functions.
