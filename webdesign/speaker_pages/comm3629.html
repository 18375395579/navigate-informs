Title: Optimal Truncation in Matching Markets<br>Author: Ran Shorrer, PhD Student, Harvard University, 11 Peabody Terrace, Apt. 510, Cambridge, Ma, 02138, United States of America, rshorrer@hbs.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Coles<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Recent studies have presented conditions under which truthful reporting by all participants in a two-sided matching market is close to optimal. Our results demonstrate that in large uniform markets with incomplete information, using the Men-Proposing Deferred Acceptance Algorithm, each woman's best response to truthful behavior by all other agents is to truncate her list substantially. In fact, the optimal degree of truncation goes to 100% of her list as the market size grows large.
