Title: Debris Removal During Disaster Response Phase: A Case For Turkey<br>Author: Bahar Kara, Assoc. Prof., Bilkent University, Bilkent Universitesi, Endustri Muh., Ankara, 06800, Turkey, bkara@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Oya Karasan, Halenur Sahin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Proper removal of debris has significant importance since it blocks the roads and prohibits emergency aid teams to access the disaster affected regions. The focus of this study is  to develop mathematical models that select the paths in order to transport emergency aid materials in the presence of debris to the pre-determined disaster affected regions. The performances of the models are tested on two distinct data sets from Istanbul.  Since it is crucial to act quickly in an emergency case, a constructive and an improvement heuristic are also proposed.
