Title: Will Marie Antoinette Eat Bread? Quality Consciousness, Perceived Value and Product Design<br>Author: Sreekumar Bhaskaran, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, United States of America, sbhaskar@mail.cox.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karthik Ramachandran, Priyali Rajagopal<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we provide experimental evidence that the perceived quality of a product varies systematically with the quality consciousness of consumers. Specifically, more quality conscious consumers perceive low-end (or, high-end) products to be of even lower (or, higher) quality than less quality conscious consumers. Analytical implications of this new discovery are also explored
