Title: Estimating Class Probabilities Using Tree Ensembles<br>Author: Dragos Margineantu, The Boeing Company, dragos.d.margineantu@boeing.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Averaging probability estimation models and changing internal mechanisms of decision tree induction have proven to make trees better probability estimators. This presentation will review the techniques that make the Bagged Probability Estimation Trees and the Bagged Lazy Option Trees good probability estimation techniques. We will analyze the individual contribution of the mechanisms employed by these classes of methods: not pruning trees, the laziness, the options in trees, and Bagging.
