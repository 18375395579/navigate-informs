<br>Title: From Idea to Product ?Translating Knowledge between the Lab and the Clinic</br><br>Author: Ayfer Ali, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, aali@emp.uc3m.es</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In my research I explore knowledge translation from the laboratory bench to the clinic and back. Using patent and licensing data from two of the largest Academic Medical Centers in the US, I explore team knowledge composition and its influence on translation. I also explore the demand side of markets for technology and the importance of existing technology on the decision to in-license an invention.</br>
