Surgery delays occur due to many reasons; scheduled appointment duration being under direct control of hospital administrators. With the goal of reducing operating room over-scheduling, we develop a model that predicts under-scheduled surgery appointments using historic appointment data in the MEDITECH Data Repository with 84% accuracy 17% improvement over naïve rule.</br>
