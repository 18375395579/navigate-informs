<br>Title: Leverage, Options Liabilities, and Corporate Bond Pricing</br><br>Author: Yildiray Yildirim, Associate Professor, Syracuse University, Management-Finance, Whitman SOM-Suite 615, Syracuse, NY, United States of America, yildiray@syr.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hueng-Ming Huang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper imposes option liabilities on the firm’s capital structure to resolve the drawbacks of the Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001) model in explaining credit spread. We find that the credit spread overestimation problem in the CDG (2001) model can be resolved by combining option liabilities and the regime-switching interest rate process when dealing with an investment grade bond, whereas with junk bonds, only the regime-switching interest rate process is needed.</br>
