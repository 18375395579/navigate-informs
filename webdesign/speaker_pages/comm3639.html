WHP consists of 18 divisions which undertake the patrol operations under different external conditions such as traffic volumes, climate, etc. This presentation discusses a DEA-based performance assessment system that will enable WHP to identify its best-performing (i.e., most efficient) divisions to be able to use those as internal benchmarks.</br>
