Title: Productivity Measurement for Local Public Services<br>Author: John Ruggiero, Associate Professor of Economics, University of Dayton, John.Ruggiero@notes.udayton.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The measurement of efficiency and productivity in local public services like education require controls for nondiscretionary inputs.  These factors of production are beyond the control of decision makers and hence, must be treated as exogenous.  In this presentation, we provide a method that simulataneously controls for these factors while measuring productivity and efficiency.
