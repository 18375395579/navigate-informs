Title: Modelling Ambulance Location and Deployment<br>Author: Leanne Smith, Cardiff University, School of Mathematics, Cardiff University, Senghennydd Rd, Cardiff, CF24 4AG, United Kingdom, SmithL13@cardiff.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Harper, Vincent Knight, Janet Williams<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Response time targets for the Welsh ambulance service (WAST) are not currently being met, particularly for high priority emergencies in rural areas. A discrete event simulation makes use of initial vehicle allocations from a developed location model, in order to identify the affect demand and numbers of available vehicles have on regional response. The research aims to assist WAST in location, capacity and deployment decisions, so that they may provide a more efficient service to the population.
