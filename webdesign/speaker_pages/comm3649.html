There is a belief that the complex and concurrent development of services makes this either impossible or impractical. Unfortunately in the absence of comprehension it is certain that services will continue to be plagued with poor delivery and efficiency improvement. These challenges could be largely overcome by exploiting abstract models as a communication medium.</br>
