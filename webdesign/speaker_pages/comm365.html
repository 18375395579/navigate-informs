Using tools from Bayesian statistical decision theory, we formulate the allocation problem as a Bayesian Markov Decision Process (MDP).  To address the computational challenge, we propose a new approximate policy, called optimistic knowledge gradient policy, which is a consistent policy and leads to superior empirical performance.</br>
