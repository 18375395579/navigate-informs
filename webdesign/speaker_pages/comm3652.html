<br>Title: The Human Cost of Complexity: How System Architecture Affects Developer Productivity</br><br>Author: Alan MacCormack, Harvard Business School, Soldiers Field, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, amaccormack@hbs.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Sturtevant</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Prior work shows that systems with greater complexity suffer greater quality problems, in terms of experiencing defects.  Few studies however, examine the human costs of complexity - that is, the impact on the productivity of system developers.  We explore this relationship in a commercial software system.  We find that i) developer productivity is impacted by where in the system architecture they work, and ii) only skilled developers are allowed to work on the most complex parts of the system.</br>
