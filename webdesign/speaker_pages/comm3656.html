Title: Delaying the Revelation of Information in a Social Learning Model<br>Author: Kostas Bimpikis, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, kostasb@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kimon Drakopoulos<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a model of strategic experimentation motivated by collective decision making with costly information acquisition or R&D and the innovation process.  When the outcomes of experimentation are observable, free-riding results in inefficiently low experimentation. When an information aggregator holds all  information and commits when to reveal it, efficiency increases.
