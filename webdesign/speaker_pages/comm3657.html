Title: Peter Hammer and the Roof-duality Adventure<br>Author: Bruno Simeone, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, bruno.simeone@uniroma1.it<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The theory of Roof-Duality is a unique synthesis of Peter Hammer's three main research interests: binary optimization, Boolean functions, and graphs. Initiated by Hammer, Hansen, and the writer towards the end of the 70's, it has since then been the subject of ramifications and extensions by Hammer himself and many of his students and collaborators.   Eight characterizations will be reviewed. Recently, the impressive computational results of G. Tavares have  spurred  a revival of this theory.
