Title: Stochastic Game Models for the Liver Transplant Waitlist<br>Author: Gordon Hazen, Professor, Northwestern University, IEMS Department, McCormick School of Engineering, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States of America, gbh305@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anton Skaro, Zhe Li, James Schummer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A 2007 Federal mandate requires an increase in marginal quality liver transplant offers.  To investigate the response of the liver waitlist to increases/decreases in marginal quality organ offers, we construct stochastic game models in which players are waitlist members.  We demonstrate the existence of Markov perfect equilibria, as well as oblivious equilibria for this system, devise methods for computing these, and report predictions of waitlist behavior under more/fewer marginal organ offers.
