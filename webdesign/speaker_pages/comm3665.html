TQM and Operational Risk have received an enormous amount of attention from academicians as well as from practitioners. However, these topics have been kept somewhat separate in the literature. We consider TQM and Operational Risk in four types of service industries, namely transportation, health care, financial services, and hospitality industries. We compare the types of losses that can be incurred in each type of industry, the measurements of the losses, and the risk mitigation processes and show how TQM should be seen as part of a robust operational risk management process.</br>
