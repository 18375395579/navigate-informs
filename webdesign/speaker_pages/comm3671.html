Using multiscale decision theory, we analyze the interaction between health care stakeholders across multiple levels. We identify incentive mechanism given multiscale interdependencies that can align stakeholders?actions. Our findings can inform incentive alignment for Accountable Care Organizations and the Medicare Shared Savings Program.
