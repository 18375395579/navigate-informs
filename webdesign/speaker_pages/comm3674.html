If decision making is decentralized, such as in white collar teams working on knowledge intensive projects, much less is known about how team members allocate resources and respond to their mutual interdependence. Two means of balancing are possible: either team members help out at the bottleneck, or they adjust their efforts to the bottleneck. We compare these two ways of balancing in a game theoretic framework.</br>
