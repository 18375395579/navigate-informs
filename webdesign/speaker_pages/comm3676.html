Title: Decision Making with Delayed Resolution of Uncertainty: Measurement of Anxiety.<br>Author: Enrico Diecidue, Assistant Professor, INSEAD, Bd. de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, enrico.diecidue@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mohammed Abdellaoui, Ayse Onculer<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In most real decisions a considerable time between the choice and the resolution of uncertainty may occur. Individuals may have preferences between gambles that have the same probability distribution over outcomes if they differ in the timing of resolution of uncertainty. Goal of this paper is to elicit individual probability weighting functions with and without delayed resolution of uncertainty.
