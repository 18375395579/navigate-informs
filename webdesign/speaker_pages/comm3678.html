The focus of these has been on the potential winning candidate and who will or did vote for him or her.  Seldom have there been surveys that asked voters about the voting experience itself. This paper discusses a proposal for such a poll.  Issues of design are covered, with sampling and especially nonsampling issues given prominence. There have been smaller efforts of this sort in 2004 and 2006, but not a national attempt.  Our focus then will be on what in other contexts might be called a national customer satisfaction survey.  Key here, of course, is obtaining the interviews before the winners are announced.</br>
