The current practice of price-matching employed by retailers has yielded mixed results. Retailers therefore need to better engage with customers while they are in the store. We propose a real-time, mobile-enabled, personalized coupon optimization method to increase profitability and minimize lost sales.  We provide illustrative computational examples and discuss the results.</br>
