Title: A Complex Process Of Forming A Regional Financial Arrangement (RFA)<br>Author: Iwan Azis, Professor, Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, 215 W. Sibley, Ithaca, NY, United States, ija1@cornell.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In East Asia, the most decisive event that created interest for a closer regional cooperation was the 1997/98 financial crisis. Ineffective policy responses to a crisis, slow progress of WTO, growing risks of global imbalance, and strong interest among business sectors to access foreign markets and capital, are among the important reasons for such proliferations. The preferred form of cooperation developed using the ANP suggests that RFA w/o a common currency basket is most suitable.
