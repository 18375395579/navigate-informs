Title: The Effect of Evolving Software Complexity on Open Source Co-developer Participation<br>Author: Rajiv Jayant, PhD Candidate, School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 West Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, rajiv@utdallas.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this study, we examine the effect of software complexity on co-developer activity as OSS projects evolve over time. Co-developers act as maintainers by fixing bugs and creating new features. However, with OSS being a voluntary activity, it is hard to know apriori if the software will be maintained once adopted. To this end, we develop a model for the pattern of co-developer participation over time. The results of  testing this model on real world OSS projects are presented and discussed.
