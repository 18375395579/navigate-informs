<br>Title: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards: Reflections on Definitions of OR by Morse and Kimball</br><br>Author: Richard Larson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, rclarson@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Saul Gass was a consummate modeler and an exemplary member of the OR community. He was in at the beginnings of OR and provided stalwart mentorship to those younger than him throughout his career. He was an old-time OR guy. In appreciation of that, we honor Saul by going back to the beginnings and examine OR as Morse and Kimball defined it in the 1950's and then project forward. In honor of Saul, we hope to be able to elucidate a few extreme points.</br>
