Title: Incentive-compatible Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks and Two-commodity Markets<br>Author: Tara Javidi, UCSD, 9500 Gilman Dr., La Jolla, CA, 92103, United States, tjavidi@ucsd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Price<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many resource allocation schemes are known to suffer from incentive  compatibility issues when users hold private information and the  interests of users are not aligned with the interests of the system. We focus on an  alternate approach to pricing that exploits natural incidences of  two-commodity markets in realistic wireless networks - for example,  leveraging users?demand for downlink bandwidth to regulate their use of  uplink bandwidth.
