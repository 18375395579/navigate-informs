In this paper we focus on the role of boundary spanners and the influence processes they use convincing others in their home organizations that they have spotted an opportunity potential they have seen in a university setting, and that the potential opportunity should be pursued by the home organization. We specifically examine boundary spanners who are working with academics involved in research on nanotechnology.  Our exploratory work is based on semi-structured interviews with over 30 boundary spanners from a variety of organizations in a number of industries who have regular interactions with academics in National Nanoscience Centers.</br>
