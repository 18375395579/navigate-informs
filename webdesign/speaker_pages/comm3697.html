Title: Distilling Digital Traces: Images of Behavior in Online Communities<br>Author: Marc Smith, Senior Research Sociologist, Microsoft Research, Marc.smith@microsoft.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The behavior of authors and consumers of social media leave traces behind that are recorded in digital records and can, with processing, be visualized in a variety of ways.  These images support the study of social roles present in social media spaces, which is consequential for a more ecological conception of social media. The talk will feature examples of several visualization techniques that highlight varying roles and activities in newsgroups, email lists, web boards, and discussions.
