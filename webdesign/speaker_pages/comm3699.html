<br>Title: Large-scale Service Marketplaces: The Role of the Moderating Firm</br><br>Author: Eren Cil, Assistant Professor, University of Oregon, 1208 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, 97403-1208, United States of America, erencil@uoregon.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gad Allon, Achal Bassamboo</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we study the behavior of the agents and customers in a large-scale service marketplace. Our main goal is to discuss the role of the moderating firm in facilitating information gathering, operational efficiency, and communication among agents. Surprisingly, operational efficiency may be detrimental to the overall efficiency of the market-place. We show that to reap the gains of operational efficiency the firm may need to complement it by enabling communication among its agents.</br>
