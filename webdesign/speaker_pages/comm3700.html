Title: Scheduling and Control of Individuals in Service Environments<br>Author: John Goodale, University of Oregon, Lundquist College of Business, Eugene, OR, United States, jgoodale@LCBmail.uoregon.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper we consider the employee scheduling problem in service environments in which agents are unique.  We introduce a new scheduling model that accounts for individual characteristics and control.  We show that solutions to the new formulation are effective in allocating service capacity based on economic performance, and we provide insights into the scheduling issues in this environment.
