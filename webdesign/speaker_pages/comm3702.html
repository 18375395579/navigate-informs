<br>Title: Task Decomposition and Newsvendor Decision Making</br><br>Author: Enno Siemsen, Associate Professor, University of Minnesota, 3-150 Carlson School of Management, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, siems017@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yun Shin Lee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We separate order decisions into point forecasts, uncertainty judgments, and service level decisions in a behavioral laboratory experiment. Point forecasts are influenced by the underlying cost parameters. Uncertainty judgments are subject to overconfidence, and service level decisions suffer from a cognitive dissonance bias. In a set of additional experiments, we show that these biases can be mitigated by structuring and framing these judgments and decisions.</br>
