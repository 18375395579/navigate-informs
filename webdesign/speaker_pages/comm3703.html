Title: An Empirical Analysis of New Practice Implementation in Intensive Care Units<br>Author: Anita Tucker, Assistant Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 551 Huntsman Hall, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19066, United States, tuckera@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ingrid Nembhard, Amy Edmondson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate learning activities undertaken by improvement-project teams in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). To test our hypotheses, we surveyed 23 NICUs that implemented new practices. We find that a high level of supporting evidence for a unit’s portfolio of improvement projects was associated with implementation success. Learn-how activities were positively associated with implementation success. Psychological safety mediated the link between learn-how and implementation success.
