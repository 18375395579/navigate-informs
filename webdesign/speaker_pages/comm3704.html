Title: A Web-Based Decision Support System for Railroad Service Design<br>Author: Ravindra Ahuja, Professor, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, ahuja@ufl.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Railroad service design, which comprises developing a railroad's operating plan, has been one of the most challenging planning problems faced by US freight railroads and has been solved manually so far. We will describe and demonstrate a web-based interactive decision support system that enables a railroad to determine its operating plan within a week and incrementally change its current operating plan within days.
