Title: Effects of Learning and Cooperation on New Firm Marketing<br>Author: John Angelis, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, United States, john.angelis@case.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: New firms face liabilities of newness. These liabilities exist both in a firm’s marketing ability and in customer retention and acceptance. We investigate how a firm’s optimal marketing expenditures should change due to learning over time and the firm’s endogenous cooperation level with other firms.
