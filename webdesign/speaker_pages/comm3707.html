<br>Title: Capacity Management in a Cardiac Surgery Line</br><br>Author: Carter Price, AMSC Program, Department of Mathematics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, price@math.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Golden, Michael Harrington, Edward Wasil, Timothy Babineau, Bartley Griffith</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Capacity management is a key component to operating a hospital efficiently.  In this presentation, we discuss the use of simulation and machine learning in managing the throughput of a cardiac surgery line at a major urban hospital. Our models were developed in close cooperation with surgeons, nurses, and hospital management. We present results from an actual data set and discuss implementation issues.</br>
