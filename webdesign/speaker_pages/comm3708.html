Title: Staffing Service Systems with Load Dependent Service Rate<br>Author: Jing Dong, Columbia University, 500 W 120 Street Room 313, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, jd2736@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pnina Feldman, Galit Yom-Tov<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Empirical evidence suggests that the service time and the load of the system are correlated in many service systems. Load-related speedup by itself will not worsen performance, while slowdown may decrease customer service level and increase agents' workload dramatically. Hence, we concentrate on the latter, and examine how such dependence affects the operational performance through a modified Erlang-A model. We also propose methods that help stabilize and improve system performance.
