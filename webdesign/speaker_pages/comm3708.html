Load-related speedup by itself will not worsen performance, while slowdown may decrease customer service level and increase agents' workload dramatically. Hence, we concentrate on the latter, and examine how such dependence affects the operational performance through a modified Erlang-A model. We also propose methods that help stabilize and improve system performance.</br>
