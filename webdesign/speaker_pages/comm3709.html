The new paradigm of software development, open source, represents a system that allows flow of resources across clusters. With the advent of open source the formerly isolated clusters have become more massively connected networks. In this study, I find evidence that the networks that possess small world properties, high clustering and short average path length, are conducive for software development.</br>
