Title: An MCDA Approach to Synthetic Route Selection<br>Author: James Felli, Research Fellow, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, United States of America, felli_james_c@lilly.com<br>Coauthor(s): Peter G. Houghton, Douglas P. Kjell<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: During the early stages of pharmaceutical process development, development teams need to make synthesis process selections quickly in order to meet demand for clinical trial materials.  We will present an MCDA tool we developed to help chemists organize, present and differentiate among key criteria to select a synthetic route to a new active pharmaceutical ingredient.
