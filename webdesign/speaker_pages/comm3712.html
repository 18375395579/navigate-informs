Title: Inventory of Cash-constrained Firms and the Option to Acquire Future Financing<br>Author: Pierre-Yves Brunet, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., IOE 2811, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, brunetp@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Volodymyr Babich<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Trade credit financing allows cash-constrained firms to implement optimal operational decisions and signal their credit quality to banks and other lenders. Using a stochastic  dynamic programming model we first study joint inventory and financing decisions of a firm and then compute the signaling value of trade credit financing.  In this talk, we highlight the effects of financing constraints on inventory decisions and consequences of trade credit signals.
