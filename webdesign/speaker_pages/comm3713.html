Title: Improved Assessment of Solution Quality Applied to Sequential Sampling in Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Rebecca Stockbridge, Wayne State University, 1150 Faculty/Administration, 656 W. Kirby, Detroit, MI, 48202, United States of America, rebecca.stockbridge@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Guzin Bayraksan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a computational study of bias and variance reduction methods applied to optimality gap estimators. Techniques discussed include Latin Hypercube sampling, antithetic variates, and a probability metrics approach to bias reduction. We discuss the results of applying these methods to sequential sampling algorithms.
