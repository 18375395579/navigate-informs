Kirby, Detroit, MI, 48202, United States of America, rebecca.stockbridge@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guzin Bayraksan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a computational study of bias and variance reduction methods applied to optimality gap estimators. Techniques discussed include Latin Hypercube sampling, antithetic variates, and a probability metrics approach to bias reduction. We discuss the results of applying these methods to sequential sampling algorithms.</br>
