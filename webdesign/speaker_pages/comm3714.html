Management, Portland, OR, 97207, United States of America, jettera@cecs.pdx.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In the early planning stages of a new product, decision-makers need to make sense of a multitude of mainly qualitative, uncertain and oftentimes contradicting information about future business environments. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are a powerful means to elicit qualitative expert knowledge, to translate it into quantitative models of business scenarios, and to learn about interdependencies and dynamic properties of the business environment.
