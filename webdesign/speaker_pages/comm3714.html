<br>Title: Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for Decision Making and Learning in New Product Development Teams</br><br>Author: Antonie Jetter, Assistant Professor, Portland State University, PO Box 751, Eng. & Tech. Management, Portland, OR, 97207, United States of America, jettera@cecs.pdx.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In the early planning stages of a new product, decision-makers need to make sense of a multitude of mainly qualitative, uncertain and oftentimes contradicting information about future business environments. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are a powerful means to elicit qualitative expert knowledge, to translate it into quantitative models of business scenarios, and to learn about interdependencies and dynamic properties of the business environment.</br>
