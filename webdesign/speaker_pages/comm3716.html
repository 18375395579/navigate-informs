Title: Green Renewal: The Role of Technology and Sustainability in Equipment Replacement Decisions<br>Author: Thomas Sloan, Professor, UMass Lowell, College of Management, One University Avenue, Lowell, MA, 01854, United States of America, Thomas_Sloan@uml.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Traditional equipment replacement models assume like-for-like replacement and focus only on cost measures.  How can factors related to sustainability be incorporated into replacement decisions?  And how do technological advances play a role?  An MDP model of a single-machine replacement problem is developed to explore these questions, with particular emphasis on the policy/regulatory aspects of the decision.
