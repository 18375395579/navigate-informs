<br>Title: Optimal Reserve Selection Subject to Contiguous Habitat Requirements</br><br>Author: Sandor Toth, College of Forest Resources, University of Washington, Box 352100, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, toths@u.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Adam Skibbe, Robert Haight, Stephanie Snyder, Mark Gregory, James Miller</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Conservation efforts often require site selection strategies that lead to spatially cohesive reserves. Although habitat contiguity is thought to be conducive to the reproductive success of many threatened species, availability of funding and suitable land may restrict the extent to which this spatial attribute can be pursued in reserve design. Using optimization, we explore the economic and spatial tradeoffs of retaining grassland habitat in contiguous patches near the Chicago metropolitan area.</br>
