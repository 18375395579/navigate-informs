<br>Title: Optimal Investment in Late Stage New Drug Development</br><br>Author: Zhili Tian, Assistant professor, Towson University, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD, 21252, United States of America, zhili.a.tian@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Firms conduct Phase 3 drug trials by enrolling and treating patients that meet a set of conditions. Finding the patients is expensive and time consuming, with uncertainty around these. We determine the optimal investment policy. This must be done recognizing that there is uncertainty in the outcome of a trial. As trial duration increases, the patent protection period decreases, leading to lowered returns. We develop analytic results and provide conditions for accelerating or suspending a trial.</br>
