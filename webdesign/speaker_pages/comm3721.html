<br>Title: Stability and Instability of Interbank-lending System</br><br>Author: Tomoyuki Ichiba, University of California, South Hall 5617 A, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, United States of America, ichiba@pstat.ucsb.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study an interacting diffusion for a competitive interbank lending market where banks extend loans to one another at the interbank short-term rate, in addition to their long-term banking activities. Insufficient transaction in the interbank market triggers multiple defaults and then a financial instability. In our model the lending preferences are linked to the instability of system. We also discuss the role of a financial regulator who enhances the stability of the system under such model.</br>
