Title: Simulation-based Commissioning of Shop Floor Control Systems<br>Author: Jeff Smith, Professor, Auburn University, 207 Dunstan Hall, Auburn University, AL, 36849, United States, jsmith@auburn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Younchol Cho<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Commissioning involves proving/demonstrating that a control system works as designed, and contracted.  For complex shop floor control systems, commissioning is a time-consuming and expensive process.  However, the commissioning process is critical from the contractual, performance, and safety points of view.  This presentation presents an example of applying discrete event simulation to the shop floor control system commissioning process.
