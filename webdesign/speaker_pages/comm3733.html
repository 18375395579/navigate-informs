Title: Complexity as a Contract Design Factor: A Human-to-human Experimental Study<br>Author: Feryal Erhun, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, ferhun@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Basak Kalkanci, Kay-Yut Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Our goal is to identify why simpler contracts may be preferred in practice despite being theoretically suboptimal using a human supplier-human buyer (H2H) experimental setting. We extend Kalkanci, Chen, and Erhun’s (2011) (KCE) human supplier-computerized buyer results and show H2H interactions strengthen suppliers?preference for simpler contracts. KCE identified reinforcement and bounded rationality as key decision biases. In H2H experiments, we find evidence for social preference effects.
