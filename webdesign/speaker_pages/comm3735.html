<br>Title: Liquidity Impact of a Ban on Naked Credit-default Swaps</br><br>Author: Agostino Capponi, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 315 North Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, capponi@purdue.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a dynamic search model to study the impact on market liquidity and credit risk of banning naked credit default swap (CDS) positions.  In equilibrium, investors trade bonds and CDS protection directly and on over-the-counter markets (OTC). When OTC markets are well functioning, banning naked CDS positions raises market illiquidity and does not necessarily lower credit spreads. Bid-ask spreads increase proportionally to the benefits derived from using CDS as proxy hedging instruments. Such findings suggests that regulators should consider other measures to reduce instability from excessive speculation in derivatives market.</br>
