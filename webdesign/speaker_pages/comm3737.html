Title: Learning Gene Regulatory Modules Through Integrated Biclustering of Systems Biology Data<br>Author: David Reiss, Sr. Scientist, Institute for Systems Biology, 1441 North 34th Street, Seattle, WA, 98103-8904, United States of America, dreiss@systemsbiology.org<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Bonneau, Vesteinn Thorsson, Nitin Baliga<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Learning regulatory networks from expression data is an under-constrained problem that is aided by pre-identifying groups of putatively co-regulated genes (regulons). Recently, biclustering has been shown to be appropriate for this problem. Co-regulated genes are often functionally related and contain common DNA sequence motifs. I will describe cMonkey, an algorithm which identifies regulons by integrating biclustering of mRNA data with associations and the de novo detection of DNA motifs.
