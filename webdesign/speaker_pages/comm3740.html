Title: Optimism Over Time<br>Author: Cade Massey, Yale University, cade.massey@yale.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many studies indicate people hold positive illusions about themselves, but few suggest how these illusions persist over time. We suggest this is due in part to the future being imperfectly correlated with the past, and to people being self-serving in their perception of that correlation. We find that people believe processes are more stable when they’ve performed well, and more unstable when they’ve performed poorly, and that this bias facilitates the persistence of optimistic expectations.
