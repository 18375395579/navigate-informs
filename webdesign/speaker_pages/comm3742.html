From FY 2012 CMS has established a penalization factor in the IPPS for those hospitals that have higher rates of readmissions for three diseases. This work aims to study a new option from the health intervention approach that could help in the long run to develop a more sustainable improvement in the performance of the healthcare system.</br>
