Title: Hypermarket Service Quality with a Chinese Flavour<br>Author: James Stanworth, Assistant Professor, National Changhua University of Education, No. 2 Shi Da Road, Changhua, Taiwan - ROC, jamesstanworth@btinternet.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Few have studied customer perceptions of hypermarkets and almost none the determinants of (dis)satisfying encounters for Chinese customers. In this study Chinese customers of hypermarkets were surveyed and the findings reveal 18 determinants with 34 sub-determinants of (dis)satisfaction. Three broad groups emerged that were labelled as developers, terminators and influencers in their potential to nurture, hinder and facilitate (respectively) a Chinese Confucian notion of relationship.
