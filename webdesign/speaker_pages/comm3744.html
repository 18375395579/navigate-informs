We will demonstrate a new server-based version of the MPL OptiMax Component Library, that makes implementing real-world optimization applications a relatively quick and easy process. We will take you through all the steps of implementing optimization projects, including formulating the model, integrating it seamlessly with data in different formats, and then finally deploying the project on a server for servicing both web and mobile clients, using standard programming languages, such as CSharp, Visual Basic, C/C++, or Python.</br>
