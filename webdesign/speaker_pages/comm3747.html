<br>Title: Panel: Meeting the Challenges of Solver Independence</br><br>Author: Lou Hafer, Simon Fraser University, Computing Science, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada, lou@cs.sfu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kipp Martin, Steven Dirkse, Ted Ralphs</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The panelists will draw on their 80 years of collective experience using and implementing optimisation software to provide an informative and spirited discussion of the right way to do it, the wrong way to do it, the small pleasures, and the petty annoyances of writing solver-independent software. From efficient creation of call-back functions for Hessian calculation to suppressing unwanted output, we have opinions, and we're not afraid to use them!</br>
