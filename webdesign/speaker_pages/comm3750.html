Title: Deriving Supply Chain Metrics from Financial Statements<br>Author: Robert Bray, Assistant Professor, Kellogg/Northwestern, 311 Sheridan Ave, Palo Alto, CA, 94306, United States of America, robertlbray@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Haim Mendelson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop an empirical supply chain model that enables empiricists to derive operational metrics from demand signal processing how demand information flows through supply chains and perform corresponding counterfactuals. The metrics illuminate previously-obscure supply chain aspects, and the counterfactuals permit related what if studies. We demonstrate our methodology with six studies and firm-level Compustat data.
