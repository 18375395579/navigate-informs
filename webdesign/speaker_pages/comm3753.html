Title: Improving DEA Efficiency under Multiple Perspectives by Game Theory<br>Author: Xiaopeng Yang, University of Toronto, Centre for Management of Technology, Toronto, Canada, xiaopeng.yang@utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Paradi, Hiroshi Morita<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In the current research, each perspective stands for a classification of input/output for the attributes of DMU. Different perspectives have distinctive preferences even for the same attribute of DMU. In order to improve the DEA efficiency of a DMU under such a conflictive circumstance, we propose a new calculation method using game theory. A numerical case study of banking systems is also given to show the calculation results of our approach.
