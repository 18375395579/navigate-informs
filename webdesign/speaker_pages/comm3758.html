<br>Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Differences in Crowd-funder Contribution Decisions</br><br>Author: Gordon Burtch, Temple University, 1810 N 13th Street, Speakman Hall 201F, Philadelphia, PA, 19122, United States of America, gburtch@temple.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anindya Ghose, Sunil Wattal</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Contrary to Thomas Friedman’s Flat World hypothesis, here, we argue that the world is by no means flat, as distance continues to exist along dimensions other than the physical. Many online marketplaces today offer participants the opportunity to engage in economic exchange with others the world over. As a result, the differences between parties are often striking. Bearing this in mind, we explore the impact of cultural differences on lending on the world’s largest micro-finance website, Kiva.org. Leveraging an aggregate dataset of country-to-country lending, incorporating three million lending actions over a five-year period, we find that cultural differences are negatively associated with lending and, interestingly, that this association is decreasing in physical distance (we interpret this as an awareness effect). We consider the implications of this finding for the purveyors of globalized online marketplaces, making recommendations regarding information presentation and the application of institutional trust mechanisms.</br>
