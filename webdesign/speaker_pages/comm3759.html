Title: Translating Chem-bio Effects on Airports into Theater-level Impacts<br>Author: Phil Collins, Senior Scientist, BBN Technologies, 1337 Park Plaze, Suite 3, O’Fallon, IL, United States of America, pcollins@bbn.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Tustin, Dan Hazen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A Chem-Bio attack on a theater aerial port of debarkation (APOD) has far-reaching impacts on theater operations, including capability loss from contamination, anti-access and higher reliance on transload operations, which hurt the warfight.  Previous attempts to model these impacts were confined to reducing the Maximum-on-Ground or degrading the APOD throughput.  We show a capability to accurately model port-level throughput degrades and higher order effects on the theater.
