The unique dataset details information for 1,337 individual plants for the period 2001?009. Reduced form regressions provide evidence of real options effects for shutdown and abandonment decisions. Moreover, uncertainty about the outcome of ongoing deregulation in retail electricity markets significantly decreases the likelihood of shutting down operating plants.</br>
