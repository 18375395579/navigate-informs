Title: Near-optimal Execution Policies for Demand Response Contracts<br>Author: Vineet Goyal, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, vgoyal@ieor.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Garud Iyengar, Rhea Qiu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Demand-response (DR) contracts are an important instrument in managing supply-demand imbalances in the current electricity market. We present a data driven algorithm that computes a near-optimal execution policy for Demand-Response contracts under capacity constraints. Our algorithm is based on the sample average approximation method and we also provide sample complexity bounds.
