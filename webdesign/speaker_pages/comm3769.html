This alternative reduces mortality among the very young and old more than vaccinating them. Insofar as anti-viral medications also prevent infection or reduce the duration or magnitude of infectiousness, early treatment of ill schoolchildren would be most efficient, mitigating the evolution of resistance.</br>
