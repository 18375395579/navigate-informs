Title: Strategic Resource Planning for a Population with Mental Health and Addiction  Issues<br>Author: Martin Puterman, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, Canada, Martin.Puterman@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Greg Werker, Michael Krausz<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The number of people living with complex concurrent disorders ?including mental health and addiction issues ?in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside is staggering.  Myriad organizations provide healthcare and other services, yet no high-level quantitative strategic approach exists to model the entire system.  We use queueing theory to study how clients flow through services.  Our model can inform procedural and policy changes in order to better allocate resources to existing and new programs.
