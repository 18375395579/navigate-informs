Title: A System Dynamics Framework for Smart Grid Supply Chain Disruption<br>Author: Shokoufeh Mirzaei, Assistant Professor, California State Polytechnic University, 3801 W Temple Ave, Pomona, CA, 91768, United States of America, smirzaei@csupomona.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of smart grid supply chain and its potential disruption scenarios. First, major components of smart grid supply chain are identified. Then, a model-based system dynamics framework is developed and the potential risk factors and their associated risks are identified. The framework will enable managers to track the impact of the risk factor in the system and to build proactive and reactive strategies.
