Title: Developing a Dynamic Emergency Response Plan for a Post-earthquake Scenario<br>Author: Shuva Ghosh, Doctoral Candidate, Missouri University of Science and Technology, 223 Engineering Management Building, Rolla, MO, United States of America, sg2mb@mst.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abhijit Gosavi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: An effective emergency response plan can play a vital role in minimizing risk to the people affected when an earthquake strikes. Emergency resources are generally stored in multiple responding centers. Emergency management personnel have to select an optimal combination of responding centers to respond effectively in a dynamically evolving situation. In this work, we integrate inputs from a so-called domino-effect analysis within a semi-Markov decision process to develop a response plan.
