Title: Performance Obstacles in Intensive Care Units<br>Author: Ayse Pinar Gurses, agurs001@umaryland.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pascale Carayon<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigated the impact of performance obstacles on workload, quality of working life (QWL) and quality of care in ICUs. A cross-sectional, survey study was conducted among 300 nurses from 17 ICUs. Obstacles (e.g., misplaced charts, inadequate information) were significantly related to higher workload, lower QWL and quality of care. High workload increased stress and tension of ICU nurses and had a negative impact on quality of care. Findings have implications for ICU redesign efforts.
