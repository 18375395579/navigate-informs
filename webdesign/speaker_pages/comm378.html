<br>Title: Modeling Supply Chain System Structure to Trace Sources of Food Contamination</br><br>Author: Abigail L Horn, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, abbyhorn@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research aims to facilitate faster, more accurate tracing of sources of contaminated food during large-scale outbreak investigations. We analytically model stylized versions of the problem of traceback on food supply chain network structures to derive exact theoretical results that lead to new, general insights. We then develop implementable algorithms that identify the highest probability source of contamination in the most efficient manner given realistic limitations on data availability.</br>
