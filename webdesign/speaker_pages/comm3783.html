After analyzing the role that information technology plays in globalizing information-intensive services, the paper reviews a wide range of illustrative examples where information-intensive services have been globalized.  Based on this analysis, the paper proposes a theoretical framework that identifies the criteria and guidelines for successfully selecting service activities to be globalized and for choosing the appropriate country location.</br>
