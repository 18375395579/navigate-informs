<br>Title: A Market Design Approach to the Adoption of Children in Pennsylvania</br><br>Author: Mustafa Akan, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, Carnegie Mellon University, United States of America, akan@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Onur Kesten, Utku Unver</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Adoption is an important phenomenon in the U.S. Notwithstanding the growing demand and prominence of the issue, little is known about what assignment protocol needs to be employed by agencies. Inspired by our ongoing collaboration with Pennsylvania's Statewide Adoption Network, we study the incentives in child adoption through the lens of operations and economics, and make recommendations for alternative systems that can ameliorate the deficiencies of current assignment plans.</br>
