Hall, Zhixin Liu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the implications of environmental regulations on project scheduling. We model the decisions of a regulator and multiple project managers (PMs) as a Stackelberg game. The regulator specifies pollution remediation requirements, and the PMs respond either by remediation or by investment in greenness. We describe a subsidy for investment in greenness that coordinates the decisions of the players, and a bonus that ensures truth telling by PMs about their remediation costs.</br>
