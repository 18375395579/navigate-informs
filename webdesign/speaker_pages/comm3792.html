Title: Dynamic Monitoring of Chronic Disease<br>Author: Jonathan Helm, Assistant Professor, Indiana University, Kelley School of Business, ODT, 1309 East Tenth Street, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, jhelm@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gregg Schell<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This research develops new methods for dynamically monitoring chronic disease to allow better detection of disease worsening with fewer tests. We developed a prototype and tested it on a major clinical trial with results that significantly outperform current practice. Our team, including engineers, a clinician, and an epidemiologist, is working toward integrating our algorithms into widely used glaucoma testing machines.
