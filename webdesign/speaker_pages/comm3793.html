<br>Title: Why Don't We Live in a Modular World?</br><br>Author: Sezer Ulku, Assistant Professor, Georgetown University McDonough School of Business, Washington, DC, 20057, United States, SU8@georgetown.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Glen Schmidt</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: To deal with uncertainty and technological change, the prescription is often to use modular product architectures. However, the evolution of products in the electronics market sometimes tells a different story. For instance, Handspring had conceived a modular platform that would accomomdate new applications through an expansion port. But more recent versions have adopted a more integral architecture that does not allow expansion. We seek to explain anomalies such as this.</br>
