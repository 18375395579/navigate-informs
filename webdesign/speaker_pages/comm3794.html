Title: Identity and Opinion: A Randomized Experiment<br>Author: Sean Taylor, New York University, 44 West 4th Street, New York, NY, United States of America, staylor@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sinan Aral, Lev Muchnik<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Social media content such as tweets and comments are usually displayed with the identity of the user who creates them. The associated social context links content quality and creator identity, making it difficult to separate their effects on content interactions such as rating and discourse. We conducted a randomized experiment on a news discussion website, randomly omitting commenter identity for 5% of comments and allowing us to attribute interactions to identity features only.
