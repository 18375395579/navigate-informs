Title: Severe Weather and Automobile Assembly Productivity<br>Author: Marcelo Olivares, Columbia Business School/ Universidad de Chile, Republica 701, Santiago, Chile, mo2338@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gerard Cachon, Santiago Gallino<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Using panel data on weekly production of US assembly plants over a period of 10 years, we estimate the impact of severe weather on the productivity of these plants. We find that severe weather can add substantial variability to the production of new vehicles. Using our estimates, we project the potential impact of climate change over the next decades.
