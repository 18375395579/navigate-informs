Our work provides the optimal allocation of inbound trailers to docks at a crossdocking facility operated by Transfreight. We focus on improving the efficiency of operations as well as balancing workload among crossdock workers. Model implementation is performed using both a spreadsheet-based solver and CPLEX. The advantages/disadvantages of each option are discussed.</br>
