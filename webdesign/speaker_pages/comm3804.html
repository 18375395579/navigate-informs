<br>Title: Disaster Relief Assignment Problems: Including Conflict Between Communities and Relief Organizations</br><br>Author: Caity Bogdan, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, 219 Engineering Lab I, 160 Governor's Drive, Amherst, MA, 01002, United States of America, mapsbysirius@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jenna Marquard</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The allocation of disaster relief organizations to projects can be characterized as an assignment problem with several unique attributes. For instance, characteristics of relief organizations (race, gender, nationality, etc.) and disaster-struck communities may constrain organization-project assignments. We use existing literature and focus groups to explore the nature of these potential conflicts and propose how conflicts can be included in the construction of these assignment problems.</br>
