Existing thermally-aware job allocation policies do not consider the communication among the threads of an application while making decisions. However, performance of multi-threaded high performance computing (HPC) applications is strongly affected by the distances among the communicating nodes. This talk discusses a novel job allocation method to minimize the communication cost while also reducing the cooling energy.</br>
