Title: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Interventions during an Influenza Pandemic<br>Author: Anna Teytelman, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Operations Research Center, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, teytanna@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Larson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: With pandemic influenza, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical resources are limited. We present dynamic, multi-regional, vaccine allocation schemes for the USA.  For single communities with heterogeneous populations, we examine the effects of timing and targeting strategies on reaching herd immunity. We conclude with strategies for combining vaccines with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand-washing, public awareness campaigns and school closures to decrease intensity of an outbreak.
