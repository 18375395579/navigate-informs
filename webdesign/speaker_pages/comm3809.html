We present dynamic, multi-regional, vaccine allocation schemes for the USA.  For single communities with heterogeneous populations, we examine the effects of timing and targeting strategies on reaching herd immunity. We conclude with strategies for combining vaccines with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand-washing, public awareness campaigns and school closures to decrease intensity of an outbreak.</br>
