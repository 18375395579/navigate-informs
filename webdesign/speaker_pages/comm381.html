Title: Offshoring of Technology and Local Innovation Dynamics<br>Author: Brian Fifarek, PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, bfifarek@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Current research maintains that firm-level offshoring practices are beneficial to firms and national economies, but little is known about the long-term effect of offshoring on home economy innovation, especially at a regional or local level. We look at the rare earths industry to understand how offshoring practices have adverse effects on innovation at the regional and national levels.
