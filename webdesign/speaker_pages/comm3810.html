A Focus Group Study<br>Author: Yimin Liu, Marketing Analytics Supervisor, Ford Motor Company, One American Road, Dearborn, MI, 48126, United States of America, yliu59@ford.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The purpose of the focus group is to capture car drivers' attitudes towards technology in cars in general as well as their receptiveness to technology that would enable them to take surveys in their cars during driving using the Ford SYNC system. Appropriate incentives, right driving conditions and good timing/context could sway drivers into taking surveys in their cars. Safety is a major concern shared by participants towards technology use in car (including taking surveys).
