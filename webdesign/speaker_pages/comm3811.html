Title: Using Stochastic Simulation to Assess Operability and Availability of a Unique New Chemical Plant<br>Author: Prenitha Pooren, Sr Operations Researcher, Sasol Technology, 1 Klasie Havenga str, Sasolburg, 1947, South Africa, Prenitha.Pooren@sasol.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Sasol is constructing the world’s first commercial ethylene tetramerisation unit. Beneficial operation of the plant will be reached late 2013.  Being a new technology, questions regarding the sizing of the plant equipment, availability, operations and associated risks were raised. Simulation was identified as the best risk mitigation tool to provide answers. Behaviour of this complex integrated system was investigated and variance-based sensitivities were determined.
