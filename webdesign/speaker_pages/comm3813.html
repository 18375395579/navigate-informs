Title: Meso-Analysis Analysis of Six Sigma Projects and Resilience Modeling<br>Author: Jason Schenk, The Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Avenue, 210 Baker Systems, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States, schenk.32@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Brady, Theodore Allen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: 39 six sigma projects were performed at a Midwest manufacturer.  This paper describes attempts to mine data about the financial performance data of these projects to support decision-making about how the six sigma program should be run, i.e., meso-level decision support.  We also describe future research related to resilience modeling.
