Title: Operational Errors and Traffic Levels: A Challenge for NAS Growth<br>Author: Gerald Shapiro, CNA Corporation, Gerald.CTR.Shapiro@faa.gov<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: An operational error occurs when separation rules and procedures are not followed due to equipment or human error. Currently, operational errors are rare events; however, our analysis shows that the number operational errors increases faster than the growth in air traffic operations. We examine some implications, and the potential for automated tools to ameliorate the problem.
