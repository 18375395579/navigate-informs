Title: Mining Blog Data for Box Office Prediction<br>Author: Eric Zheng, Assistant Professor, UT Dallas, 3.203 SOM, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, 75083, United States, ericz@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Yue<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Sales of products such as movies are often influenced by customers' word of mouth (WOM). Blogs present a new venue to study this WOM effect because they represent consumers' opinions over time across the population. We mine this blog data to predict the box office of movies. A text mining method is proposed to capture online opinions including volume, valence, sentiment and disposition of a blog on a movie. Initial econometric analyses show that blog has a significant effect on box office.
