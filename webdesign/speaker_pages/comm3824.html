Blogs present a new venue to study this WOM effect because they represent consumers' opinions over time across the population. We mine this blog data to predict the box office of movies. A text mining method is proposed to capture online opinions including volume, valence, sentiment and disposition of a blog on a movie. Initial econometric analyses show that blog has a significant effect on box office.</br>
