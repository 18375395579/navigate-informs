Title: Digital Service Flexibility: Implications for Performance<br>Author: Terence Saldanha, Assistant Professor of Information Systems, Emporia State University, 1200 Commercial Street, Cremer Hall, Room 110, Emporia, KS, 66801, United States of America, tsaldanh@emporia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jiban Khuntia, Abhishek Kathuria<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate how digital service flexibility (DSF) influences performance of credit unions. We identify three dimensions of DSF: basic DSF, transaction DSF, customer DSF.  We theorize a complementary effect of transaction DSF, and negative moderation effect of customer DSF on the relationship between basic DSF and performance.  Using archival data collected from the annual reports of credit unions across the United States, we find empirical support for the hypothesized relationships.
