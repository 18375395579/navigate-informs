Title: On the Temporal Nature of Sales to Rank Relationships of Digital Music<br>Author: Ramnath Chellappa, Associate Professor, Emory University, 1300 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA, 30322, United States of America, ramnath.chellappa@emory.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A significant amount of work in IS, economics and marketing has used a sales-rank relationship to impute demand from the relative sales-rank of a product in its category.  However many industries, in particular the music industry are subject to temporal changes suggesting that the sales to rank relationship may not be fixed.  Analyses of weekly album-sales data not only reveals statistically different sales distribution week-to-week, but also significant differences in this relationship.
