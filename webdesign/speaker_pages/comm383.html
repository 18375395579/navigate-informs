Title: Assessing the Impact of New Vehicle Concepts in NextGen<br>Author: Michelle Kirby, Research Engineer II, ASDL/Georgia Tech, 270 Ferst Drive, Mail Stop 0150, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, Michelle.kirby@ae.gatech.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This presentation will focus on the impact of various new vehicle concepts within NextGen utilizing a physics based analysis being developed by the FAA called the Environmental Design Space,EDS. EDS can provide a capability to estimate source noise, exhaust emissions, performance, and operational parameters for future aircraft designs under different technological scenarios. The capability will allow for assessments of interdependencies and trade-offs that occur within the NextGen setting.
