Title: Resource Mobilizing in Constrained Environments: A Study of Technology Social Ventures<br>Author: Geoffrey Desa, University of Washington-Seattle, gdesa@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Suresh Kotha<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Non-profit and for-profit technology social ventures mobilize resources and create scalable social innovations despite a scarcity of funding and institutional support. We draw upon bricolage, an emerging perspective in entrepreneurship, which suggests that firms can intentionally make do with existing resources at hand. These resources include “junk?materials (e.g. technology, machinery, hardware and software), labor (e.g. volunteers, friends and family), and skills (e.g. volunteer knowledge of efficient processes or alternative technologies), and are often available for free or cheaply. Building upon a comparative case study and the resource mobilization literature, we develop propositions to explain how institutional factors and collective agency affect resource-mobilization, and in turn attract beneficiaries and customers to the venture. We test these propositions on a sample of 200 technology social ventures.
