Cole Smith, Professor, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, cole@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jane Ammons, Ronald Askin, Wedad Elmaghraby, Esra Buyuktahtakin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: I will discuss several habits that my colleagues and I use to make our experience as a professor more enjoyable, successful, and rewarding. The presentation will focus on how core principles drive good habits.  Because some good habits are, essentially, not falling into bad habits, I will discuss some common ones through cautionary tales (augmented by my own experience). The panel will solicit feedback and discussion in lieu of a long presentation.</br>
