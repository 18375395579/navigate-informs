Title: Dynamic Modeling of Human Decisions using Decision Field Theory<br>Author: Andres Abad, University of Michigan, Department of Industrial, and Operations Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, agabad@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Young-Jun Son, Judy Jin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This research aims to extend the decision field theory to model the dynamic characteristics of human decision processes. The inherent linkage between the statistical classifier design and the expected attention weights is at the first time investigated. An adaptive estimation of the expected attention weights is also presented based on sequentially observed human decisions.
