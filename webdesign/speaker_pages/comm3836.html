Title: Optimal Multiperiod Portfolios of Hydrocarbon Exploration and Production Projects under Uncertainty<br>Author: Leon Lasdon, University of Texas, Austin, TX, Leon.Lasdon@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Dyer, Wei Chen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We model a single project as a decision tree, and consider sets of projects linked by budget constraints.  Chance nodes model geologic uncertainties, while decision nodes include acquisition, exploration, and development stages.  We describe some realistic problem instances, and show their CPLEX behaviors when posed as MILP’s using GAMS.   Plans for future work are discussed.
