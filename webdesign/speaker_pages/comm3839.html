Title: Working with Cheats: The Role of Deception in Principal Agent Settings<br>Author: Sanjiv Erat, University of California at San Diego, serat@ucsd.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Many principal agent relationships involve information asymmetry of the effort that the agent exerts. While traditional economic theory predicts the sub-optimality of compensations based on unobservable efforts, actual practices, such as the use of billable hours, suggest that compensation mechanisms may be based on agent reported metrics.     In this presentation, I shall present evidence of two facets of lying aversion: the agent's aversion to lie, and the principal's aversion to be lied to.
