Title: Degeneracy in Flux Balanced Analysis<br>Author: Allen Holder, Trinity University, One Trinity Place, San Antonio, TX, United States of America, aholder@trinity.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Flux Balance Analysis provides a computational tool to understand a metabolic network under constant growth.  The underlying optimization model is commonly degenerate, something we explore mathematically and computationally. We further highlight the mapping between environment and growth by introducing a minimal environment.
