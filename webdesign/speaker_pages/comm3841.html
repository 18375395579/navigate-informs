Title: Operational Analysis Readiness, Availability and Logistics of a System with Modern Condition-Based Maintenance<br>Author: Donald Gaver, Distinguished Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, DGaver@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Patricia Jacobs, Ernest A. Seglie, Kevin Glazebrook<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Condition-Based Maintenance deters catastrophic failures (cfs) by reporting precursors/diagnostics (pds) in advanced real time (hence CBM+). Logistics demand and supply-chain load can thus be lightened and smoothed, and readiness improved. Our analysis invokes fragility-enhanced, or multiple-stochastic shock models for catastrophic failuress and prognostic/ddisagnostic failuress.
