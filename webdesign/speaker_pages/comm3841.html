Seglie, Kevin Glazebrook</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Condition-Based Maintenance deters catastrophic failures (cfs) by reporting precursors/diagnostics (pds) in advanced real time (hence CBM+). Logistics demand and supply-chain load can thus be lightened and smoothed, and readiness improved. Our analysis invokes fragility-enhanced, or multiple-stochastic shock models for catastrophic failuress and prognostic/ddisagnostic failuress.</br>
