Title: Forecast Accuracy Monitoring & Control Process: Call Center Applications<br>Author: Viroj Buraparate, Manager, Hewlett Packard Company, 20555 SH 249, Houston, TX, 77070, United States, Viroj.Buraparate@hp.com<br>Coauthor(s): Kristofer Johnson, David Olsen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The authors discuss how to integrate the call centers operations?requirements into the forecasting process.  By applying quality control techniques, the new forecasts can be statistically adjusted to react to the dynamics of the in-bound call volumes and operations' constraints. Methodology and examples will be given.
