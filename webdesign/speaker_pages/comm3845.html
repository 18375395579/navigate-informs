Title: An Approach to Approximating in-kind Donations Received by Food Banks through Supermarket Collection<br>Author: Luther Brock, Doctoral Candidate, North Carolina A&T State University, 1601 East Market Street, Greensboro, NC, 27411, United States of America, lgbrockiii@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Lauren Davis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of approximating the commodity-specific amount of in-kind food items received through an isolated food bank collection at supporting supermarkets.  An artificial neural network (ANN) is developed based on past collection records maintained for a food bank in the southeastern United States.  The accuracy of this ANN is compared to linear regression.  The impact of improved forecast accuracy on transportation costs is demonstrated.
