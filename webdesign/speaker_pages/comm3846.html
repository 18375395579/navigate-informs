Title: DA-MLAR-AXP: Directional Antenna Multi-Path Location Aided Routing with Adjustable X-Mission Power<br>Author: Sanjaya Gajurel, Graduate Student, Case Western Reserve University, 2463 Overlook Road, Apt #11, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, sxg125@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyun Kim, Limin Wang, Behnam Malakooti<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper presents an adjustable transmission power capability for our Directional Antenna Multi-path Location Aided Routing (DA-MLAR) and provides analysis of energy consumption of fixed and adjustable transmission power modes. Through simulations, we demonstrate that adjustable transmission power capability in DA-MLAR improves its packet delivery ratio by up to thirty percent.
