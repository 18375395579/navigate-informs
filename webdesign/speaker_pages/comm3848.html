<br>Title: Health Care Supply Chain for Behavioral Health: Evaluating Community Environment and Primary Care</br><br>Author: David Zepeda, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota, Minneaplis, MN, United States of America, zepe0003@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kingshuk K. Sinha</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: One in four people experience a behavioral health condition in their lifetime. Making treatment affordable and cost effective requires the integration of behavioral and physical care through primary care. Yet, the community environment can also influence behavioral health. Using clinic and community level data we evaluate the effects of the community environment (physical and social) and quality primary care (technology-enabled, evidence based, and affordable) on improving behavioral health.</br>
