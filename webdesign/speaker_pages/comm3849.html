<br>Title: Can Meritocracy Eliminate Workplace Discrimination?</br><br>Author: Justin Tumlinson, University of California, Berkeley, F405 Student Services Bldg. #1900, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, tumlinson@haas.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Meritocracy motivates employment discrimination law. A sorting model of production driven by worker ability with endogenous team formation shows, even when a manager apportions credit amongst team members proportional to expected relative contribution, statistical discrimination is sustainable in equilibrium. In this setting, discrimination can be socially optimal, victims produce better expected solo output than beneficiaries, and beneficiaries?credit increases more than victims?with synergy.</br>
