Title: Accounting for Equity in Infrastructure Maintenance<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas, Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Equity issues often arise in budget allocation, whether between rural and urban areas, or among specific districts or regions. Simply allocating projects in a geographically diverse area may not be enough, because the equity issue is based on the users who benefit, not the infrastructure itself. This presentation introduces several methods for incorporating equity constraints or metrics into maintenance optimization formulations, and provides initial discussion of their merits and limitations.
