Simply allocating projects in a geographically diverse area may not be enough, because the equity issue is based on the users who benefit, not the infrastructure itself. This presentation introduces several methods for incorporating equity constraints or metrics into maintenance optimization formulations, and provides initial discussion of their merits and limitations.</br>
