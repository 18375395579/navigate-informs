Title: A Monte Carlo Study of Uncertainty in Random Forest Scores<br>Author: Thomas Willemain, Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, willet@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Randall Dahlberg<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of the factors governing uncertainty in scores generated by random forest classifiers. Included is an assessment of bootstrap estimates of the standard errors of scores produced by random forests built on transactional databases. Implication for practice relate to determining sample sizes required for accurate estimates of scores and accounting for score uncertainty when developing lists of putative members of the interesting class.
