Title: Stability Yields a PTAS for k-Median and k-Means Clustering<br>Author: Pranjal Awasthi, CMU, 5000 Forbes avenue, pittsburgh, United States of America, pawasthi@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Avrim Blum, Or Sheffet<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a new notion of clustering stability under which one can design polynomial time approximation schemes for k-means and k-median clustering objectives. Our result improves upon previous work of   [Ostrovsky'06] and [Balcan, Blum, Gupta'09].
