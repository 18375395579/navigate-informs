Title: Information Acquisition in Competitive R&D Markets: Market Research Vs. Competitive Intelligence<br>Author: He Chen, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland College Park, 3330C Van Munching Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, hechen@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yi Xu, Manu Goyal<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Before key R&D decisions, firms often acquire information about important market characteristics. Two most common approaches are market research that collects information through customers, and competitive intelligence that focuses on competitors. We prove that competitive intelligence emerges endogenously, even when information through market research is free and generates higher value.
