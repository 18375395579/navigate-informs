<br>Title: A Stochastic Power Market Equilibrium with Risk-averse Investors</br><br>Author: Lin Fan, lfan@jhu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Catherine S. Norman, Benjamin F. Hobbs</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A simulation considers producers in a competitive market. Investment decisions are a two-stage equilibrium problem. Initially, investment is made under regulatory uncertainty; then the regulatory state is revealed and producer's returns realized. Under carbon emission regulation risk, risk-averse producers prefer less carbon-intensive investment. We then discuss implications for electricity modeling.</br>
