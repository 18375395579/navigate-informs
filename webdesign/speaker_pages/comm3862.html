Title: Retrieval of Simple and Informative Views of Complex Data<br>Author: Madalina Fiterau, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, 6105 Gates-Hillman Complex, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, mfiterau@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Artur Dubrawski<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Data driven analyses involving human interpretation benefit from models that are comprehensible as well as accurate. Consider a radiation threat detection system which leverages high dimensional measurements to determine if a truck carries radioactive cargo. Predictions on such data must be supported with intuitive explanations to allow border inspectors to make confident decisions. We present algorithms that produce informative views of data and support explainability of automated predictions.
