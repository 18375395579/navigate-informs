<br>Title: A Real Options Model for Regulatory Risk</br><br>Author: Matt Davison, Professor, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, mdavison@uwo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Maxwell</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The economic viability of Green energy projects may depend on subsidies or feed in tariffs.  Energy infrastructure is long lived and can allow  its operator  real options to store energy or to switch one form of energy into another.  Green energy developers are long options but short exposed to future unpredictable changes in subsidy levels.     We use a corn ethanol case study to  draw some public policy conclusions on the impact of these factors on green energy real options.</br>
