Title: Factors Here, Factors There, Interactions Everywhere!<br>Author: Susan Sanchez, Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Department, 1411 Cunningham Road, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, ssanchez@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Sanchez<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe a simple method for generating highly efficient, resolution-V fractional factorial and central composite designs. This is part of an ongoing effort to study simulations involving hundreds of input factors. Our portfolio of designs has yielded insights for a variety of defense and homeland security issues.
