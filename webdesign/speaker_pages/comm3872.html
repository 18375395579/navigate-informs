<br>Title: Operations Design to Enhance ARPA-E Funding for Transformational Clean Technology Start-ups</br><br>Author: Sinan Erzurumlu, Assistant Professor, Babson College, 231 Forest Park, Babson Park, MA, 02457, United States of America, serzurumlu@babson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jane Davies, Nitin Joglekar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the role of operations design in securing funding for highly risky projects. We use data from 36 transformational innovative clean technology projects to examine to what extent the operational decisions can mitigate risk and enhance firm valuation during clean technology start-up. We find that operations design for risk reduction induces more funding, but design for market competitiveness shows significant negative correlation to level of funding.</br>
