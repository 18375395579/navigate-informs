<br>Title: Preventing Retail Theft: A Test Routine Activity Theory</br><br>Author: Christopher Swanton, University of Minnesota, 321 19th Ave S, Suite 3-150, Minneapolis, MN, 55406, United States of America, swant006@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Manus Rungtusanatham, Kevin Linderman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Each year retailers lose billions of dollars to theft perpetrated by both shoppers and employees alike. Through cooperation with a Fortune 100 retailer, we secured a combination of perceptual primary data and objective secondary data describing store-level shrink for over 1,000 retail outlets. We use the tenets of Routine Activity Theory to investigate the efficacy of securitization initiatives on retail theft prevention.</br>
