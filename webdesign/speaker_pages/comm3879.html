In this 15 month ethnography, I track the process of change in response to a reform involving surgical practices in two surgical teaching hospitals.  In one of the hospitals, organization members accomplished a real change in practices.  The change seems to have required, however, more than the actions of powerful top managers or middle status paraprofessionals, as current literature would suggest.  Instead, real change in practices was accomplished via the mobilization of a cross-rank coalition. Members with non-traditionalist identities transformed themselves from a disorganized group of individuals into an organized cross rank coalition via interactions in everyday work encounters and used this cross-rank coalition to create pressure for change.  The agentic processes which were critical to the change were 1) the building of a cross-rank reformer identity, frames and solidarity across ranks, 2) the use of the reformer identity and frames to marshal resources from top managers, 3) the pressuring of traditionalists via crisis, and 4) the cross-rank creation of a positive model for change.</br>
