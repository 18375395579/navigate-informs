Title: Differential Impacts of Information Technology on Managing Organizational Risk<br>Author: Nirup Menon, Assistant Professor, University of Texas Dallas, menon@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rajiv Kohli, Asunur Cesar<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examined the effect of transactional, administrative, and clinical IT on organization risk. Organizational risk considered are the ability to take risk (length of stay of patients), the outsourced risk (malpractice insurance taken), and the realized risk (ratio of expected to actual mortality rate, and ratio of expected to actual complication rate). Using data from 47 hospitals from 1998 to 2001, we found that IT has differential impacts on organizational risk.
