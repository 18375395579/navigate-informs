<br>Title: Nanostructure Growth Modeling for in Situ Nanomanufacturing Process Control</br><br>Author: Qiang Huang, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Ave., ENB118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, huangq@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Tremendous efforts have been devoted to basic nanoscience discovery, novel processes development, and concept proof of nanoscale devices. Yet much less research work has been undertaken in nanomanufacturing to improve process repeatability. Quality control of nanomanufacturing processes faces new challenges of scale effects. This talk presents a nanostructure growth modeling strategy for in situ process control.</br>
