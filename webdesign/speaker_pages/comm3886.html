Title: A Multi-agent Framework for Collaborative Airlift Planning using Commercial Air Assets<br>Author: Greg Godfrey, Senior Manager, Metron, Inc., 11911 Freedom Drive, Suite 800, Reston, VA, 20190, United States of America, godfrey@metsci.com<br>Coauthor(s): Aren Knutsen, Tom Mifflin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Air Mobility Command (AMC) uses commercial air assets from the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) to support strategic airlift. However, CRAF is a voluntary program and the support is expensive and disruptive for the carriers. We investigate a market-based approach, called the Virtual Transportation Company (VTC), that uses autonomous software agents representing the interests of each party to plan the airlift collaboratively.
