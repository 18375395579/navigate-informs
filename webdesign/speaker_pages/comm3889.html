Title: On the Use of Profile Monitoring for Qality Control of Geometrical Product Specifications<br>Author: Bianca Colosimo, Dipartimento di Meccanica, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, biancamaria.colosimo@polimi.it<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Quality of machined items is usually related to both dimensional and geometrical specifications. Traditional control charting focuses on dimensional quality characteristics, while resulting inefficient when geometrical features have to be monitored as well. Recent approaches for profile monitoring represent a viable and effective solution for quality control of geometrical specifications.
