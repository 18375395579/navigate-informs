Title: Analyzing the Impact of Government Participation on the U.S. Healthcare Financing System<br>Author: Zhen Zhu, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, zzhu@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Liu, Nan Kong<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In healthcare financing, over-utilization and insurance overhead are two major structural costs that do not contribute to well-being. We consider a mechanism design problem, for which we formulate as a leader-follower game. The government is the leader who intends to minimize the total structure cost, and the representative private insurer is the follower who intends to maximize its profit. Three mechanisms are studied and numerical analysis is conducted based on the RAND HIE data.
