<br>Title: Healthcare Associated Infections: An Agent-based Simulation of the Dynamics of Pathogen Flows</br><br>Author: Reidar Hagtvedt, Assistant Professor, University of Alberta School of Business, 3-23 Business Building, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R6, Canada, hagtvedt@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gregory Todd Jones, Paul Griffin, Pinar Keskinocak</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) are an increasing concern the world over, especially as resistant pathogens multiply. The economics of regulation of HAIs and the dynamics of pathogen flows may be analyzed in a system of interdependent agents, e.g. as a collective goods problem. We generalize previous studies on pathogen flows in individual units to an agent-based simulation on a social network, and in particular, consider emergent properties and policy.</br>
