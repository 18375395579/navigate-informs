Title: A POMDP Approach for Imputing Rewards to Time-dependent Breast Cancer Screening Policies<br>Author: Kuang-Hao Buch, North Carolina State University, 400 Daniels Hall, 111 Lampe Drive, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, kyeh@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Wilson, Julie S. Ivy<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This research seeks to improve the understanding of the costs of a recommended breast cancer screening policy. When evaluating screening policies, the involved costs are difficult to quantify and justify.This study develops an inverse algorithm applied to a POMDP-based model for breast cancer screening policies. Our study identifies the implied costs, measured in mortality rates. This study explores the relationship among the implied mortality rates associated with different screening policies.
