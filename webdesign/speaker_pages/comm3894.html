<br>Title: Optimal Energy Technology Portfolio in the Face of Climate Change</br><br>Author: Olaitan Olaleye, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Room 120A, Marston Hall, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, natialol@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Senay Solak, Erin Baker</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We use a multi-model framework to evaluate the effect of advancement in an energy technology portfolio including Solar, Nuclear, CCS, Bio-energy and Batteries for transportation. We find that CCS complements electricity from biomass, while most of the other technology pairs are substitutes; Nuclear projects have a large impact on near term abatement cost and portfolios without CCS have difficulty reaching full abatement. We discuss how the optimal R&D portfolio changes at different budget levels.</br>
