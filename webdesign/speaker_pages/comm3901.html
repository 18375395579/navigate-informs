Title: A Case Study on Offshore Remanufacturing<br>Author: Joao Quariguasi, Drs., Rotterndam School of Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands, jquariguasi@rsm.nl<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: One of the largest dutch OEM has recently decided to relocate parts of its re-manufacturing activities to the far East. There are a number of advantages in off-shoring remanufacturing ,i.e. labor costs are reduced. There are, however, a number of foreseen drawbacks as well, i.e. reduction of control over the remanufacturing processes.  We intend here to present the initial results of our case research, with respect to the main threats and opportunities facing offshore remanufacturing.
