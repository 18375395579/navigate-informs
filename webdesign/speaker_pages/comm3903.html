Title: Routing for Customer Relationship<br>Author: Shu Zhang, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America, shu-zhang-1@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey W. Ohlmann, Barrett W. Thomas<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This problem is motivated by the decision making that salespeople face in their daily work. We focus on a priori routing of representatives in health care industry such that the expected sales to doctors can be maximized. We investigate a series of formulations with increasing modeling detail of the stochastic elements. Our computational experiments identify the value of modeling stochasticity.
