Title: Robustness of Sequential Test for Comparative Assessment of Service Process Efficacy<br>Author: Yefim Haim Michlin, Senior researcher, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Faculty of Industrial Engineering & Mana, Haifa, 32000, Israel, yefim@technion.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Genady Ya. Grabarnik, Ofer Shaham, Laura Shwartz<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We construct a binomial SPR test to assess the efficacy of a service team under assumption that the processing time (or TBE) of the customer requests is exponentially distributed. We study the effect of deviation of the TBE from the exponential distribution on the test characteristics. It is shown that for distributions with a coefficient of variation <1, the characteristic of the test is significantly improved.
