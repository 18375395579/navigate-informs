<br>Title: Computational and Analytical Challenges and Opportunities in Personalized Medicine</br><br>Author: George Poste, Chief Scientist, Arizona State University, AZ, United States of America</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Rapid progress in systems biology and molecular analytical platforms offers the promise of major gains in the detection, treatment and prevention of diseases and for targeting therapeutic interventions to match the molecular and pharmacogenetic profiles of individual patients (personalized medicine).   Whole genome sequencing and other molecular diagnostics, next-generation body imaging and miniaturized on body: in-body sensors will assume increasing importance in the healthcare value chain as powerful platforms for precision diagnosis, selection of optimum treatment, treatment compliance and remote monitoring of individual health status.  Agility in forging new alliances between the hitherto separate sectors of (bio) pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, devices, computing, telecommunications and consumer social media networks will radically reshape the future healthcare landscape and the competitive environment. These accelerating trends will generate data on an unprecedented scale.  Academia, industry, regulators and healthcare systems are ill-prepared for the technical, infrastructure, financial, organizational and cultural implications of ‘big data?and large scale computing initiatives in healthcare.   Technical innovation has been, and will remain, fundamental to progress in healthcare. However, the acceleration of new discoveries and convergence of hitherto separate research disciplines and industrial sectors  will generate complex economic, social and ethical questions regarding the 'value' of innovation, how much new technology society can afford and how priorities for the allocation of expensive healthcare resources are set.</br>
