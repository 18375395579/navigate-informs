<br>Title: Emergent Innovation as a Ratcheting Process that Accumulates Positive Deviations</br><br>Author: James Hazy, Associate Professor, Adelphi University, 1 South Avenue, Garden City, NY, United States of America, hazy@adelphi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tom Shinick</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Inventions can be observed as assignable deviations from the norm with positive though unrealized potential. Innovation recognizes, captures, and preserves inventions in a ratcheting process. By accumulating inventions, it evolves what is seen as normal activity in a positive direction with regards fitness. At each click of the ratchet, new information about what works is embedded in the system, events becomes more predictable, and additional recombination potentialities are created.</br>
