Title: Skills Recommendations in Online Labor Markets<br>Author: Marios Kokkodis, PhD Student, New York University, Stern School of Business, New York, NY, United States of America, mkokkodi@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panagiotis Ipeirotis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In online labor markets employers make decisions based on workers?reputations and skillsets; in this work we focus on workers?skillsets. We assume that a stream of jobs that require a specific skillset has a utility that is a function of the volume of these jobs, their hiring probability and their average wage. By assuming that the market is in equilibrium we estimate the opportunity cost of learning a new skill and present an approach to strategically recommend the acquisition of new skills.
