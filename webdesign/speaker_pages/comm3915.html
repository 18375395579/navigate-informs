Title: Intra-firm Networks of Industrial Units: Acquisitions and the Impact of Proximity and Similarity<br>Author: Santiago Mingo, Harvard University, Wyss House, 24 Harvard Way, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, smingo@hbs.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: How do acquisition events impact the performance of a firm's existing network of industrial units? Using a unique dataset from a Brazilian agribusiness company, I find that an existing unit that is geographically close to a recently acquired unit experiences a decrease in its performance after the acquisition occurs. In contrast, a unit that is operationally similar to an aquiree experiences an increase in its performance. The size of the incumbent unit buffers these effects.
