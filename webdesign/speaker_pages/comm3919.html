<br>Title: TMS Dissertation Award Winner: Decoupling Market Incumbency from Organizational Experience: The Case of  Anti-Cancer Drugs</br><br>Author: Lourdes Sosa, London Business School, Regents Park, London, United Kingdom, lsosa@london.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Focusing on the analysis of differences in R&D performance through a  technological change, I discuss two findings based primarily on my  dissertation research.  First, I discuss the empirical consequences of  failing to decouple market incumbency from organizational experience.  In  particular among those empirical consequences, I explain the resulting  distortion on the assessment of competitive advantage in research  productivity and in risk-taking behavior.  As second finding, I discuss the  advantages of separating R&D competences that are application-specific from  those that represent technological platforms, since their differential  distribution across firm categories significantly explains heterogeneity in  R&D performance during a discontinuity.</br>
