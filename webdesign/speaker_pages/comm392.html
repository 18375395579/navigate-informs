Title: The Customer May Not Always Be Right: Customer Compatibility and Service Performance<br>Author: Ryan Buell, Assistant Professor, Harvard Business School, Morgan Hall 429, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, rbuell@hbs.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dennis Campbell, Frances Frei<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We decompose the variance of 58,294 face-to-face retail banking transactions, quantifying the relative importance of customer, employee, process, location, and market-level effects on transaction satisfaction. In our models, customer-level differences account for a vast majority of the explainable variance. Subsequent customer, branch, and firm-level analyses suggest that these differences are explained in part by the degree of compatibility between each customer and the firm’s operating system.
