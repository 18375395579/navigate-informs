Title: Improving Biosurveillance System Performance<br>Author: Ronald (Ron) Fricker, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Rd. Rm 239, Monterey, 93943, United States, rdfricke@nps.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Syndromic surveillance systems are being implemented throughout the United States.  These systems use health-related data to look for possible bioterrorism events.  This talk will summarize the problem and describe an approach for managing the trade-off between the aggregate system-wide false alarms and the power to detect a bioterrorism attack.
