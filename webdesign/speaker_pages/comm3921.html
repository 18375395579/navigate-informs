<br>Title: The Rail Network Capacity Crunch:  Public and Private Goals</br><br>Author: David Hunt, Cambridge Systematics, Inc., PO Box 816, Pennington, NJ, 08534-0816, United States, dhunt@camsys.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Raphael Kedar</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Freight volumes are at record levels, creating capacity issues for all transportation modes.  The responsibility for expanding capacity on roads, ports, and airports falls on the public sector, while railroad capacity is a private sector responsibility.  There is often a disconnect between public and private goals.  This presentation looks at the capacity crunch and different visions for the rail network.  It also explores operations research methods needed to advance public and private goals.</br>
