Title: Optimal Multiple Stage Reliability Growth Test Plan Design for New Product Introduction<br>Author: Zhaojun Li, Reliability Engineer, ElectroMotive Diesel, 211 W 59th St Apt 3, Hinsdale, United States of America, zjli@uw.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This research reviews the major analytical activities for reliability growth test (RGT) planning during the new production introduction period. The impact of influential factors on the final achievable reliability for a new product is investigated using designed experiments. Testing cost for RGT is also analyzed in addition to achieving a better product reliability prediction.
