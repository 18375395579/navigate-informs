Title: Coordination and Flexibility Tradeoffs in Aluminum Recycling<br>Author: Elsa Olivetti, Research Scientist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., E38-434, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, elsao@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Tracey Brommer, Randolph Kirchain<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Recycling offers environmental and economic benefits to the aluminum industry, whose costs are driven by electricity use. This work explores models to improve recycling of aluminum including metal recovery from byproducts of production process. Models are developed to examine the value of operating coordinated recycling centers and aluminum remelting plants. The analysis quantifies the value of flexibility given the practical constraints of the operation and variation in product demand.
