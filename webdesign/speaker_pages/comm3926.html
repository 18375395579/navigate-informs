However, the ROSCA has not been much investigated at the quantitative level. This work analyzes the structure and probability, compared to bank transactions, of one type of ROSCAs which has a very long history in the East Asia. Unlike the previous studies, we approach the ROSCA using replication as often done in financial engineering. We identify some conditions that lead to existence of such private credit associations and optimal orders of participants in such systems.
