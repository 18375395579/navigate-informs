We consider projects where as the project progresses, the locus of responsibility shifts from one functional stakeholder to another.   We design optimal contracts for the functional stakeholders, factoring in the stakeholder’s preference to resource commitment, in order to maximize project value based on the project uncertainty and project monitoring costs.
