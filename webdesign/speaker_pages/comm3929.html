However,utilities became more hesitant to invest in baseload units because of the price instability and made investment plans with more peaking units, which makes them more dependent on power purchases. In this study, we discuss the challenges and opportunities during the integrated resource planning considering the effect of the renewable portfolio standards.</br>
