Title: Serving Strategy in Tennis<br>Author: Yigal Gerchak, Professor, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv 69978, Israel, yigal@post.tau.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Marc Kilgour<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Common practice in Tennis is to hit a powerful first serve. Should it fault, the second serve is usually much weaker. Recently it has been argued that this strategy is flawed - both serves should be powerful. According to our analysis, however, the current practice of a weaker second serve appears to be roughly optimal.
