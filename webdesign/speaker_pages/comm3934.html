This paper will use data from latest surveys of GA aircraft on the annual utilization levels, aircraft age, and types of installed equipment of various segments to examine the case for investment. Data on equipage costs in conjunction with data on aircraft values and operating costs will be used to examine the business case for various levels of investment in new avionics.
