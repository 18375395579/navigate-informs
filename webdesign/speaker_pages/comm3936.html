Title: An Ecology of Innovation<br>Author: James Utterback, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, jmu@mit.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Amid an increasingly diverse and chaotic scene of changing markets and widening competition, I will argue for thinking of innovation and firm formation as a process of experimentation in the market.  Rather than seeking to reduce uncertainty and to optimize, we should seek to increase possibilities for experimentation and for broader search and synthesis.
