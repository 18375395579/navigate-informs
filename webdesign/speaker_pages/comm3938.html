Title: Dynamic Matching Markets with Search Friction<br>Author: Nick Arnosti, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, narnosti@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yashodhan Kanoria, Ramesh Johari<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: It is often costly for agents in matching markets to determine whether potential partners are interested in forming a match. This creates friction in the marketplace, lowering welfare for all participants. We introduce a dynamic model that allows us to quantitatively study this effect. We demonstrate that simple interventions by the market operator (such as restricting applications or increasing the application cost) can dramatically benefit both sides of the market.
