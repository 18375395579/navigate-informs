Post-SOX the literature has shifted to the need for a variety of controls. Since end-user developed spreadsheets are relied on throughout an organization, formal techniques to control for quality are required. We discuss organizational controls and end-user roles, including formal software development techniques, needed to comply with SOX.</br>
