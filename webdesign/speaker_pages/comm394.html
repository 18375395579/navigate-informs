Title: Bayesian Networks for Employable Medical Expert Systems<br>Author: Rich Neapolitan, Professor, Northeastern Illinois University, 5500 N. St. Louis, Chicago, IL, 60515, United States, profrichneo@yahoo.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Medical expert systems date back to the 1970’s when MYCIN was created. In the 1990's a number of Bayesian network-based medical expert systems were developed. However, virtually none of them are deployed. I review the Bayesian network and its use in medical expert systems. Then I discuss design considerations necessary if we want do create a system that can seamlessly be incorporated into medical practice. Finally, I present Promedas, which is a system designed according to these considerations.
