Evaluation is performed on a social network constructed from census data of the Greater Toronto Area of 5 million individuals. One outcome of the analysis highlights the pitfalls of betweenness and centrality measures for maximum mitigation given an unknown initial spreader. Our analysis focuses on pandemic disease, but the approach is applicable to any network contagion.</br>
