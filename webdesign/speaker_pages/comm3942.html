Title: Photovoltaic Technology Options for Addressing Climate Change: an Expert Elicitation<br>Author: Aimee Curtright, Carnegie Mellon University, Engineering and Public Policy, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, aimeecurtright@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): David Keith, Granger Morgan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Expert elicitation is used to assess the future performance of 26 current and emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies. The likelihood of each achieving specific module price thresholds within given time frames is evaluated. For a subset of the technologies, experts provide insight into technical barriers to success, plausible ranges of efficiencies and prices in 2030, and appropriate policy levers for optimizing PV performance. Development of the survey and results will be discussed.
