<br>Title: An Econometric Analysis of Patients Who Leave the ED without Being Seen by a Physician</br><br>Author: Ehsan Bolandifar, The Chinese University of Hong KOng, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, ehsan@baf.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tava Olsen, Nicole DeHoratius</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present an empirical study of an emergency department (ED) in which patients may leave the waiting area without being seen by a physician (LWBS). Using operational data from a hospital ED, we show that wait time and number of patients in the waiting area significantly affect LWBS probability. In addition, observed service volume may affect LWBS probability but the magnitude of its effect depends on other factors. Our findings have implications for the management of hospital EDs.</br>
