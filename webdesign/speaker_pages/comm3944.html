In an alternate concept, governed by Autonomous Flight Rules, conflicts are detected and resolved in a de-centralized manner by individual aircraft. This talk explores high-level tradeoffs between such systems from a safety and reliability perspective, considering the failures of individual components and their potential impacts on safety.</br>
