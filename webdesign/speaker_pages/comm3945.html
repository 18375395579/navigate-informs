<br>Title: Designing Antithrombotic Therapy for Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation</br><br>Author: Beste Kucukyazici, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, QC, Canada, beste.kucukyazici@mail.mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vedat Verter</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Randomized trials show that antithrombotic therapy with warfarin reduces the risk of stroke, however it also increases risk of major bleeding. Given the benefits and risks of therapy, decisions are two-fold: initialization of the therapy, and the intensity of warfarin use. Hence, we aim to develop an analytical framework for designing optimal therapy with a patient-centered approach by incorporating complex probabilistic data and permitting explicit quantitative comparison of benefits and risks.</br>
