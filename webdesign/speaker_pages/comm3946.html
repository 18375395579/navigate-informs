The engineering improvements considered reduce the risk to the CIS by either limiting consequences or reducing their associated probabilities. The uncertainties inherent to future natural hazards are represented by hazard scenarios. The models are applied to realistic data from a coastal community to demonstrate the value of a system-wide approach to the CIS improvements.</br>
