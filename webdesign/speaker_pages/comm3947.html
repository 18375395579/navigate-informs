<br>Title: Aggregation of Prediction Distributions using Debiased Quantile Estimates</br><br>Author: Vicki Bier, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Room 3270A, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, bier@engr.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chen Wang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We discuss how to estimate expert overconfidence and biases using Bayesian quantile regression. We can then broaden and shift each expert’s distribution to offset any overconfidence or bias, and aggregate the adjusted distributions to obtain a consensus distribution.  Such methods allow us to account for: (1) asymmetry around the median; (2) correlations between different quantiles given by the same expert; and (3) correlations between experts who represent the same school of thought.</br>
