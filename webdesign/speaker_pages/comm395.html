Title: Percentile Optimization in Portfolio Management<br>Author: Aurelie Thiele, Associate Professor, Lehigh University, aurelie.thiele@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elcin Cetinkaya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate portfolio management problems where the decision-maker seeks to maximize a left-tail percentile of the return distribution. We discuss data-driven techniques to incorporate the percentile in a tractable formulation and present insights into the resulting strategy, both from a theoretical standpoint and in numerical experiments.
