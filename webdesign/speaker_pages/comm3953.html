Box 805, Winterthur, 8401, Switzerland, htz@zhwin.ch</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tobias Roithner</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the dynamics of a factory controlled by human production planners. We combine  human behavior with basic factory dynamics in a simulation model. We find that human expert knowledge improves the performance for normal operating conditions, but may lead to instability and loss of control in overload situations.</br>
