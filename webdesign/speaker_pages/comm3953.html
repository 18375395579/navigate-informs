Title: Production System Dynamics Under the Control of Human Planners<br>Author: Christoph Heitz, Professor, Zurich University of Applied Sciences, P.O. Box 805, Winterthur, 8401, Switzerland, htz@zhwin.ch<br>Coauthor(s): Tobias Roithner<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the dynamics of a factory controlled by human production planners. We combine  human behavior with basic factory dynamics in a simulation model. We find that human expert knowledge improves the performance for normal operating conditions, but may lead to instability and loss of control in overload situations.
