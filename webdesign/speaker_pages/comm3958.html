Hobbs, Robert R. Twilley<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Since the 1930s, the Mississippi River Delta has lost ~1.2 million acres of land.  Agencies are making important restoration decisions regarding the locations and methods of sediment and freshwater delivery.  We re-evaluate which of the proposed 27 projects are in the non-dominated set and discuss their tradeoffs, providing guidance for which projects give the biggest bang for your buck.
