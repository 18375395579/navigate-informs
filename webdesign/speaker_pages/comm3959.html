To ascertain the real benefits of RFID, we conduct a field study with a third party logistics company that deployed RFID at one of its outbound logistics operations. After controlling for product, process and customer mix, we find that RFID not only provides operational benefits through improvements in productivity and process quality, but also moderates transaction costs.</br>
