Frommer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A discussion of ideas and methods for approaching the incorporation of students from different disciplines on research projects with examples from Operations Research / Government and Operations Research / Engineering. An ideal outcome of an  interdisciplinary project is that students learn about a field other than their own, and how the disciplines interact. In so doing, they gain a deeper understanding of their own discipline. How can this outcome be fostered? Should each discipline have pipeline work that feeds into the overarching structure of the project? Is it effective to blend the  inter-disciplinary work throughout the project? How do we develop and encourage all members of the team to feel a sense of ownership in their roles as team members and leaders as they perform different aspects of the research?
