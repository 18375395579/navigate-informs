Title: Greatest Hits in Operations Research<br>Author: Gerald Brown, Distinguished Professor, Operations Research Department, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, GBrown@nps.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: What makes a discovery in operations research so fundamental it demands mastery from any compleat analyst?  Consider your personal collection of OR’s greatest hits (you maintain one, don’t you?).  Regardless of medium- refereed publication, lecture, book, computer program, course handout, press interview --- what motivates your selections?  The list I recommend to my colleagues and students includes some obscure entries, and fewer winners of our well-known awards than you might suspect.  Why is this?  What are the distinguishing telltales of a fundamental contribution, and how do we use these to discover as early as possible the importance of such a signal result?
