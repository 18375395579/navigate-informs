Title: Potential Competition of Biomass for Bioelectricity and Biofuel under Renewable Portfolio Standards<br>Author: Lizhi Wang, Iowa State University, 3016 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, lzwang@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mohammad Rahdar, Guiping Hu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the potential competition of biomass for bioelectricity and biofuel under the renewable fuel standard and renewable portfolio standards. Supply functions for biomass and other renewable energy sources are used to assess the availability of renewable energy resources; demand of renewable energy is estimated from EIA energy outlook, RFS2, RPS, and RPG.
