Title: Quantify Effects of Home Energy Management System under Dynamic Electricity Pricing<br>Author: Jingjie Xiao, PhD Candidate, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, jingjie.xiao@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Liu, Joseph F. Pekny<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A key hurdle for implementing real-time pricing of electricity is the lack of consumers?responses. Solutions to overcome the hurdle include energy management systems that can automatically optimize household appliance usage and PHEV charging via two-way communication with the utilities (or the grid). This talk will show how the optimization can be done and how such systems can be integrated with electricity markets?operation under various uncertainties through approximate dynamic programming.
