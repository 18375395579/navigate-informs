Title: RTO Market Operations under Uncertainty<br>Author: Paul Gribik, Consulting Advisor, MISO, 720 City Center Drive, Carmel, IN, 46077, United States of America, pgribik@misoenergy.org<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Commitment and dispatch of resources in a Regional Transmission Organization’s Real-Time market depend on forecasts subject to uncertainty. Improved stochastic optimization models that take into account the effects of uncertainty when clearing the market would be helpful. Investigation of pricing when operations are set by a stochastic optimization would be desirable. RTOs could also benefit from new products that could improve their ability to respond when conditions deviate from forecasts.
