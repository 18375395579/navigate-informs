Improved stochastic optimization models that take into account the effects of uncertainty when clearing the market would be helpful. Investigation of pricing when operations are set by a stochastic optimization would be desirable. RTOs could also benefit from new products that could improve their ability to respond when conditions deviate from forecasts.</br>
