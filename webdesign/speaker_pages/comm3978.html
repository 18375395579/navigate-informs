Title: Guiding Resource Allocations Based on Terrorism Risk<br>Author: Henry Willis, Policy Researcher, RAND Corporation, 201 N. Craig Street, Suite 102, Pittsburgh, PA, 15217, United States, hwillis@rand.org<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: With every regulatory or funding decision for a risk management program, society decides whether or not risk is tolerable. We compare estimates of terrorism risk in urban areas that received homeland security grants to other federal risk management decisions. Allocations are generally consistent with other federal risk management decisions. However, terrorism risk in several cities that received funding is below levels that are often tolerated in other risk management contexts.
