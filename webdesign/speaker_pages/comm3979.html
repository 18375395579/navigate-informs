Title: Machine Learning and Algebraic Geometry for Network Data<br>Author: Ian Dinwoodie, Assistant Professor, Portland State Universitty, PO Box 751, Portland, OR, United States of America, Ihd@pdx.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Understanding interactions and steady states for biological networks from data of multivariate time series requires a range of statistical and mathematical tools. Dimension reduction, machine learning, and algebraic geometry together can be used for practical questions of node dependence and exclusion from basins of attraction.
