<br>Title: Strategic Investment under Spillovers and Information Externalities</br><br>Author: Wenxin Xu, University of Illinois, 350 Wohler's Hall, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, wxu9@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): H. Dharma Kwon, Anupam Agrawal, Suresh Muthulingam</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of two firms with investment opportunities when the true economic value of the return is unknown.  In particular, we explore the impact of the spillover effects of investment and the information externalities, which arise when the one who invests later can observe the leader's profit stream and learn about the true economic value of the investment opportunities.  We find that their impact on the timing of investment is non-trivial.</br>
