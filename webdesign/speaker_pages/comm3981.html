<br>Title: Optimal Learning and Development Strategy for Entrepreneurial Product Launch</br><br>Author: Onesun Yoo, Assistant Professor, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, o.yoo@ucl.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tingliang Huang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: An early stage entrepreneurial firm with a new product concept must maximize the chance of successful product launch. To avoid developing an unwanted product, practitioners suggest a lean approach to development, i.e., a firm should iteratively launch an unfinished product to learn what the consumers want and to alter the final product goal whenever necessary. We formalize this approach via the Bayesian learning framework, and investigate the optimal development strategy.</br>
