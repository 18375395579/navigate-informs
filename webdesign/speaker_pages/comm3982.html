<br>Title: Multiplicative Utilities for Health and Consumption</br><br>Author: Sam Bodily, John Tyler Professor of Business Administration, University of Virginia, Darden Business School, 100 Darden Boulevard, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States of America, BodilyS@virginia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Casey Lichtendahl</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Two new multiplicative utilities offer correlation aversion and other advantages over an additive. They extend the QALY model. For constant health and consumption streams, they reduce to a double exponential utility in life duration, which can have risk aversion, decreasing absolute risk aversion, increasing relative risk aversion, as well as standard gamble probabilities (proportional time tradeoffs) that increase (decrease) in life duration and that exceed proportional time tradeoffs.</br>
