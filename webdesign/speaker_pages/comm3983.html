Title: Means, Variances and Limiting Distributions in Finite-horizon Markov Decision Problems<br>Author: Alessandro Arlotto, Duke University, The Fuqua School of Business, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, alessandro.arlotto@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): J. Michael Steele, Noah Gans<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The literature for Markov Decision Problems is huge but, despite a shared culture with the rest of applied probability, there are surprisingly few limit theorems for general classes of MDPs. This talk focuses on martingale (and other) methods that work well to obtain properties of the variance, and possibly of the distribution, for the total reward of some particular classes of finite-horizon MDPs.
