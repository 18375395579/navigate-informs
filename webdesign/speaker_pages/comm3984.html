<br>Title: Intraday Schedule Updating in the Presence of Uncertain (and Corellated) Arrival Rates</br><br>Author: Vijay Mehrotra, Assistant Professor, San Francisco State University, Department of Decision Sciences, 1600 Holloway Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94132, United States of America, drvijay@sfsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozgur Ozluk, Robert Saltzman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Agent schedules are typically created several weeks ahead of time.  There is significant evidence suggesting that actual call arrival volumes early in day can provide valuable information about the distribution of volumes later in the day.  We develop a framework for managers to make optimal intra-day resource adjustment decisions that take into account information that becomes available after the day begins. We also conduct empirical tests to demonstrate the value of this methodology.</br>
