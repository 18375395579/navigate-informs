But this is not renegotiation-proof: once punishment starts, firms have an incentive to let bygones be bygones. We propose a “punishment-fits-the-crime?strategy which is renegotiation-proof. This approach can also be viewed as defining the set of self-enforcing Nash-bargaining outcomes. Supply chain applications and extensions of our model are discussed.
