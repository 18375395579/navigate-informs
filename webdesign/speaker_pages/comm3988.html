Title: Structural Properties of the Semidefinite Linear Complementarity Problem<br>Author: Xianzhi Wang, PhD Candidate, UC Berkeley, IEOR Dep, UC Berkeley, berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, xzwang@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ilan Adler<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the Semidefinite Linear Complementarity Problem (SDLCP) which is a generalization of the Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) over the cone of semidefinite matrices. Following the traditional line of analysis of LCP, we present several characterizations of the SDLCP related to the structure of the solution set (such as uniqueness and convexity) that are related to specific properties of the underlying linear transformation (such as semimonotonicity and cross commutativity).
