Title: Integrated Assessment Models: Aligning the Research for the Decision-maker's Needs<br>Author: Robert Vallario, Program Manager, Climate Change Integrated Assessment Research Program, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Office of Science, 1000 Independence Ave., S.W., Washington, DC, 20832, United States of America, bob.vallario@science.doe.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have long been the front line, science-based tools for exploring the interactions and combined influences of human and natural systems in decades-to-century climate change.  They are strongly rooted in energy models. With greater national interest in understanding the potential consequences of climate change, and with other decision-maker’s needs in mind, DOE’s Integrated Assessment Research Program is realigning its research portfolio.
