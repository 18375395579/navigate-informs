Title: Geography in Online Peer-to-peer Lending<br>Author: Mingfeng Lin, University of Arizona, 1130 E. Helen St, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, mingfeng@eller.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Siva Viswanathan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study how geography affects investors' choice of loans to fund using data from Prosper.com, one of the largest online peer-to-peer lending websites. Using data from regular market conditions and from a natural experiment, we show that geography affects lender decisions, but this relationship is moderated by the nature of the loan request and the salience of geography in the marketplace.
