Title: Dynamic Capabilities in Evolutionary Fit: Knowledge From Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Analysis<br>Author: Stuart Horsburgh, Head of Division, Manchester Metropolitan University Business School, Aytoun Building, Aytoun Street, Manchester, UK, M1 3GH, United Kingdom, S.Horsburgh@mmu.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Zhi Wang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In the research we explore how cross-sectional and temporal linkages affect the evolution of policy choice combinations. We make the connection between the literature on complementarities and the resource-based view of strategy. Our solutions constitute conjectures and illustrate how different configurations of policy choices reflect differences in knowledge constructions at different points in time and we show how complex choice combinations emerge from a series of system transitions.
