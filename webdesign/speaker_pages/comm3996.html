Title: Computing Optimal Strategies to Commit to in Stochastic Games<br>Author: Joshua Letchford, Duke University, 308 Research Drive, Campus Box 90129, Durham, 27708-0129, United States of America, jcl@cs.duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Liam MacDermed, Vincent Conitzer, Ronald Parr, Charles Isbell<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Significant progress has been made recently in the following two lines of research in the intersection of AI and game theory: (1) the computation of optimal strategies to commit to (Stackelberg strategies), and (2) the computation of correlated equilibria of stochastic games. We unite these two lines of research by studying both theoretically and experimentally the computation of Stackelberg strategies in stochastic games.
