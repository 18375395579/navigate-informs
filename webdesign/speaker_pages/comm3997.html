Recent research has attempted to resolve this question by considering the variance of creative outcomes, yet this research has overlooked a simple examination of the overall distribution of outcomes. We demonstrate opposite effects of collaboration on each tail of the distribution: collaboration reduces the probability of poor outcomes without reducing the probability of extremely successful outcomes.</br>
