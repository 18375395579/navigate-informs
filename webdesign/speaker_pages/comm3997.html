Title: Collaboration and the Distribution of Creative Outcomes<br>Author: Lee Fleming, Harvard Business School, Morgan 485, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, lfleming@hbs.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: How does collaboration influence creativity and in particular, the invention of breakthroughs?  Recent research has attempted to resolve this question by considering the variance of creative outcomes, yet this research has overlooked a simple examination of the overall distribution of outcomes. We demonstrate opposite effects of collaboration on each tail of the distribution: collaboration reduces the probability of poor outcomes without reducing the probability of extremely successful outcomes.
