Title: Modeling Cost-effectiveness of Preventive Strategies for an Avian Influenza Pandemic<br>Author: David Hutton, Stanford University, 380 Panama St, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, billdave@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nayer Khazeni, Alan Garber, Douglas Owens<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The pandemic potential of Influenza A H5N1 virus is an international public health concern.  The effectiveness and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical prophylactic strategies to reduce mortality from pandemic influenza are not known.  We developed a dynamic transmission model of pandemic Influenza A H5N1 in a large U.S. metropolitan city.  We used this model to determine the drivers of cost-effectiveness for antiviral stockpiling and pre-pandemic vaccination.
