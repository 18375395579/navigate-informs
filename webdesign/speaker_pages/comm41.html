<br>Title: Approximate Solutions to Logistical Planning Problems in One-Warehouse Multi-Retailer Systems</br><br>Author: Jiawei Zhang, Assistant Professor, New York University, 44 West 4 St., Suite 8-66, New York, NY, 10012, United States, jzhang@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Max Shen, David Simchi-Levi, Chung-Piaw Teo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider logistical planning problems that take into account the issues of (i) inventory perishability and storage charges, (ii) management of backlog and/or lost sales, and (iii) cost saving opportunities due to economies of scale in order replenishment and transportation. We identify simple conditions and structural properties associated with these logistical planning problems and present approximation algorithms for them.</br>
