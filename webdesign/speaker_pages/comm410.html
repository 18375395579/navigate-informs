Title: Lost Sales and Emergency Orders under Stuttering Poisson Demand<br>Author: Jie Chen, PhD Student, School of Operations Research and Information Engineering,, Rhodes 257, Cornell University, ithaca, United States of America, jc562@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Muckstadt, Peter Jackson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the (S-1,S) inventory policy under stuttering Poisson  demand when the excess demand is lost or is routed to an emergency order  fulfillment system. We show a correction to results presented in Feeney  and Sherbrooke's paper in 1966. We show that the distribution of ordered  unit delivery times becomes more concentrated as the variance-to-mean  ratio of demand increases and we derive approximations for the mean and  variance of the number of units in emergency resupply.
