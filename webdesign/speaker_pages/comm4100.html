Title: Welfare and Equity Consequences of Transplant Organ Allocation Policies<br>Author: Utku Unver, Professor of Economics, Boston College, Boston, MA, United States of America, unver@bc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tayfun Sonmez<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present the first comprehensive model that analyzes welfare and equity consequences of various deceased-donor allocation, live donation, and live-donor exchange policies for transplant organ allocation. In particular, we propose a new exchange policy for live donors, to incentivize the participation of compatible pairs in exchange. We show that this policy can make all patient groups weakly better off with respect to the regular exchange policies in use.
