In addition to the three elements proposed by Lovelock (competition, cost structure, and client’s perceived value), we show that the price of a service should also take into account coproduction. We demonstrate that the co-producer can either be rewarded with cash or paid in nature. In this latter case, the co-producer is paid by a service especially tailored for her and coproduction can be seen as barter.</br>
