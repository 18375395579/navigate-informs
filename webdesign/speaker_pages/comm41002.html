Title: Combining Passenger and Freight Transportation with Public Scheduled Line Services<br>Author: Veaceslav Ghilas, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands, v.ghilas@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Tom van Woensel, Emrah Demir<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP) with public scheduled line services concerns scheduling a set of vehicles to serve two types of requests (passengers and freight). Part of the freight journey can be carried on scheduled public transportation. We propose an arc-based mixed integer programming formulation which is solved to optimality using CPLEX. Computational results provide a clear understanding of the benefits of combining passenger and freight transportation in current networks.
