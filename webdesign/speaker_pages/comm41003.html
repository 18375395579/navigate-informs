Once a vial is opened, it must be used before a time limit. The aim is to minimize the drugs waste and satisfy the treatment requests. The problem can be seen as a 2-constraint bin packing problem with additional due dates on the treatments execution inducing jobs sequencing constraints. A matheuristic and a recovering beam search are proposed and tested on bin packing instances with/without due dates.</br>
