Title: On a Queueing System with State-dependent Service Rate<br>Author: Xiaobo Zhao, Professor, Tsinghua University, IE Department, Qinghuayuan, Beijing, 100084, China, xbzhao@tsinghua.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Hao Zhang, Qi-Ming He<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We conduct a laboratory experimental study on some service systems.  Results indicate that the service rate of a server (i.e., a subject) depends on the number of customers in the queue, which is typically non-monotone.  Taking such state-dependent service into consideration, we introduce an M/M/1 type queueing model and analyze  the effect of the state-dependent service on system performance.
