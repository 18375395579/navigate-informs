Results indicate that the service rate of a server (i.e., a subject) depends on the number of customers in the queue, which is typically non-monotone.  Taking such state-dependent service into consideration, we introduce an M/M/1 type queueing model and analyze  the effect of the state-dependent service on system performance.</br>
