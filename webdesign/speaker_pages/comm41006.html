Title: Potential-aware Automated Abstraction of Sequential Games, and Holistic Equilibrium Analysis of Texas Hold'em Poker<br>Author: Tuomas Sandholm, Cernegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, sandholm+@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Troels Bjerre Soerensen, Andrew Gilpin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Prior abstraction algorithms for sequential games employ expected value as the similarity metric.  Ours considers a higher-dimensional space consisting of histograms over abstracted states from later stages.  Therefore it can capture potential.  With a fast equilibrium finding algorithm, this yielded GS3, a highly competitive bot for heads-up limit Texas Hold'em.
