<br>Title: Systemic Risk and Stability in Financial Networks</br><br>Author: Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, Uris Hall 418, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, alirezat@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daron Acemoglu, Asuman Ozdaglar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We argue that contagion in financial networks exhibits a form of phase transition as interbank connections increase: as long as the magnitude and the number of negative shocks affecting financial institutions are sufficiently small, more complete interbank claims enhance the stability of the system. However, beyond a certain point, such interconnections start to serve as a mechanism for propagation of shocks and hence, lead to a more fragile financial system.</br>
