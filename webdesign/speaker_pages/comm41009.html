Title: CVaR Absolute Norm: Stochastic Case<br>Author: Alexander Mafusalov, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, mafusalov@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stan Uryasev<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: CVaR absolute norm is CVaR of absolute value of a random variable. It is defined in two variations: scaled and non-scaled. L1 and L-infinity norms are limiting cases of the new family of norms. Several properties for CVaR absolute norm as functions of confidence parameter were proved. Dual norm for CVaR absolute norm is found. CVaR absolute norm as a Measure of Error generates a Regular Risk Quadrangle. Linear regression problems were solved by minimizing CVaR absolute norm of noise.
