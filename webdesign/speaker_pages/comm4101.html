Title: Variance Swaps on Time-changed Markov Processes<br>Author: Matthew Lorig, Princeton University, 5 Lincoln Ct, Princeton, NJ, United States of America, mlorig@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Roger Lee, Peter Carr<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We prove that the variance swap rate is just the price of a co-terminal European-style contract when the underlying is modeled as an exponential Markov process, time-changed by an arbitrary continuous stochastic clock. The payoff function of the European contract that prices the variance swap satisfies an ordinary integrodifferential equation, which depends only on the dynamics of the Markov process, not on the clock.
