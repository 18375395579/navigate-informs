Title: The Complexity of Game Dynamics: Sink Equilibria, BGP Oscillations, and Beyond<br>Author: Alex Fabrikant, Ph.D Student, UC Berkeley, 581 Soda Hall, CS Division, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1776, United States of America, alexf@cs.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christos H. Papadimitriou<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We prove the PSPACE-completeness of 2 problems about best-response Nash dynamics: approximating Goemans, Mirrokni, and Vetta's sink equilibria in graphical games, and predicting oscillation in internet interdomain routing as a function of BGP path preferences. We also propose a new equilibrium concept, unit recall equilibria, that appears algorithmically promising. A relaxation of it is shown to be both tractable and universal (guaranteed to exist in any game).
