Papadimitriou</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We prove the PSPACE-completeness of 2 problems about best-response Nash dynamics: approximating Goemans, Mirrokni, and Vetta's sink equilibria in graphical games, and predicting oscillation in internet interdomain routing as a function of BGP path preferences. We also propose a new equilibrium concept, unit recall equilibria, that appears algorithmically promising. A relaxation of it is shown to be both tractable and universal (guaranteed to exist in any game).</br>
