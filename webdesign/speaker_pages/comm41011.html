We distinguish between two on-line versions of the problem depending on whether the entire set of sites is known a prior or not. For the first version where the entire set of site is unknown, we present a best possible algorithm along with a matching lower bound. For the second version where the entire set of sites is known a priori, we present a best possible algorithm for n</br>
