Title: Inventories with Multiple Supply and Demand Sources and Networks of Queues with Overflow Bypasses<br>Author: Jeannette Song, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, jssong@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Zipkin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider an inventory system with several supply sources having different costs and leadtimes. Under a plausible heuristic policy, the supply system becomes a network of queues with a special routing mechanism called an overflow bypass. The solution has a simple product form.
