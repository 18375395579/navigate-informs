The Jets remained in the Southeast Division, creating an excessive amount of travel for those teams. We ask the question:  Which teams should be in which divisions in order to minimize a weighted sum of the distances between each pair of cities?  This optimization problem can be framed as a quadratic assignment problem.  We report on ``good league structures under a variety of conditions.
