Title: Simple Procedures for Scheduling Random Flight Arrivals<br>Author: Thomas Vossen, Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, 80309-0419, United States, vossen@colorado.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This presentation discusses algorithms for the allocation of airport arrival slots during Ground Delay Programs when there is uncertainty in the flights?arrival times. We introduce procedures and policies for allocating flights to slots, discuss fundamental properties of the resulting allocations, and describe how the resulting methods can be used to evaluate the impact of demand uncertainty.
