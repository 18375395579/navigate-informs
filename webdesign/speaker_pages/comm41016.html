Title: RANDOMIZED ALGORITHMS FOR THE HANDOVER MINIMIZATION PROBLEM IN WIRELESS NETWORK DESIGN<br>Author: Mauricio Resende, AT &T labs, Algorithms and Optimization, Shannon Lab, NJ, United States of America, mgcr@research.att.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We describe three randomized heuristics for HANDOVER MINIMIZATION: Given towers with demand, radio network controllers (RNCs) with capacity, and a matrix of handovers between pairs of towers, find a feasible assignment of towers to RNCs such that the number of handovers between towers connected to different RNCs is minimized.
