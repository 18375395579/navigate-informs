Title: Assessing Delay Propagation in Airline Plans<br>Author: Shervin AhmadBeygi, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, shervin@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Belobaba, Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Airline delays have many causes -- air traffic control, mechanical problems, weather. But many delays are also caused by the propagation of earlier delays. A single flight delay can cause several subsequent delays, as future flights await the aircraft, cockpit crew, cabin crew, and connecting passengers. We present an approach for analyzing and comparing the potential propagation of different airline plans.
