Title: Bayesian Analysis of Multiway Table of Genetic Effects: A Model Comparison Approach<br>Author: Xiaoquan Wen, University of Michigan, 1415 Washington Heights Road, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, xwen@umich.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the inference problem on unobserved quantities that can be represented by multiway tables. We focus on Bayesian model comparisons in complex linear systems, in which we show multiway tables are naturally formed by regression coefficients. We specify prior distributions to enable efficient information sharing across and within different dimensions of multiway tables. Analytic results of Bayes Factors and their approximations are derived and their various properties are discussed.
