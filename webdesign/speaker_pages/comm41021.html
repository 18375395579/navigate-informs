Title: A Matrix Game Approach for FTR Allocation in Electric Power Networks<br>Author: Tapas K. Das, Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, das@eng.usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cihan Babayigit<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop a matrix game theoretic modeling approach for allocation of financial transmission rights in electric power networks. The model considers the usual network constraints, contingencies, variability and the risk factor associated with the estimation of congestion cost, and the revenue adequacy condition. A learning based solution approach yields a multidimensional equilibrium bid vector for FTRs consisting of price, quantity, and mix of options and obligations.
