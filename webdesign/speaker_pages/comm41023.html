Title: Optimal Multipath Rate Allocation for Real-Time Streaming Applications<br>Author: Cathy Xia, Associate Professor, The Ohio State University, Dept. of Industrial & System Engineering, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, cathyhxia@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Zhen Liu, Alix Chow, Hao Yang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Multipath content delivery has become one promising  approach for improving the quality of real-time streaming.  One fundamental design issue is how to split the stream across different paths so as to meet the stringent end-to-end delay and loss requirements. Through modeling and asymptotic analysis, we have derived a closed-form optimal solution to the load splitting problem, and designed an online scheme for adapting the splitting decisions to the network dynamics.
