We take advantage from existing reliable rescheduling algorithms, incorporate them in a rerouting tabu search scheme, and investigate the effectiveness of different neighbourhood structures. Extensive computational experiments show the high potential of advanced reordering and rerouting algorithms to reduce delays and to improve the use of infrastructure capacity.</br>
