Title: A Tabu Search Algorithm for Rerouting Trains During Rail Operations<br>Author: Andrea D'Ariano, Delft University of Technology, Department of Transport and Planning, Stevinweg 1, GA Delft, 2600, Netherlands<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of train conflict detection and resolution, which is dealt every day by traffic controllers to adapt the timetable to real-time unpredictable events. We take advantage from existing reliable rescheduling algorithms, incorporate them in a rerouting tabu search scheme, and investigate the effectiveness of different neighbourhood structures. Extensive computational experiments show the high potential of advanced reordering and rerouting algorithms to reduce delays and to improve the use of infrastructure capacity.
