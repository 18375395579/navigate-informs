Title: New Computational Results on Solving the Sequential Procedure with Feedback<br>Author: David Boyce, Professor Emeritus, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60607, United States, dboyce@uic.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher O'Neill, Wolfgang Scherr<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk presents findings for alternative feedback solution procedures applied to a 1,000 zone model. Three methods were tested: Naïve Feedback (no averaging of trip matrices or link flows); Averaging with Constant Weights, applied to the trip matrices; Method of Successive Averages (MSA), also applied to trip matrices.
