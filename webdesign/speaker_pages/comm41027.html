Title: Approaches to Wireless Sensor Network Design and Routing for Prolonged Network Life<br>Author: Halit Uster, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, uster@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hui Lin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a general model and its variations to consider various objectives that define policies for wireless sensor network design and routing that promote efficiency in energy usage. The objectives include combinations of maximum and average energy usage at a sensor node and the remaining energy distribution at the sensor nodes. We present algorithmic approaches, an analysis of objectives with respect to energy distribution characteristics and computational results.
