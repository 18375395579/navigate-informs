Title: Social Network Effects on Strategic Customer Behavior: A Laboratory Investigation<br>Author: Yang Zhang, PhD Student, Pennsylvania State University, 479 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, yangzhang@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gary Bolton<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We examine a coordination game in which each player engages with players directly connected to her in a social network. We identify effects from both global and local network on coordination. Specifically, pooling and separating equilibrium are respectively observed in high and low density networks. Coordination increases with network density and individual connectivity. The observed equilibrium selection pattern can be explained by argument on coordination robustness against strategic risk.
