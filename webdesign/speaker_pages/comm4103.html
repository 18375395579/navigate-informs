<br>Title: Allocating Shared Resources Optimally for Call Center Operations and Knowledge Management Activities</br><br>Author: Abhijeet Ghosal, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States of America, abhijeet@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mani Subramani, Alok Gupta</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a problem where a call center should optimally allocate available resources to call handling and document creation tasks. The call center resolves on phone problems that engineers face in the field. Often when an engineer calls, he/she has to wait in a queue. To avoid this situation, documents discussing commonly occurring problems are published at a knowledge repository. The allocation of resources should be determined so that the average waiting time in the queue is minimized.</br>
