Title: Scheduling Commercials into Television Breaks<br>Author: Andreea Popescu, Senior Operations Research Scientist, Turner Broadcasting System, INC., 1050 Techwood Dr., Atlanta, GA, 30318, United States of America, Andreea.Popescu@turner.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a model to schedule commercial ads into television breaks. The complexity of the problem lies in trading off solution quality against computational time. The estimated average calls of the scheduler across all networks per day is 8,000 with peak 28,000; we present modelling techniques that achieve desired solution quality in a resonable time.
