It is known that in this setting revenue is maximized by a state dependent pricing policy with a threshold, whereby customers are barred from entry once the queue reaches a certain length.  We are the first to find the optimal threshold in closed form.  Our closed form uses the Lambert W function and leads to a very simple formula for optimal revenue.</br>
