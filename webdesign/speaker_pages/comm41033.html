Title: Stochastic Inventory Control with Multiple Sources<br>Author: Anshul Sheopuri, asheopur@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ganesh Janakiraman, Sridhar Seshadri<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a backordering inventory system under periodic review in the presence of two suppliers with different lead times and per-unit purchase costs. For this system, it is well known that a base-stock policy is not optimal (in general). We suggest several heuristic policies for this system. Our work builds on connections that we establish between the system with two suppliers and the Lost Sales inventory control system.
