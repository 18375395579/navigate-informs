Title: Interactive Multiobjective Optimization in Radiotherapy<br>Author: Kaisa Miettinen, Professor, University of Jyvaskyla, Department of Math Inf Tech, PO Box 35 (Agora), University of Jyvaskyla, FI-40014, Finland, kaisa.miettinen@jyu.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Henri Ruotsalainen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In radiotherapy, conflicting goals, i.e. treating a tumor with radiation without irradiating healthy tissue, cannot be satisfied simultaneously. We employ interactive multiobjective optimization to avoid specifying more or less artificial weights or penalties and trial-and-error planning. In our approach, a treatment planner can utilize one’s expertise and direct the solution process interactively to find the best treatment plan. We report encouraging results in both IMRT and brachytherapy.
