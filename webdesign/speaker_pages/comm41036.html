<br>Title: Negotiation Mechanisms for Coordinated Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Surveillance</br><br>Author: Greg Godfrey, Senior Manager, Metron, Inc., 11911 Freedom Drive, Suite 800, Reston, VA, 20190, United States of America, godfrey@metsci.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aren Knutsen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: As the size of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) fleets increases in the future, so will the need to coordinate these fleets effectively. In this paper, we define several negotiation mechanisms for autonomous, distributed coordination of surveillance tasks. These mechanisms are based on dynamic target swapping between UAVs, where the criterion for swapping can be greedy or cooperative and where the amount of information shared by UAVs can be relatively high or low. The results show that high-quality system solutions can be obtained through local optimization by individual UAVs. In addition, we show how the rate of convergence to good system solutions can improve given cooperative UAV behavior (adherence to system goals rather than strictly local goals) and greater information sharing.</br>
