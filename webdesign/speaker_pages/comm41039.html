Title: Supply Chain Design with Market Assignments Under Uncertainty<br>Author: Yasemin Merzifonluoglu, Visiting Assistant Professor, Florida International University, 10555 W.

Edwin Romeijn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Given a set of supply sources and a set of uncertain demands, we model the assignment of demands to supply points in order to minimize expected supply cost.  These problems have broad application in supply chain planning across multiple facilities. We employ a Branch and Price approach with associated pricing problems that take the form of “Stochastic Knapsack?problems. We discuss a numerical study that validates the performance of the Branch and Price algorithm.
