Title: How to Control Controlled School Choice<br>Author: Federico Echenique, Professor, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E California Blvd, Pasadena, CA, United States of America, fede@hss.caltech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bumin Yenmez<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We characterize choice rules for schools that regard students as  substitutes while at the same time expressing preferences for a  diverse student body. The stable (or  fair) assignment of students to schools requires the latter to regard  the former as substitutes. Such a requirement is in conflict with the  reality of schools' preferences for diversity. We show  that the conflict can be useful, in the sense that certain unique  rules emerge from imposing both considerations.
