Title: Maximizing Throughput of Bucket Brigades on Discrete Work Stations<br>Author: Yun Fong Lim, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, 50 Stamford Road, 178899, Singapore, yflim@smu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Kum Khiong Yang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The throughput of a bucket brigade on discrete work stations may be suboptimal because workers can be blocked even with the slowest-to-fastest ordering. We develop an analytical procedure to find policies that maximize the throughput for a given work distribution on the stations. When workers have very different velocities fully cross-training and sequencing them from slowest to fastest is almost always the best policy. Furthermore, limiting the work zone of workers may improve the throughput.
