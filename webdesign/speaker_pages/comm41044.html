Title: Smooth and Controlled Recovery Planning of Disruptions in Rapid Transit Networks<br>Author: Luis Cadarso, Technical University of Madrid, Pza. Cardenal Cisneros, 3, Madrid, 28040, Spain, luis.cadarso@upm.es<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper studies the integrated timetabling and rolling stock re-scheduling problem for disruption management in rapid transit rail networks. We consider passenger behavior while minimizing recovery time and schedule changes, which measure the quality of the recovery plan. We report computational tests on instances of the Spanish rail operator RENFE.
