Title: Capital Justification and Project Risk<br>Author: Phillip Lederer, Associate Professor, Simon Graduate School of Business Administration, Univesity of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14627, United States of America, lederer@simon.rochester.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Raith<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: his paper studies the agency problem  when project proposers have more information about project risk than the capital allocator, and the proposer can hide his actions.  We study this problem in two situations where risk matters: limited liability and risk aversion of   proposers, and seek optimal contracts.  We show that agency costs can be very large, and lower project value significantly.
