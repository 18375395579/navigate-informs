Title: A Contest Among Distributors Over Who is the Better Newsvendor<br>Author: Yigal Gerchak, Professor, Tel-Aviv University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Tel-Aviv, IS, 69978, Israel, Ygerchak@eng.tau.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Oshry Azriel<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Marketers often attempt to provide sales staff with extra incentive by awarding a prize to the best agent. But if the agents are newsvendors (in different regions), what does being better mean here? Presumably the better newsvendor has lower underages and overages than others, i.e., forecasting their respective demands better. That creates a game among the newsvendors. How does the equilibrium differ from a non-competitive setting?
