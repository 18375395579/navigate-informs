Title: Optimal Crane Scheduling<br>Author: John Hooker, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, john@hooker.tepper.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samid Hoda, Ben Peterson, Iiro Harjunkoski, Latife Genc Kaya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present an algorithm for scheduling cranes in a factory or mill. The cranes operate on a single track and cannot bypass each other. Each job to be scheduled consists of a sequence of pickup and delivery stops at predetermined locations and a time window. We combine a local search heuristic for assigning jobs to cranes and sequencing them with a dynamic programming algorithm that finds an optimal space-time trajectory for each crane.
