Title: A Faster Algorithm for Submodular Function Minimization<br>Author: Jim Orlin, MIT, jorlin@mit.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a submodular function f defined on a set V with n elements. We give a combinatorial algorithm that improves the previous best strongly polynomial running time by more than a factor of n.
