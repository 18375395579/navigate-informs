Title: On the Total Curvature of the Central Path<br>Author: Murat Mut, Ph.D student, Lehigh University, 200 W. Packer Ave, Bethlehem, 18015, United States of America, mhm309@Lehigh.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Tamás Terlaky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We highlight the relevance of two different curvature measures for the complexity of interior-point methods in Linear Optimization. Motivated by the d-step conjecture for the total geometric curvature of the central path by Deza, Terlaky and Zinchenko (2008), we prove a similar result for the local curvature measure first introduced by Sonnevend et al. in 1990.
