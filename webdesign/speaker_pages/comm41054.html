<br>Title: Order Acceptance for Two Classes of Demand with Heterogeneous Lead Time</br><br>Author: Liang Lu, Universit?catholique de Louvain, CORE, Voie du Roman Pays 34, L1.03.01, Louvain-La-Neuve, NA, B-1348, Belgium, nicowish@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alejandro Lamas, Philippe Chevalier, Tanja Mlinar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider an infinite horizon order acceptance problem with two classes of demands for a make-to-order manufacturer. One class of demand generates a higher profit but poses a stringent lead time, while the other class generates a lower profit but only require a loose lead time. We formulate the problem as a multi-dimension Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP), and provide two heuristic approaches, namely, a threshold-based policy and a state reduction approach via partial state aggregation.</br>
