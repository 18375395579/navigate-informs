One class of demand generates a higher profit but poses a stringent lead time, while the other class generates a lower profit but only require a loose lead time. We formulate the problem as a multi-dimension Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP), and provide two heuristic approaches, namely, a threshold-based policy and a state reduction approach via partial state aggregation.
