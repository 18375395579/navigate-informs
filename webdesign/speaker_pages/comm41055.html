Title: Optimal Batch Processing Stochastic Gradient Method for Adaptive Bayesian Classification: An Application to On-line Electroencephalogram Signal Processing<br>Author: Fatemeh Hashemi, Virginia Tech, 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, fatemeh.s.hashemi@gmail.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose optimal sampling strategies within Simulation Optimization(SO) problems, which best serves rapid parameter updating in settings that demand fast decision-making owing to the urgent nature of the questions posed. We apply our method for brains; signal classification towards online brain-computer interfaces and demonstrates its superiority over other sampling methods within SO context.
