<br>Title: Finite Horizon Dynamic Pricing of Perishable Assets under Competition</br><br>Author: Ming Hu, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, IEOR Department, New York, NY, 10027, United States, mh2252@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guillermo Gallego</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a finite-horizon, multi-player, non-cooperative, continuous-time, stochastic dynamic game of pricing perishable inventories and provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of open-loop Nash equilibria of the corresponding differential game. We show that fixed-pricing heuristics suggested by the open-loop Nash equilibria work well in the stochastic game in the sense that such equilibria are asymptotically (relative) epsilon Nash equilibria for the stochastic game.</br>
