Title: Staffing and Control for Call Center Outsourcing with Rework<br>Author: Jiheng Zhang, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, j.zhang@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Jin Fang, Eser Kirkizlar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a system with both in-house and outsourcer call centers. With certain probability, customers need to be rerouted to the in-house call center for further help after receiving service at the outsourcer. The pooling of the two call centers is allowed. Using a fluid approximation in a heavy traffic regime, we jointly determine the optimal control rule and the staffing policy that asymptotically minimize the staffing cost and long run holding cost subject to a service level constraint.
