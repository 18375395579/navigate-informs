<br>Title: The Data-driven Newsvendor: New Bounds and Insights</br><br>Author: Joline Uichanco, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, uichanco@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi, Georgia Perakis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the newsvendor model where the only demand information available is a set of independent samples drawn from the demand distribution.  We analyze the solution from the sample average approximation (SAA) and its “regret?with respect to the true distribution. New tight analysis reveals that the weighted mean spread of a distribution impacts the regret of the SAA solution. For log concave distributions, we derive a bound on regret of the SAA solution independent of distribution parameters.</br>
