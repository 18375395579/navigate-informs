Title: SRPT Scheduling and Large Deviations<br>Author: Bert Zwart, Associate Professor, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, bertzwart@gatech.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In recent years, the SRPT discipline has become highly relevant as potential scheduling discipline in, for example, web servers. Motivated by this, we consider the GI/GI/1 queue, and investigate the probability that a large sojourn time occurs under the SRPT discipline. We show that SRPT outperforms FIFO for heavy-tailed service times and that the reverse is the case for light-tailed service times. The results provide qualitative insights into the way large sojourn times occur.
