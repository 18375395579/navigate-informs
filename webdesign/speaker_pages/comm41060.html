Title: Optimal Infrastructure for Waste Biomass-Based Hydrogen<br>Author: Nathan Parker, ncparker@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yueyue Fan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Waste biomass-based hydrogen is an attractive alternative fuel but faces logistical challenges in siting and sizing facilities, and choosing delivery mode to minimize cost.  This study uses mixed-integer nonlinear programming to solve for the optimal number, location, and size of conversion facilities as well as hydrogen delivery mode.
