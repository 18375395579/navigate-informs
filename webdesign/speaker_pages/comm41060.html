<br>Title: Optimal Infrastructure for Waste Biomass-Based Hydrogen</br><br>Author: Nathan Parker, ncparker@ucdavis.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yueyue Fan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Waste biomass-based hydrogen is an attractive alternative fuel but faces logistical challenges in siting and sizing facilities, and choosing delivery mode to minimize cost.  This study uses mixed-integer nonlinear programming to solve for the optimal number, location, and size of conversion facilities as well as hydrogen delivery mode.</br>
