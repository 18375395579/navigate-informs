Title: Wind Turbine Offloading Strategy Optimization for GE Energy<br>Author: Jacmara Ching, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, jkcs3@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Santiago Diaz, Antonio Elosua, Oscar Harasic, Yonatan Mintz, Mario Solares Nassar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We created two tools to assist GE Energy with the wind turbine delivery and offloading processes. The first is a forecasting tool, which uses regression equations to forecast the arrivals of components at wind farms. The second is a sequencing tool, which utilizes a heuristic to find the optimal allocation of cranes at a given wind farm site. GE Energy can expect savings of $1.9 million from the implementation of these tools, and GE Energy’s customers may also expect savings up to this amount.
