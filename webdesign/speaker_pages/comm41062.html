The first is a forecasting tool, which uses regression equations to forecast the arrivals of components at wind farms. The second is a sequencing tool, which utilizes a heuristic to find the optimal allocation of cranes at a given wind farm site. GE Energy can expect savings of $1.9 million from the implementation of these tools, and GE Energy’s customers may also expect savings up to this amount.</br>
