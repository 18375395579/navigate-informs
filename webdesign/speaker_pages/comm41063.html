Title: Game-theoretic Approaches to Parallel Machine Scheduling<br>Author: Carlos Paternina-Arboleda, Chairman, Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, AT, Colombia, cpaterni@uninorte.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): Diana Ramírez<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A problem of scheduling jobs on two identical parallel machines is considered, minimizing two criteria. A mechanism is proposed to solve this problem as a 2-player non-cooperative game, under the framework of a 2x2 non-sum zero matrix. Each job behaves selfishly attempting to move to a previous position in the machine, generating a cost for its agent, minimizing total flow time. At the same time, a controlling agent allows movements of jobs between machines, minimizing maximum completion time.
