A mechanism is proposed to solve this problem as a 2-player non-cooperative game, under the framework of a 2x2 non-sum zero matrix. Each job behaves selfishly attempting to move to a previous position in the machine, generating a cost for its agent, minimizing total flow time. At the same time, a controlling agent allows movements of jobs between machines, minimizing maximum completion time.</br>
