Title: Solving the Coastal Gasoline Inventory-Distribution Problem<br>Author: W. Art Chaovalitwongse, Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, wchaoval@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lei Lei, Su Gao, Wen Chen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the problem of integrated planning and scheduling of the production, inventory, and coastal distribution operations involving capacitated vessels. Given that the loading and unloading setup times are port-dependent, we analyze the properties the problem and propose a sequential optimization algorithm to solve it.
