<br>Title: Average-Cost Approximate Dynamic Programming for the Control of Birth-Death Processes</br><br>Author: Dennis Roubos, VU University Amsterdam, Department of Mathematics, De Boelelaan 1081a, Amsterdam, 1081 HV, Netherlands, droubos@few.vu.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sandjai Bhulai</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Approximate dynamic programming when applied to average-cost decision problems with a countably infinite state space suffers from several computational issues. In particular, the algorithm may converge to non-stable solutions and requires knowledge on the average cost in advance. We address these issues by providing a theoretical basis for the approximation structure such that the unique stable solution will be attained. We illustrate this for the broad class of birth-death processes.</br>
