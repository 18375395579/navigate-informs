Title: Data-driven Order Set Optimization in the Pediatric Environment<br>Author: Yiye Zhang, Carnegie Mellon University, 4800 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, ichiyoz@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Rema Padman, James Levin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Order sets have the potential to improve care delivery by making it faster, easier and safer for the clinician to enter orders, guided by known best practices. This research combines stochastic optimization with clustering to model the development of automated, data-driven order sets with the objective of  minimizing usage costs.
