Title: Queueing with Future Information<br>Author: Kuang Xu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, kuangxu@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Madhu Sudan, Joel Spencer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Can forecasts significantly improve the performance of queueing systems? We study an admissions control problem: to redirect away incoming jobs up to a fixed rate, in order to minimize the resulting average queue length, Q. We show that Q diverges to infinity in the heavy-traffic regime under any online policy, but can be bounded given (even limited) future forecasts.
