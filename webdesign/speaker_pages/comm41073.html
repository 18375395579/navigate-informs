We study an admissions control problem: to redirect away incoming jobs up to a fixed rate, in order to minimize the resulting average queue length, Q. We show that Q diverges to infinity in the heavy-traffic regime under any online policy, but can be bounded given (even limited) future forecasts.</br>
