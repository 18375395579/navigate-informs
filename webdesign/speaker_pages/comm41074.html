Given a set of arrival and departure flights in a specified planning horizon, the model determines 4D trajectories of aircraft that minimizes total taxi time and maximize runway throughput subject to operational constraints and safety requirements. The main decision variables include the push-back time at gates, passage time of aircraft in taxiways, and the ordering of landing and takeoff flights.</br>
