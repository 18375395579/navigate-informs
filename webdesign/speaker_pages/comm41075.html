Bastian, Laura McLay</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Military emergency medical systems save lives by responding to casualty events and evacuating high-risk casualties to a medical treatment facility with air and ground MEDEVAC assets.  We propose a novel MIP model to optimally locate air and ground MEDEVAC assets and assign the assets to casualty events.  The objective is to maximize the proportion of high-priority casualties responded to within the Golden Hour.  Hypercube correction factors remove the assumption of asset independence.</br>
