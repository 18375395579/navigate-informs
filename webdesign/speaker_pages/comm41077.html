Title: Production Control with Stochastic Processing Times and Random Demand<br>Author: Vladimir Krasik, Stern School of Business, New York University, 44 West 4th Street, New York, NY, United States, vkrasik@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Lanker, Michael Pinedo<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper we consider the dynamic single class production control problem of a single make-to-stock  production facility with random production times and demand. For the three cases of underlying demand and production time processes ?deterministic, exponential and Brownian we compute total average cost, obtain optimal policies and make comparisons.
