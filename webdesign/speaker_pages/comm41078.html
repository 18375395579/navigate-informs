<br>Title: Two-stage Stochastic Optimization for Energy Planning in Microgrids</br><br>Author: Gabriela Martinez, Institute for Mathematics and its Applications, 207 Church Street SE, 306 Lind Hall, Minneapolis, MN, United States of America, mgmartin@ima.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nikolaos Gatsis, Georgios B. Giannakis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Microgrids are small footprint power systems featuring distributed generation from conventional and renewable energy sources, distributed storage, and controllable loads. This work tackles energy planning in microgrids where energy can be transacted with the main grid. First-stage decisions include conventional generation, storage, and controllable load schedules, while energy transaction and load adjustments take place at the second-stage to maintain the supply-demand balance.</br>
