The economy may be in either one of two regimes. Management  of the company would like to maintain the inventory level of the item as close as  possible to a target inventory level and would also like to produce the items at a rate  that is as close as possible to a target production rate. The company is penalized  by the deviations from the target levels and the objective is to minimize the total  discounted penalty costs over the long term. We consider two models. In the rst  model the management of the company observes the regime of the economy at all  times, whereas in the second model the management does not observe the regime of  the economy. We solve both problems and obtain the optimal production policy as  well as the minimal total expected discounted cost. We also study the case in which  the consumer demand for an item follows a geometric Brownian motion modulated  by a continuous-time Markov chain that represents the regime of the economy.</br>
