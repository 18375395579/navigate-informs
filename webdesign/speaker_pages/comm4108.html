<br>Title: Simultaneous Approximations for Adversarial and Stochastic Online Budgeted Allocation</br><br>Author: Shayan Oveis Gharan, Stanford University, 475 via ortega, Huang engineering center 314K, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, shayan@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vahab Mirrokni, Morteza Zadimoghaddam</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In the online budgeted allocation problem we are given a set of advertisers with their daily budgets. When a query arrives, its incident edges, and their respective weights, are revealed, and the algorithm must match to an advertiser, irrevocably. The objective is to maximize the total revenue, while respecting the daily budgets.  In this paper we design algorithms that achieving a nearly optimal 1-1/e worst case competitive ratio, while obtaining significantly better than 1-1/e on the average.</br>
