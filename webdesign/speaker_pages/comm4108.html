When a query arrives, its incident edges, and their respective weights, are revealed, and the algorithm must match to an advertiser, irrevocably. The objective is to maximize the total revenue, while respecting the daily budgets.  In this paper we design algorithms that achieving a nearly optimal 1-1/e worst case competitive ratio, while obtaining significantly better than 1-1/e on the average.
