Title: Resource Allocation in Stochastic Contests with Exponential Completion Times<br>Author: Pelin Canbolat, Dr., Technion, Haifa, Israel, canbolat.pg@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Uriel Rothblum, Boaz Golany<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a class of games where players compete to complete a task first by deciding on their resource allocation. Completion times are assumed to be stochastically independent and exponentially distributed with rate linear in the amount of resource allocated. Only the first player to complete the task earns a reward. We explore the mean-variance tradeoffs based on explicit representations of payoff probability distributions, means, and variances for any feasible resource allocation.
