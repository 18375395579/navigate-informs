Title: A Note on Power of Two Inventory Games<br>Author: Moshe Dror, Professor, University of Arizona, MIS, Eller College of Management, Tucson, AZ 85721, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, mdror@eller.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bruce C. Hartman<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Recently Anily and Haviv (2007) published a study showing that a group of products ordered in subsets using EOQ and a power-of-two rule has a cooperative game which is totally balanced and concave. We show that the game is analogous to the classical airport landing fee games. The solution can be constructed in polynomial time rather than by an integer program. The Shapley value can also be computed in polynomial time.
