Title: Estimating Travel Time Variability: Distinguishing Between Variability and Uncertainty Due To Measurement Errors or Ignorance<br>Author: Hani Mahmassani, Professor, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, masmah@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jiwon Kim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study presents a scenario-based approach to estimating travel time variability in a network, where the distribution of travel times is expressed as a mixture of scenario-specific component distributions with the scenario likelihoods as mixing weights.  We consider cases where the component distributions and/or the scenario weights are unknown, letting the estimation results reflect both true variability and the uncertainty due to measurement errors or ignorance.
