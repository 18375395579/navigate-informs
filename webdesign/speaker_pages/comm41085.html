<br>Title: Estimating Travel Time Variability: Distinguishing Between Variability and Uncertainty Due To Measurement Errors or Ignorance</br><br>Author: Hani Mahmassani, Professor, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, masmah@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jiwon Kim</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study presents a scenario-based approach to estimating travel time variability in a network, where the distribution of travel times is expressed as a mixture of scenario-specific component distributions with the scenario likelihoods as mixing weights.  We consider cases where the component distributions and/or the scenario weights are unknown, letting the estimation results reflect both true variability and the uncertainty due to measurement errors or ignorance.</br>
