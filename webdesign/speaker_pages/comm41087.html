Title: When Zero Search Cost is too High: What Does it Take to Make Consumers Search?<br>Author: Ernan Haruvy, The University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, SM 32, 2601 North Floyd Road, Richardson, TX, United States, eharuvy@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Popkowski-Leszcyc<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine individual choice between pairs of simultaneous auctions that are either ex-ante identical or that differ in one of the following respects: direct incentives to search, shipping costs, minimum starting bid, duration and secret reserve. We also included an incentive to search for some of the pairs. We investigate the extent to which individuals bidding in these auctions choose optimally over auctions, the extent they switch between auctions, and factors that influence these outcomes.
