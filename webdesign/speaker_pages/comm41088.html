Title: A Distributed Switch Scheduling Algorithm<br>Author: Petar Momcilovic, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 1301 Beal Av, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, petar@eecs.umich.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) algorithm is a high-performance scheduling algorithm for cross-bar switches. It is known that MWM performs optimally under heavy loads and results in low packet delays. However, its centralized nature and high computational complexity limit algorithm’s applicability. We present a randomized algorithm for distributed switch scheduling that is capable of delivering high throughput.
