Title: Investigating the Relationship between Datalink, Controller Workload, and Vectoring Efficiency<br>Author: Mark Hansen, Professor, U.C. Berkeley, 114 McLaughlin Hall, U.C. Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, mhansen@ce.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sarah Yenson, Jasenka Rakas<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Increased air traffic leads to increased radio frequency usage and controller workload.  Previous work indicates a link between controller workload and vector distances assigned to potentially conflicting aircraft.  We argue that by introducing air-to-ground datalink communications, a reduction in workload, and therefore a reduction in vector distances, can be achieved.
