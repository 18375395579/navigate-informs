<br>Title: Optimal Dynamic Mechanism Design with Costly Information Acquisition</br><br>Author: Negin Golrezaei, University of Southern California, 1230 W.29TH ST. apt 10, LOS ANGELES, Ca, 90007, United States of America, golrezae@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hamid Nazerzadeh</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the role of the information revelation and acquisition in online advertising auctions. In online advertising, cookies provide valuable information for advertisers. We consider the problem of designing optimal mechanisms for the setting that advertisers incur cost to acquire such additional information via cookie-matching services. Our mechanism maximizes the virtual surplus considering the cost of information acquisition.</br>
