Title: Transforming Stochastic Dynamic Programs to Yield a FPTAS, with an Application<br>Author: Frans Schalekamp, Cornell University, School of OR&IE, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, frans@cs.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Shmoys<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Methods to transform (certain) Stochastic Dynamic Programs to yield a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) are proposed. The methods are generalizations of a method proposed by Halman et al. Finally an application in option pricing is presented.
