<br>Title: Online Scheduling with Known Arrival Times</br><br>Author: Nicholas G. Hall, Ohio State University, 2100 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, United States, hall.33@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc Posner, Chris Potts</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider minimizing total weighted completion time in an online scheduling environment where jobs only arrive at known times. We describe an online scheduling algorithm, and show that its competitive ratio is best possible. This result is established by constructing a system of inequalities that characterizes all possible job completion times in a schedule delivered by our algorithm. Two special cases are also studied.</br>
