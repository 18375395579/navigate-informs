To reduce the setup cost of maintenance, a joint maintenance interval is proposed. The optimal maintenance interval and control limits of components are determined by minimizing the average long-run cost rate related to maintenance and downtime. Moreover, a numerical study with a case of wind farm maintenance is performed based on a large number of non-identical components.</br>
