Title: Optimal Control of a Flexible Server in an Assembly System with Setups<br>Author: Nilay Argon, University of North Carolina, 205 Smith Building CB#3260, Chapel Hill, NC, United States, nilay@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chun Tsai<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider an assembly system with a single flexible server, multiple feeder stations, and an instantaneous assembly operation. For such a system, we are interested in the optimal control of the server with the objective of minimizing the long-run average holding and setup costs. We provide several sets of conditions under which we can characterize the optimal policy.
