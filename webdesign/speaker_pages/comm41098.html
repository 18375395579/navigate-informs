Title: Dual Time Scale Dynamic User Equilibria with Demand Growth: Formulation and a Convergent Algorithm<br>Author: Terry Friesz, Marcus Professor, Penn State University, Department of Industrial & Mfg Engr., 305 Leonhard Bldg, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, tfriesz@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Rigdon, Changhyun Kwon, Tae Il Kim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We approximate the dynamic network loading problem by a system of ordinary differential equations. This approximation is used in conjunction with a fixed point algorithm to solve the dynamic user equilibrium problem. Some numerical examples are presented.
