Title: Efficient Contract Design in Multi-Principal Multi-Agent Supply Chains<br>Author: Thomas Weber, Assistant Professor, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, Terman Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305-4026, United States, webert@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hongxia Xiong<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a general multi-principal multi-agent contracting game in a complete-information supply-chain setting and determine coordinating equilibrium transfer schedules in closed form. We allow for multidimensional actions and arbitrary payoff externalities between all members of the supply chain. For the coordinating contracts to exist it suffices that all payoff functions are continuous on the compact action sets in a general sense that accommodates discrete action sets.
