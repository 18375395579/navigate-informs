Suppose X is specified by random draws from the prior probability, p(X). The author has seen some individuals integrate p(Y|X) p(X) over all values of X to get the prior probability over Y. But this approach ignores the prior over Y.  This paper presents a more appropriate way of computing the posterior probability.</br>
