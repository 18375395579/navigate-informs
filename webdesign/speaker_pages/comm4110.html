Title: Correcting a Common Problem in using Bayes Rule with Models and Simulations<br>Author: Robert Bordley, Booz Allen Hamilton, Troy, MI, United States of America, Bordley_Robert@bah.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Let Y be a possible stochastic function of X. Suppose X is specified by random draws from the prior probability, p(X). The author has seen some individuals integrate p(Y|X) p(X) over all values of X to get the prior probability over Y. But this approach ignores the prior over Y.  This paper presents a more appropriate way of computing the posterior probability.
