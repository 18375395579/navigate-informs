Title: Cost and Aggregation Error Tradeoff Analysis for Some Location<br>Author: Richard Francis, Professor Emeritus, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, francis@ise.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Lowe<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Every mathematical modeler faces the problem of how much detail to build into the model. We consider this problem for a class of location models, where detail is inversely proportional to demand point aggregation error. We show the problem can be formulated, and analyzed, as a multicriteria decision problem. The law of diminishing returns plays an important role.
