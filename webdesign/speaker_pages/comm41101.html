Title: Optimal Sensor Placement for Underwater Threat Detection<br>Author: Anton Molyboha, Ph.D. student, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, amolyboh@stevens.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Zabarankin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Mathematical models for underwater acoustic sensors have been proposed. Single-period and multi-period statistical models for threat detection by a network of sensors have been suggested. Optimization approaches for optimal sensor placement within an urban harbor have been developed. The limit theorem about optimality of quasi regular sensor placement under certain conditions has been proved, and numerical experiments illustrating this result have been conducted.
