Title: Optimal Routing in a Channel with Failure-prone Links<br>Author: David Abdul-Malak, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, dta10@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Kharoufeh<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study optimal dynamic link selection in a hybrid channel with two diverse links. Specifically, the faster link is failure-prone while the slower link is not. The objective is to minimize the long-run average number of jobs in the system. We show that it is always optimal to use the faster link when it is available, irrespective of its failure and repair rates.  For the slower link, we prove the optimality of a threshold policy that depends on the queue length and the state of the faster link.
