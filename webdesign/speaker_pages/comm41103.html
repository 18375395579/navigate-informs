<br>Title: Machine Learning with Operational Costs</br><br>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, rudin@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Theja Tulabandhula</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We aim to merge the way estimation algorithms are designed with how they are used for a subsequent task. We consider the operational cost of carrying out a policy, based on a predictive model. The operational cost becomes a regularization term in the learning algorithm's objective, allowing either an optimistic or pessimistic view of possible costs. Limiting the operational cost reduces the hypothesis space, and can thus improve generalization. We bound the complexity of such hypothesis spaces.</br>
