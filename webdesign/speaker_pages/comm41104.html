<br>Title: An Adaptive Algorithm for Multiple-Fare-Class Capacity Control Problems</br><br>Author: W. Tim Huh, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, 500 W. 120th Street, MC4704, New York, NY, 10028, United States, th2113@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paat Rusmevichientong</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a single-resource capacity control problem where demands for several fare classes arrive sequentially and are independent of one another. The manager does not know the demand distributions explicitly, but instead has access to historical data. We consider repeated sales of a fixed capacity and develop an adaptive algorithm that determines protection levels over time based on historical sales data.</br>
