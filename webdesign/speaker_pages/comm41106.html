From a central depot routes has to be designed to serve at set P of distribution points and a set H of customer homes. While points in P remain the same and must be served by the same vehicles, H varies from day to day.  We propose a new algorithmic approach based on a decomposition of the problem to handle the demand variations over the time-horizon.
