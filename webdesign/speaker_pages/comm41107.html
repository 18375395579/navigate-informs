<br>Title: Vehicle Trajectory Estimation using Mobile Sensor Data</br><br>Author: Zhanbo Sun, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 2162, 14th Street, 2nd Floor, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, sunz2@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Ban</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We aim to estimate trajectories of unsampled vehicles from those sample vehicle trajectories around a signalized intersection. The estimated trajectories together with the sample trajectories can provide a more complete picture of the intersection traffic flow. The proposed method is based on the variational formulation for traffic flow.</br>
