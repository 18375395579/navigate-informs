<br>Title: A Large-scale Service System with Packing Constraints</br><br>Author: Sasha Stolyar, Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, NJ, United States of America, stolyar@research.bell-labs.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuan Zhong</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a model motivated primarily by the problem of an efficient assignment of virtual machines to physical hosts in a network cloud to minimize the number of occupied hosts. There are multiple input flows of different customer types and infinite number of servers. Each server may simultaneously serve multiple customers, subject to general packing constraints. We show that certain versions of greedy packing are asymptotically optimal as the input flow rates grow to infinity.</br>
