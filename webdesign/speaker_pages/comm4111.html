<br>Title: Designing Supply Networks and Facilities with Robust Order-to-Delivery Capability</br><br>Author: Benoit Montreuil, Professor, Laval University, CIRRELT, Pav. P. Prince, Office 2533, Québec, QC, G1K 7P4, Canada, benoit.montreuil@centor.ulaval.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alain Martel, Marc Paquet</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present an optimization methodology for the design of supply networks and facilities operating in an assemble-to-order or make-to-order context, having the robust capability to deliver products to geographically distributed customers within a to-be-specified offer in each market segment, combining an order-to-delivery time and a service level, given that daily demand is stochastic and dependent on the offer.</br>
