Title: Flexible Aggregation in Output Homothetic Production (Coauthor N.C. Petersen)<br>Author: Ole Bent Olesen, Professor, University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, Odense M, DK5230, Denmark, ole@sam.sdu.dk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The standard approach of cost efficiency estimation of hospital uses common tariffs. More than one set of tariffs are suggested for the estimation of a number of homothetic sub-technologies in the relevant subspaces of the full output space. Methods for combining these homothetic sub-technologies into homothetic overall technology are suggested. Assuming homothetic structures with a common scaling law (not necessarily CRS) is shown to provide a link.
