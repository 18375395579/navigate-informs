Each agent maintains and updates his estimate based on his own cost function, and communicates with a subset of agents (his neighbors).  We consider the case when agents update the estimates using sub-gradient directions and a constant step-size rule. Our main result provides an error bound on sub-optimality of the agent estimates.</br>
