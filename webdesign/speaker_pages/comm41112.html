Title: Cost Optimization under Capacity Uncertainty in Ground Delay Program:A Single Airport Case<br>Author: Yi Liu, University of California, Berkeley, 107 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, liuyi.feier@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this study, we present how optimal GDP clearance time could be decided for different GDP scopes by minimizing expected delay cost based on a deterministic queueing model. The proposed cost function considers predictability effects, which allows us to assess how ‘predictability premium?affects the optimal GDP solution.
