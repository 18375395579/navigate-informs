Title: New Error Bounds for Approximations from Projected Linear Equations<br>Author: Huizhen Yu, Department Computer Science, University of Helsinki, PO Box 68 (Gustaf Hallstromin Katu 2b), Helsinki, Finland, janey.yu@cs.helsinki.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Dimitri Bertsekas<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider linear fixed point equations and their approximations by projection on a low dimensional subspace. We derive new bounds on the approximation error of the solutions for both contraction and non-contraction fixed point mappings. Our bounds are expressed in terms of low dimensional matrices and can be computed by simulation. When the fixed point mapping is a contraction, one of our bounds is always sharper than the standard worst case bounds.
