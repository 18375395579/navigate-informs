<br>Title: Minimizing Class-Based Completion Time Variance in Single Machine Systems</br><br>Author: Xueping Li, Assistant Professor, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Xueping.Li@utk.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuerong Chen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of scheduling a set of simultaneously available jobs on one machine. The jobs come from several different classes of source. The problem is to determine a schedule to minimize the class-based completion time variance (CB-CTV) in which both earliness and tardiness are penalized. We prove that a CB-CTV problem can be transformed into a series of CTV problems and propose an algorithm to achieve differentiated mean completion time for different class of jobs.</br>
