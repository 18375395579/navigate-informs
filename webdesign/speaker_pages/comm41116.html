Title: Installed Base Management with Deterministic Obsolescence<br>Author: Cerag Pince, PhD. Candidate, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Room H09-06, Burg. Oudlaan 50, P.O. Box 1738, Rotterdam, DR, 3000, Netherlands, pince@few.eur.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Rommert Dekker<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: For slow moving items using install base information may lead to very accurate forecasts of time and magnitude of sudden drops in demand rate. When such characteristics are known in advance, prior action can be taken to remove excess stocks in order to adjust the new inventory position. We consider a continuous review inventory system in which the demand rate can shift to a lower state at a deterministic time point and propose approximate solutions for the optimal time to remove excess stocks.
