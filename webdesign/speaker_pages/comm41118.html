Title: The Maximin HAZMAT Routing Problem<br>Author: Vladimir Marianov, Professor, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Department of Electrical engineering, Av. Vicuña Mackenna 4860, Santiago, 782 0436, Chile, marianov@ing.puc.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Andres Bronfman, Armin Luer-Villagra<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a model for maximizing the distance between a HAZMAT transportation route over a network and its closest vulnerable point (schools, hospitals, nursing homes) in an urban area. Although such a model would require a very large number of node-arc assignment variables and constraints, we manage to reduce them to a manageable amount. Computational experience is provided for a 1,521 arc, 504 node, 30 populated center network in Santiago, Chile.
