Title: An Adaptive Algorithm for Dynamic Assortment Optimization<br>Author: Paat Rusmevichientong, paatrus@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Max Shen, David Shmoys<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of dynamic assortment optimization.  In our model, a retailer does not have any prior knowledge about the demand for each product, and must learn the demand by offering different product assortments and observing customer purchases. We propose an adaptive algorithm that integrates demand learning with assortment optimization, and establish convergence properties of the algorithm. Numerical results validate the performance of the algorithm.
