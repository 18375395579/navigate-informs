<br>Title: Transit Hyperpath under General Headway Distribution</br><br>Author: Qianfei Li, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60201, United States of America, qianfei-li@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peng Chen, Yu Nie</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In hyperpath algorithm, the attractive set is obtained in closed form because of Exponential headway assumption, which is difficult to justify both in theory and real data. The data from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) indicates that log-logistics, Gamma and Erlang distribution are better alternatives. Hyperpath algorithm is conducted based on Erlang distribution due to its special properties. Our results indicate that Erlang distribution generate different hyperpath from Exponential.</br>
