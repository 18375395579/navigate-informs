<br>Title: Balancing Production, Inventory, and Delivery Costs in Paper Manufacturing</br><br>Author: Neil Geismar, Texas A&M University, 320 Wehner, College Station, TX, United States of America, NGeismar@mays.tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nagesh Murthy</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Supply chain scheduling in the paper industry minimizes the sum of production, inventory, and delivery costs.  A single plant serves multiple clients.  Each customer’s order contains multiple jobs; each job has its own weight and width. The plant combines jobs from different customers into production sets of uniform weight and limited total width.  Distribution is via a limited number of capacitated railcars.  Inventory is expensive, because of product's bulk.</br>
