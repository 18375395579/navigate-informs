<br>Title: How Many Containers to Inspect to Deter Terrorist Attacks</br><br>Author: Naraphorn Haphuriwat, Research Assistant, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 3237 Mechanical Engineering Building, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, naraphoh@cae.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vicki Bier</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This research project aims to construct a model for identifying the optimal number of containers to inspect in order to minimize the defender’s expected loss, using game theory. We consider multiple types of attackers; each deciding whether to smuggle a particular type of weapon into the U.S. Results show that with a sufficiently high detection probability (and a sufficiently high smuggling cost to the attacker), attackers can be deterred with less than one hundred percent inspection.</br>
