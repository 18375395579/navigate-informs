Title: Dual-Connected Steiner Trees and their Application to Reliable Video Broadcasts<br>Author: Dave Allen, Verizon  Network & Technology, 2400 N Glenville Rd, Richardson, TX, 75082, United States of America, dave.allen1@verizon.com<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Kubat<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recent deployment of ROADM (Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers) in medium/long haul telecom networks has allowed a cost efficient distribution of broadcast video channels via a simple tree topology. Models for such a broadcast node/link failure protected network are developed and solved for minimum cost.
