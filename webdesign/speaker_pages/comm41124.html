Title: Up, Up, and Away: A Network Flow Approach to a Pilot Scheduling Problem<br>Author: Anthony Illig, Air Force Institute of Technology, AFIT/ENS, Bldg 641, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-7765, United States of America, Anthony.Illig@afit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): August Roesener<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a network flow linear program to schedule newly commissioned United States Air Force pilots into initial skills training. The solution schedules pilots graduating from different sources at different times to one of each of the courses in the initial skills training sequence: Air and Space Basic Course, Introductory Flight Screening and Undergraduate Pilot Training. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the total number of unproductive days students spend waiting for training.
