Title: Critical Node Detection in Coupled Interdependent Networks with Uncertain Failure Propagations<br>Author: Konstantin Pavlikov, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States of America, kpavlikov@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Veremyev, Vladimir Boginski, Stan Uryasev<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying critical nodes in interdependent networks whose deletion causes the maximum damage to the network with uncertain failure propagations. To quantify the damage, we use Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of two commonly used disruption metrics: total number of disabled nodes and total number of disabled pair-wise connectivities. Scenario-based linear IP model and exact algorithm are developed and compared for small-sized network instances.
