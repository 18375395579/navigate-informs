Title: Determining the Number of Battery  Stations and that of Pits for EVs Based on Japanese Networks<br>Author: Yudai Honma, Waseda University, 60-02-05A, Okubo 3-4-1,, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan, yudai@aoni.waseda.jp<br>Coauthor(s): Shigeki Toriumi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Electric vehicles (EV) have attracted an increasing amount of attention.  However, the continuous cruising distance of an EV is insufficient for everyday use. Battery capacity is the limiting factor in long-distance EV travel. In planning the EV infrastructure, an appropriate number of EV stations and chargers must be installed. In this study, we propose a mathematical model for estimating the number of stations and that of pits in Japanese road networks.
