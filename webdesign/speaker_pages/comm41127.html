Title: On the Optimal Control of Matching Queues<br>Author: Itai Gurvich, Northwestern University - Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, IL, United States of America, i-gurvich@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amy Ward<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a dynamic matching problem in which arriving jobs can leave the system only after being matched with one or multiple jobs of different types. In high-volume systems, a “matching pooling?condition,  reminiscent of the “resource pooling condition?in parallel server queues, facilitates a reduction of the original problem to an equivalent shortage formulation. We prove that a greedy policy based on repeatedly solving static matching problems is asymptotically optimal.
