<br>Title: Robust Security-constrained Unit Commitment with Dynamic Ratings</br><br>Author: Anna Danandeh, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, annadanandeh@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The actual capacity of overhead transmission lines and gas generators  vary by their ambient temperatures. To provide efficient and also reliable generation and dispatch decisions, we develop a two stage robust unit commitment formulation considering both dynamic line and generation ratings, subject to the uncertainty in weather conditions. Our model is demonstrated on standard IEEE testbeds as well as real industrial data.</br>
