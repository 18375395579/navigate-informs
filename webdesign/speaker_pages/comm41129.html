Title: The Combined Distribution and Stochastic Assignment Problem with Distance Constraints<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas, Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shoupeng Tang, Nan Jiang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper represents a combined distribution and stochastic assignment model which is developed for destination and route choice among two kinds of trips. One kind of the trips is traveled by gas vehicles which will be assigned to all destinations and all reasonable paths, and the other is traveled by electric vehicles which are subject to distance constraints. For both types of trips, the travel demand will be allocated to destinations and paths according to principles of distribution and stochastic user equilibrium. A solution algorithm for the model is developed.
