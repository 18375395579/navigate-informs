Title: Network Carrier Characteristics in the Determination of Passenger Choice<br>Author: Zuozheng Wang, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland, 3344 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, zuowang@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Dresner<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Determinants of passenger choice are examined between two network carriers on duopoly routes from their common Chicago hub. In particular, we test consumer preference for mainline carrier flights over commuter flights and see whether consumers factor historic flight delay information into their choice between carriers. Our major findings are that both commuter carrier flights and delay history have significant impacts on passenger choice.
