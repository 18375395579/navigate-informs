Of particular interest is the case where there is a one-time opportunity that may, with known information, occur in the short-term.  In this paper we integrate a one-time, probabilistic opportunity with the on-going decisions.  We show that order-up-to-level is the optimal policy and we obtain the exact form of the optimal solution.</br>
