Title: Solving the Reshuffling Problem in a Distribution Center<br>Author: Jennifer Pazour, Assistant Professor, University of Central Florida, 4000 Central Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL, 32816, United States of America, Jennifer.Pazour@ucf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hector Carlo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Over time, product demand profiles change; consequently, the assignment of products to locations in a distribution center also changes over time.  We study the reshuffling problem, which occurs when products need to be rearranged in a distribution center.  We develop a mathematical model and solution approach to determine the movement sequence that should be taken to transform an initial layout to a desired, final layout that minimizing travel time costs.
