Title: New Results Concerning Probability Distributions with Increasing Generalized Faiure Rates<br>Author: Prakash Mirchandani, University of Pittsburgh, Katz Graduate School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States of America, pmirchan@katz.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mihai Banciu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The generalized failure rate (GFR) of a random variable is an extension of its hazard rate. If the valuation distribution of a product has an (strictly) increasing GFR, then the associated revenue function is unimodal, and its global maximum is (uniquely) specified. This talk proposes an alternate economic viewpoint that extends the commonly accepted definition of the GFR and presents some new properties related to the closure of IGFR distributions under different operations.
