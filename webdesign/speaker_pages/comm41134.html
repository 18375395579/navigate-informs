By double-Laplace transform, analytical solution is given. And the option price is given by Laplace inversion algorithm. We prove the non-singular property of the matrix which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Extensional barrier options are also formulated. Numerical examples are given at the end of the paper.</br>
