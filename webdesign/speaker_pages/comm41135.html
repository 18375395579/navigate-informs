Murat, Ratna Babu Chinnam</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper addresses routing of time-sensitive freight shipments subject to congestion on the road network and flight departure delays. We propose a stochastic dynamic routing model on the road-air inter-modal network. Routing decisions include selecting between alternative airports and flights based on real-time data on road traffic and flight delays. We illustrate the application of our modal with an air cargo routing in the Michigan-Ohio road-air inter-modal network</br>
