Our objective is to identify effective triage decisions that maximize the expected number of lives saved, given the lifetime and treatment time distributions for patients and also the number of patients. We use stochastic dynamic programming to (partially) characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We propose a heuristic policy which is shown to work well by a numerical study.</br>
