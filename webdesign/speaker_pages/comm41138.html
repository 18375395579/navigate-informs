<br>Title: Investigating Airline Customers' Premium Coach Seat Purchases and Implications for Optimal Pricing</br><br>Author: Laurie Garrow, Georgia Institute of Technology, 790 Atlantic Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, laurie.garrow@ce.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stacey Mumbower, Jeffrey Newman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate airline customers?purchases of premium coach seats using online data from JetBlue's website. Behavior is influenced by the amount of the seat fee, how far in advance the ticket is purchased, the number of passengers traveling together, and load factors. Customers are between 2 and 3.3 times more likely to purchase premium coach seats when there are no window or aisle seats that can be reserved for free.</br>
