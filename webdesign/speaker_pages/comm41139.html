Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of constructing arcs in a network to minimize the cost needed to evacuate a population in the face of disaster, assuming that nature is an intelligent agent. We consider four variants where the disaster is/is not restricted to fixed locations, or when the number of evacuated people either does or does not depend on the disaster¹s location. We formulate a three-level programming for this problem, along with a finitely convergent algorithm for their solution.</br>
