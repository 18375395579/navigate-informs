Title: Simplified Control Problems for Multi-class Many-server Queueing Systems<br>Author: Gennady Shaikhet, Postdoctoral Associate, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, shaikhet@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rami Atar, Avishai Mandelbaum<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Consider parallel queueing model with several customer classes and several many-server pools, in the heavy traffic regime. Service times are exponential. Abandonments are allowed. We address two special cases: service rates are either only pool- or only class-dependent. This implies significant simplifications for the limiting controlled diffusion models, in particular, a reduction to a one dimension in the first case. We then derive asymptotically optimal policies for the queueing model.
