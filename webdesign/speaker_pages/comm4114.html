Service times are exponential. Abandonments are allowed. We address two special cases: service rates are either only pool- or only class-dependent. This implies significant simplifications for the limiting controlled diffusion models, in particular, a reduction to a one dimension in the first case. We then derive asymptotically optimal policies for the queueing model.</br>
