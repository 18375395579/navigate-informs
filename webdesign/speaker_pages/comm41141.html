<br>Title: Optimal RFID Reader Placement in a Supply Chain Network</br><br>Author: Thomas Vossen, Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, 80309-0419, United States, vossen@colorado.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diego Klabjan, Seokcheol Chang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain network where different commodities are routed from their origins to their locations, but where items may be lost as they traverse various locations. The use of RFID can reduce these losses, and we provide models to determine where to position RFID readers to capture item location or loss. The resulting models capture the trade-offs imposed by the various recourse options that are available when items are lost.</br>
