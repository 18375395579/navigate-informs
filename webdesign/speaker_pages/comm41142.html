<br>Title: The Probabilistic 1-Maximal Covering Problem on a Network with Discrete Demand Weights</br><br>Author: Jiamin Wang, Assistant Professor, Long Island University, Roth Hall 202, 720 Northern Boulevard, Brookville, NY, 11548, United States, Jiamin.Wang@liu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We investigate locating a facility on a network with uncertain demand generated from the nodes. It is assumed that demand weights are independent discrete random variables. The objective is to maximize the probability that the total demand within a given distance of the facility reaches at least a pre-selected threshold level. It is shown that the problem is NP-hard and that an optimal solution exists in a finite set of dominant points. Solution procedures are developed to solve the problem.</br>
