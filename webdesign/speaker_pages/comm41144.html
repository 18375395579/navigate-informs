The problem simultaneously considers the service selection and scheduling, traffic distribution, blocking policy, and train make-up policy. To explicitly describe the flows of services, blocks, and cars/commodities, a cyclic time-space network structure with three layers is constructed. Based on the network structure, we present a linear mixed-integer formulation. Solution method ideas are also discussed.</br>
