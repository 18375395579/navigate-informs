Title: Scheduled Service Network Design for Rail Carriers<br>Author: Endong Zhu, CIRRELT, University of Montreal, C.P. 6128, succursale Centre-ville, Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada, endong@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michel Gendreau, Teodor Gabriel Crainic<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We are addressing the service network design problem in freight rail transportation. The problem simultaneously considers the service selection and scheduling, traffic distribution, blocking policy, and train make-up policy. To explicitly describe the flows of services, blocks, and cars/commodities, a cyclic time-space network structure with three layers is constructed. Based on the network structure, we present a linear mixed-integer formulation. Solution method ideas are also discussed.
