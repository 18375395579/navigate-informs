At any period the firm can buy any amount of the commodity at the current, Markov modulated, price, or use stored?commodity paying storage cost. A strategy is a vector of levels specifying the minimal commodity amount to keep for a given price. We present a polynomial time algorithm to calculate a nearly optimal strategy as well as the value function, using, at each step, only one-dimensional optimization.</br>
