The worker productivity includes learning by doing and learning by transfer of knowledge from others. The allocation problem is composed of: a selection phase , a grouping phase and an assignment phase. At each phase, heuristic approaches are suggested. Two systems are of interest: a parallel system and a serial system.</br>
