<br>Title: Patient Care and Resource Management Optimization</br><br>Author: Monica Puertas, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Ave., ENB 118, Tampa, FL, United States of America, mpuertas@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jose Zayas-Castro, Bo Zeng, Peter Fabri</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The care of patients with multiple injuries demands a large amount of time, because most of them require total care over multiple stages and have very long length of stay, leading to extensive resource usage. The purpose of the proposed research is to integrate systems engineering methods with healthcare expertise for improving the delivery of care and the resource management, designing a well-planned treatment path to achieve the goal of safety, quality and progression.</br>
