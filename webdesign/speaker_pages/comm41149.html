Little attention has been given to conceptualize geographic access in the era of greater delivery mobilization. As a result, many outpatients encounter huge travel burden. We present several routing and scheduling models to distribute outpatient specialty care dynamically in a network. Our initial aim is to minimize patient travel distance and time.</br>
