Title: Dynamic Routing of Customers with General Delay Costs in a Multi-server Queuing System<br>Author: Serhan Ziya, University of North Carolina, 213 Smith Building CB#3260, Chapel Hill, NC, United States, ziya@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Li Ding, Kevin Glazebrook, Nilay Argon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a network of parallel heterogeneous service stations each modeled as a single server queue. Each station serves its own dedicated customers as well as generic customers who are routed from a central controller. With the objective of minimizing the long-run average waiting costs, we develop two heuristic routing policies based on dynamic programming policy iteration and Lagrangian relaxation. A numerical study demonstrates the superior performance of the Lagrangian heuristic.
