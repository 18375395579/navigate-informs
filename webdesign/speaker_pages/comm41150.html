<br>Title: Dynamic Control of Excess Wait Times in Healthcare Systems</br><br>Author: Sara Nourazari, PhD student, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA, 02115, United States of America, sara@coe.neu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Benneyan, Rifat Sipahi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Excess wait time is a common problem in many health systems. Since the demand for service is not usually constant over time, capacity decisions play an important role in controlling delayed access in healthcare and can largely influence the patient wait time. Our research investigates the value of engineering feedback control to dynamically adjust staffing levels in order to achieve any predefined performance levels, including optimal minimal cost controllers under a variety of assumptions.</br>
