Title: Modeling Traffic Incidents for Dynamic Vehicle Routing Applications<br>Author: Ali R. Guner, PhD Candidate, Wayne State University, 4815 Fourth St., Detroit, MI, 48202, United States of America, ali@aguner.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ratna Babu Chinnam, Alper E. Murat<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Non recurring incidents critically impact travel time in transportation networks. Literature mostly considers recurring congestion as the main source of travel time delay. We compare and contrast existing nonrecurring congestion delay models with data from real incidents on transportation networks. We also offer new compact incident delay models for efficient and effective representation.
