Title: Subcontracting Operations with Multiple Manufacturers and a Single Third Party<br>Author: George Vairaktarakis, Professor, Case Western Reserve University, CWRU, Cleveland, OH, United States of America, gxv5@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vernon Ning Hsu, Ke Fu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Consider a set of manufacturers who have the option to subcontract part of their workload to a third party, so as to improve their individual production cost: in-house unit production cost + unit cost at the third party + completion time cost. This time sensitivity, together with the limited capacity at 3P present an interesting optimization problem for which we provide algorithms even for the case of varying speeds for the processing of the various manufacturer workloads at the 3P facility.
