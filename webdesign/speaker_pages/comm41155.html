But could there be a single protocol that  is good for all reasonable utility functions? We first present a centralized algorithm that is an O(log n) approximation, simultaneously, for all canonical utility functions. Then we present a TCP-like protocol which achieves the same bounds. Our protocol requires per-flow state at routers; whether this is necessary is an intriguing open problem.</br>
