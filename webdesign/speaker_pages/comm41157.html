The classification terminal is a key determinant of service reliability. Performance improvement can be gained by adapting tools from manufacturing. This new approach, introduced here as “Lean Railroading,?comprises the adaptation of Lean, the Theory of Constraints (TOC) and Statistical Process Control (SPC or six sigma) to the terminal system.
