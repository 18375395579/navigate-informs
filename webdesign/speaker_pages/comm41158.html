In this talk, we present OptMeas optimization formulation that identifies the measurement sets that lead to unique flux elucidation while minimizing overall measurement cost. OptMeas utilizes incidence structure analysis, and considers both stationary and isotopically nonstationary MFA experimental conditions. OptMeas also accounts for partial isotopic measurements such as mass distributions.</br>
