Title: Improved Approximations for Orienteering with Time Windows and Without<br>Author: Nitish Korula, Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 201, N Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, nkorula2@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chandra Chekuri, Martin Pal<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problems of Orienteering, and Orienteering with Time Windows, obtaining better approximations for both. In the Orienteering problem, given an edge-weighted graph, vertices s and t, and a time limit T, the goal is to find an s-t walk of length at most T that maximizes the number of distinct vertices it visits. Orienteering with Time Windows is the generalization in which each vertex v has a time window [R(v), D(v)], and only vertices visited within their time windows are counted.
