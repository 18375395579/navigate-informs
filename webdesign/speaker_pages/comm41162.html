Title: Reducing Flight Delays by Optimizing Block-time Allocation<br>Author: Mazhar Arikan, University of Kansas, School of Business, Lawrence, KS, United States of America, mazhar@ku.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vinayak Deshpande, Milind Sohoni<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper, we develop an approach to reallocate block-times across the network of an airline and analyze the trade-off between total network arrival delay minutes and network-wide block-time budget based on a stochastic travel-time model. Using data acquired from a major U.S. airline, we construct an efficient frontier by optimally allocating block-times while considering target on-time arrival probability for each flight in the network.
