We used probability function masses to present organ motion uncertainty while utilizing the personalized utility function in the optimization objective during radiation treatment planning. Although the plans were comparable with conventional dose/dose-volume metrics, reductions of 25% and 38% in fV20 and fV30, respectively, were achieved by FPMF-based plan (p-value < 0.01).</br>
