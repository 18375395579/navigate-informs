Title: A Sustainable Model for Optimal Dynamic Allocation of Tug Boats to Oil Tankers<br>Author: Brice Assimizele, PhD student, Aalesund University College, Hus 201 Nørvegjerdet 2A, Ålesund, No, 6009, Norway, bras@hials.no<br>Coauthor(s): Johannes O. Røyset, Johan Oppen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The Norwegian Coastal Administration administers a number of vessel traffic services (VTS) centers along the Norwegian coast, one of which is located in the extreme northeast part of Norway.  The task of the operators at the VTS center in Vard?is to command a fleet of tug vessels patrolling the northern Norwegian coastline such that the risk of oil tanker drifting accidents is reduced. We propose a mix integer programming model to address the problem.
