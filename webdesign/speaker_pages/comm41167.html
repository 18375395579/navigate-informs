Title: On Best-response Bidding in Ad Auctions<br>Author: Anna Karlin, Professor, University of Washington, Box 352350, PGA 594, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, karlin@cs.washington.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: How should players bid in keyword auctions such as those used by Google, Yahoo! and MSN? We consider best-response bidding strategies for a repeated auction on a single keyword, where in each round, each player chooses some optimal bid for the next round, assuming that the other players merely repeat their previous bids. We study the convergence and robustness properties of such strategies. Most interesting among these is a best-repsonse strategy with the property that if all players use it, the bids converge to a fixed point that coincides with the equilibrium of a static game, with payments identical to those of the VCG mechanism.  We prove that convergence occurs with probability 1, and we establish bounds on the speed of convergence.  This shows that there exist natural bidding strategies in the dynamic game that lead to the equilibrium of the static game.
