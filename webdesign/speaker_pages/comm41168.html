The total cargo booked on a flight consists of many shipments with different sizes and different booking and tender patterns. Our purpose is to determine the best overbooking level taking into account the following: innfluence of show-up at departure by bookings on a flight and their characteristics; shipment size (big versus small) and different states of tender (cancelled/no-show, tendered as booked, under-tender, and over-tender) are important; and, the effect of tendered information, i.e. after tendering, a shipment has a constant show-up equal to its tender size. In this presentation we present the shipment level overbooking methodology, preliminary results of the proposed methodology, and the potential benefits from the new methodology.
