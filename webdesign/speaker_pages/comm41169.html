Snyder<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study inventory optimization for continuous-review multi-echelon distribution systems subject to supply disruptions, with Poisson customer demands under a first-come, first-served allocation policy. We develop a recursive optimization heuristic, which applies a bottom-up approach that sequentially approximates the base-stock levels of all the locations. A preliminary numerical study shows that it performs very well, reaching within 1% of optimal for most instances tested.
