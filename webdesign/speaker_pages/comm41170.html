Title: Dynamic Traffic Rerouting with Feedback Loop from Infrastructure<br>Author: Andrew Even, M.S. Candidate, Grand Valley State University, 301 W Fulton Street, Grand Rapids, MI, 49504, United States of America, akeven@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Choudhu, Charles Standridge<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In near future, intelligent transportation system will allow real time feedback to the vehicles traveling in a particular route.  In case of a distress condition in the downstream, this algorithm will compute the most cost effective route to get back to the original travel path based on the overall traffic conditions in the surrounding arterial routes.
