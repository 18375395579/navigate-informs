Title: Are Airlines Newsvendors?

We combine flight data published by BTS, with the Newsvendor framework from the Operations literature to examine the impact of the scheduled block time on on-time arrival performance. Results show that airlines systematically under-schedule flights, and do not adjust  service levels based on the time of the day, month, or origin and destination airport congestion
