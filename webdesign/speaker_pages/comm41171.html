<br>Title: Are Airlines Newsvendors? Or, An Empirical Investigation of Airline Flight Schedules</br><br>Author: Vinayak Deshpande, Purdue University, 4024 Rawls Hall, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, vinayak@exchange.purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mazhar Arikan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Airline flight delays have come under increased scrutiny lately, with on-time performance at its worst level in 13 years in June 2007. We combine flight data published by BTS, with the Newsvendor framework from the Operations literature to examine the impact of the scheduled block time on on-time arrival performance. Results show that airlines systematically under-schedule flights, and do not adjust  service levels based on the time of the day, month, or origin and destination airport congestion</br>
