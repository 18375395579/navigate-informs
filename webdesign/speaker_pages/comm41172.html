In addition to dedicated servers at each station, the system is equipped with a fixed number of flexible servers that are available to be assigned to any station. We show in the two-station case that transition monotone optimal policies minimize average inventory holding costs. We discuss heuristics based on the two-server model that reduce average holding costs significantly.</br>
