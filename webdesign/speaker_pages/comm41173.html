Title: A Sustainable Continuous Review Inventory Control Model<br>Author: Dincer Konur, Assistant Professor, Missouri University of Science and Technology, 206 EMSE, 600 W. 14th Street, Rolla, MO, 65409, United States of America, konurd@mst.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Schaefer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study formulates a bi-objective continuous review inventory control system where expected costs and carbon emissions are minimized. We propose Pareto Front approximation and min-max formulation as solution approaches. Numerical studies demonstrate the effects of demand variance and lead time on carbon emissions. Furthermore, we discuss that emissions can be reduced without significant cost increase by integrating sustainability in continuous review inventory control systems.
