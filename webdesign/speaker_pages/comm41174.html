Title: Simultaneously Determining Entry/Egress Points and Time Allocations for UAV Grid Routing<br>Author: Michael Moskal, PhD Student, University at Buffalo (SUNY), 342 Bell Hall, Department of Industrial & Systems Eng, Amherst, NY, 14260, United States of America, mmoskal@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rajan Batta<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this work we propose a method for simultaneously determining the best entry/egress points and the time allocations to maximize information gain on UAV surveillance missions.  Given a route, each grid can be decomposed into a network and a series of routing and algorithms and heuristics can estimate the expected information gain.  A math model is then used to determine the entry/egress points and the amount of time that should be spent in each grid to maximize information gain.
