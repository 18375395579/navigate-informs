Consider electric power markets where upper-level variables choose which generators operate in a given time period to satisfy desirable properties (e.g., minimum profit conditions).  The lower-level variables relate to the production levels of the active generators, the loads and locational prices of the network.  We examine new Benders-like methods for solving these difficult problems.</br>
