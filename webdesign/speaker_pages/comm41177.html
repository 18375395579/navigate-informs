Title: Computational Bundling for Auctions<br>Author: Tuomas Sandholm, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, United States of America, sandholm@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christian Kroer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Optimal multi-item auctions impractically favor some bidders and randomize. Instead, we study a revenue-enhancement approach - bundling - in VCG. The prior can be doubly exponential. Instead, many applications have an inaccurate point prior. We adopt this model, and prove robustness to inaccuracy. Then we present a branch-and-bound framework for optimal bundling. We introduce techniques for branching, upper and lower bounding, and lazy bounding. Experiments show dramatic improvement over CPLEX.
