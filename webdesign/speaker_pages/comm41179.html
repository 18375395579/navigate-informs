<br>Title: Dynamic Modeling of Network Expansion ?The Case of European Natural Gas Infrastructure</br><br>Author: Franziska Holz, DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr. 58, Berlin, 10117, Germany, fholz@diw.de</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop a complementarity model of the European natural gas market and network, with a two-stage structure of successive imports and wholesale trade that use the same pipeline network in Europe. Each country is taken as one node, and there are aggregated pipeline and LNG links between the countries. The gas flows along arcs in a directed graph that is integrated in the market players?problem. We then introduce investments in the constrained transport links, with a NPV optimization approach.</br>
