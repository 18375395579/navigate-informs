Title: Newsvendor with Risk Hedging -- Order Quantity and Efficient Frontier<br>Author: David Yao, Columbia University, Dept. of IEOR, New York, NY, United States of America, yao@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Liao Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a newsvendor model with the demand rate being a function of a market index (modelled as geometric Brownian motion), in addition to the usual Gaussian noise. We solve a Markowitz-type mean-variance problem with a hedging strategy, in addition to the one-time order-quantity decision; and discuss the related notions of efficient frontier.
