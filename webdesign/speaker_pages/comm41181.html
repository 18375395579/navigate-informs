Title: Exchange Market Mechanisms without Money<br>Author: Nima Haghpanah, PhD Student, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, nima.haghpanah@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Vahab Mirrokni, Zeinab Abbassi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper considers a set of agents who wish to obtain a set of items, and have a set of items to offer to others. An exchange market mechanism specifies for each agent a subset of items to give away, and a subset of items to receive. Each agent would like to maximize the number of items he receives. Our goal is to design truthful mechanisms to maximize social welfare. This problem is a generalization of the kidney exchange problem, and is motivated by barter exchange websites on the Internet.
