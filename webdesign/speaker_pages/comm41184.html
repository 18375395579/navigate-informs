Title: Incorporating Congestion in Designing Preventive Healthcare Facility Networks<br>Author: Yue Zhang, PhD Candidate, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC, H3A 1G5, Canada, yue.zhang3@mail.mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman, Vedat Verter<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The problem of locating an undetermined number of preventive healthcare facilities to maximize participation is proposed. Each facility is an M/M/1 queue, and each customer patronizes the facility with the minimal expected total time (travel time plus the expected time customers spend at the facility). Facilities must achieve a minimum workload requirement. Four heuristics are proposed and compared. A real life application (breast cancer screening centers in Montreal) is examined and analyzed.
