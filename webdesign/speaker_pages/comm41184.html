Each facility is an M/M/1 queue, and each customer patronizes the facility with the minimal expected total time (travel time plus the expected time customers spend at the facility). Facilities must achieve a minimum workload requirement. Four heuristics are proposed and compared. A real life application (breast cancer screening centers in Montreal) is examined and analyzed.</br>
