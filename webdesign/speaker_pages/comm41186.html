We propose that the benefits of a reduction in social loafing outweigh the expected efficiency gains from pooling, which are commonly predicted by queuing theory. Using an Emergency Department’s patient-level data (N = 233,781) over 4 years, we find that patients?lengths of stay were longer when the ED’s work system had pooled demand as opposed to dedicated demand streams.</br>
