Title: A Tabu Search-based Heuristic Method for a Multi-objective Bus Stop Location Problem<br>Author: Sha Mamun, Graduate Student, University of Connecticut, 261 Glenbrook Road, Unit 3037, Storrs, CT, 06269-3037, United States of America, msm08014@engr.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Lownes<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A multi-objective bus stop location problem is presented to optimize service efficiency by considering service accessibility and trip connectivity. A tabu search algorithm for solving this problem is proposed. The problem consists in identifying optimal stop locations, assigning buses to the routes and allocation of trip demands from each stop to all origin-destination pairs.
