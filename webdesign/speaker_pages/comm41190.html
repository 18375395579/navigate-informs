Title: Multi-step Control in Semiconductor Manufacturing<br>Author: Joe Qin, University of Texas, 1 University Station C0400, Austin, TX, United States, qin@che.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erhan Kutanoglu, Clare Schoene<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing processes consist of hundreds of discrete steps, and upon completion measurements are made to ensure electrical specifications are met.  Current manufacturing technology controls individual processing steps but does directly control electrical parameter values.  A multi-step algorithm that coordinates lower level controllers while addressing the optimality of the entire process is proposed.  The algorithm uses a partial least squares model and available data to predict outputs and determine optimal set points for the subsequent processing steps.
