<br>Title: Stochastic Analysis of Ordered Median Problems</br><br>Author: Zvi Drezner, Professor, California State University, Department of ISDS, Fullerton, CA, 92834, United States of America, zdrezner@fullerton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stefan Nickel, Hans-Peter Ziegler</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Many location problems can be expressed as ordered median objective. In this paper we investigate the ordered median objective when the demand points are generated in a circle. We find the mean and variance of the k'th distance from the center of the circle and the correlation matrix between all pairs of ordered distances. By applying these values, we calculate the mean and variance of any ordered median objective and the correlation coefficient between two ordered median objectives.</br>
