Title: Random Distance Parameters; Their Analytic Computation and Application in Airtanker System Analysis<br>Author: Francis Greulich, Professor, College of Forest Resources, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, greulich@u.washington.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Forest engineers have long had access to innovative analytical procedures for the computation of statistical moments for the random distance from discrete points to random locations on line segments and over polygonal regions. It is now possible to rapidly calculate exact moments for the random distance along and between line segments, and the random distance within and between polygonal regions. Possible applications to airtanker system evaluation and design have motivated these advances.
