<br>Title: Extremal Information Structures of the First Price Auction</br><br>Author: Dirk Bergemann, Douglass and Marian Campbell Professor of Economics, Yale University, 30, Hillhouse Avenue, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States of America, dirk.bergemann@yale.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the effect of information on the equilibrium behavior in first-price auctions. We solve for the Bayes correlated equilibria (BCE) of the first-price sealed-bid auction with private values. The set of BCE correspond to the set of pairs of information structures and Bayesian equilibria. We use the duality to back out information structures that support equilibria on the frontier of bidders' payoffs and revenue.</br>
