Title: Integrated Supply Chain Network Design: Location, Transportation, Routing and Inventory Decisions<br>Author: Mingjun Xia, Arizona State University, 1718 S Jentilly Lane, APT 204, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, Mingjun.Xia@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ronald Askin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a novel model to simultaneously optimize location, allocation, transportation, inventory and routing decisions in a stochastic multi-product supply chain system. Each producer provides a unique product. Each retailer has independent, random demand for multiple products. Consolidation and distribution facilities may be constructed to reduce shipment costs and increase the frequency of economical shipments. Heuristics are developed to solve large-size scale instances of the problem.
