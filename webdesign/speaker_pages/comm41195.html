Title: Discrete Hit-and-run for Sampling from Arbitrary Subsets of Integer Hyper-rectangles<br>Author: Archis Ghate, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering,, Box 352650, Seattle, WA, 98115, United States of America, archis@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Baumert, Yanfang Shen, Seksan Kiatsupaibul, Robert Smith, Zelda Zabinsky<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a point from a distribution p over a subset S of an integer hyper-rectangle, both defined through oracles. We turn to Markov Chain Monte Carlo, where we execute an ergodic Markov chain that converges to p so that the distribution of the point delivered after sufficiently many steps is arbitrarily close to p. Specifically, we propose a discrete variant of hit-and-run, a well-known Euclidean domain Markov chain.
