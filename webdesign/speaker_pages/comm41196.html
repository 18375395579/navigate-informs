Title: Minimum Vehicle Routing with a Common Deadline<br>Author: Viswanath Nagarajan, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, viswanat@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): R Ravi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the following vehicle routing problem: given n vertices in a metric space, a specified depot vertex r, and a length bound D, find a minimum cardinality set of r-paths that covers all vertices, such that each path has length at most D. We consider a linear relaxation for this problem that can be solved approximately. The integrality gap of this relaxation is shown to be upper bounded by a constant in tree metrics and by min{log n, log D} in general.
