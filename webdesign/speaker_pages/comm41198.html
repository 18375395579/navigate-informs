Title: Multi-task Learning with Heterogeneous Task Relatedness<br>Author: Yada Zhu, IBM, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, yzhu@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In many applications of multi-task learning, the tasks form multiple groups, and the relatedness between tasks varies. To address this problem, we propose a general framework, which partitions the input features into 2 sets based on their characteristics, and imposes different constraints on their coefficient vectors to accommodate task grouping.
