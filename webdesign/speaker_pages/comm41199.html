Title: Threshold RM with Limited Forecasting<br>Author: Wei Wang, PROS, Inc., 3100 Main St., Houston, TX, United States of America, Weiwang@pros.com<br>Coauthor(s): Tom Gorin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a threshold control based RM method having limited forecasting. Starting with user provided initial values, the thresholds are adjusted across both departures and DCPs to approximate user specified month/market load factor goals.  Empirical comparisons to FCFS and EMSRb under priceable, hybrid and yieldable demand scenarios are also provided.
