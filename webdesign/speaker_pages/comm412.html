<br>Title: Integrated Network Design and Scheduling Problems with Release Dates</br><br>Author: Sarah Nurre, Research Assistant, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street CII 5015, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, nurres@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Sharkey</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating resources to process tasks, each with a release date, that correspond to installing components into a network. The main motivating application of this is repairing or reinstalling damaged infrastructure components back into the network after an extreme event.  We provide an online optimization heuristic framework for these problems that is motivated by network flow optimality conditions and dispatching rules for scheduling problems.</br>
