Title: Network Design for Emergency Response<br>Author: Jianing Zhi, University of Alabama, 300 Alston Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487, United States of America, jzhi@crimson.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Burcu Keskin, Sharif Melouk<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate a multi-period ambulance location planning problem to minimize total cost while maintaining acceptable response times. The network consists of supply centers, responder and incident locations, and hospitals. We propose two models: 1) all incidents require service in the period in which they occur, and 2) incident servicing delays are allowed but with penalty. Through experimentation, we compare these two models in terms of service quality, response time, and cost.
