The network consists of supply centers, responder and incident locations, and hospitals. We propose two models: 1) all incidents require service in the period in which they occur, and 2) incident servicing delays are allowed but with penalty. Through experimentation, we compare these two models in terms of service quality, response time, and cost.</br>
