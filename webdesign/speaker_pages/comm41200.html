Title: A Quadratic C0 Interior Penalty Method for the Displacement Obstacle Problem of Clamped Plates<br>Author: Yi Zhang, Graduate Student, Louisiana State University, 103 Lockett Hall, Department of Mathematics, LSU, Baton Rouge, LA, 70803, United States of America, yzhang24@math.lsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Li-yeng Sung, Hongchao Zhang, Susanne Brenner<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The displacement obstacle problem of clamped Kirchhoff plates is an example of a fourth order variational inequality whose numerical analysis is more subtle than that of second order variational inequalities. In this talk we will introduce C0 interior penalty methods for this problem. Both error estimates and numerical results will be discussed. This is joint work with Susanne Brenner, Li-yeng Sung and Hongchao Zhang.
