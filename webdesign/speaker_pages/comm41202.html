<br>Title: Managing Inventory of Perishable Items</br><br>Author: Opher Baron, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S3E6, Canada, Opher.Baron@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Perry, Oded Berman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We generalize the traditional (s,S) models to include cycle's stopping times that are independent of the content level.  This models perishable items that arrive in batches, have the same exponential or deterministic shelflife, and are consumed by a Compound Poisson demand.  Assuming zero leadtime, we optimize the order-up-to-level to minimize cost.</br>
