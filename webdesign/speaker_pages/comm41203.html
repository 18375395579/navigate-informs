Title: Identifying and Prioritizing nth-order Organizational Congruence Gaps in Socio Technical Systems<br>Author: Mary Helander, IBM Research, T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10603, United States of America, helandm@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk, we examine the concept of a gap in organizational congruence by extending the concept of a missing coordination link between pairs of individuals.  Specially, we define the concept of an nth order gap, that occurs when a direct link does not appear to exist, but where a path of length n+1 indicates possible coordiation through indirect brokership.  An approach for identifying and prioritizing nth order gaps is presented.
