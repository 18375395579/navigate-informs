<br>Title: L-SOUP: Location of Socially Undesirable Premises</br><br>Author: Vladimir Marianov, Department of Electrical Engineering, The Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile, marianov@ing.puc.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): H. A. Eiselt</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We locate capacitated landfills and transfer stations. Waste from any origin can go to a landfill either directly or through a transfer station, where it is compacted and loaded on larger trucks. All garbage disposal needs of a region are fulfilled, while pollution effects over the population are constrained. Pollution from a landfill reaches a distance that depends on its capacity. We present preliminary computational tests.</br>
