Title: Analyzing Scrip Systems<br>Author: Kristine Johnson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ORC, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, krisdj@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peng Sun, David Simchi-Levi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Scrip systems provide a non-monetary trade economy for exchange of services. We model a scrip system as a stochastic game and study system design issues. We show the optimality of one particular rule to maximize social welfare. We also investigate the optimal number of scrips to issue under this rule. We show there is an upper bound on the number of scrips allowed in the system, which increases with the discount factor as well as the ratio between the benefit and cost of service.
