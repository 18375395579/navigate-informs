Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, belobaba@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Our analysis of US airline data indicates significant cost convergence between the Network Legacy Carriers (NLCs) and Low Cost Carriers (LCCs), in terms of labor unit costs in particular.  While NLCs have improved cost efficiency through labor cost reductions and longer stage length flying, LCC labor unit costs continue to increase as these airlines mature.</br>
