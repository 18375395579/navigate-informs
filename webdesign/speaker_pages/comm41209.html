Title: Placement of Two Finite-size Facilities in an Existing Layout with the Rectilinear Distance Metric<br>Author: Rakesh Nagi, Professor, University at Buffalo, 438 Bell Hall, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, nagi@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ketan Date<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the optimal placement of two finite size rectangular facilities, in presence of existing rectangular facilities, and rectilinear travel. Three types of interactions are considered between boundary I/O points of: (1) new facilities and existing facilities; (2) pairs of existing facilities; and (3) two new facilities. We identify the candidates for optimal placement of the two new facilities which will minimize the sum of the weighted distances between the interacting facilities.
