Three types of interactions are considered between boundary I/O points of: (1) new facilities and existing facilities; (2) pairs of existing facilities; and (3) two new facilities. We identify the candidates for optimal placement of the two new facilities which will minimize the sum of the weighted distances between the interacting facilities.</br>
