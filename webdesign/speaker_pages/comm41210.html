<br>Title: Information concealing games</br><br>Author: Saswati Sarkar, Associate Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 200 S. 33rd St., Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, swati@seas.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eitan Altman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a system with two players that have different information about the state of the system. Each player needs to chose the amount of information it reveals about the system state to   the other player subject to certain system constraints.     We show that the decision problems for the entities can be formulated as a signaling game, and provide  policies that attain the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of this game.</br>
