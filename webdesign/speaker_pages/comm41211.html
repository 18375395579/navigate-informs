Inbound calls arrive as an exogenous stream of customers with impatience, while outbound calls are modeled as an infinite queue of jobs, waiting to be processed. The goal is to serve inbound calls subject to service level constraints while keeping the outbound throughput rate at a desired level. We show that a logarithmic safety staffing is sufficient to meet these objectives.</br>
