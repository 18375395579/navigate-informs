<br>Title: Robust Pricing for Networks with Demand Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Lauren Gardner, Graduate Research Assistant, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1761, ECJ Hall Suite 6.2, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, lmgardner@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Duthie, Avinash Unnikrishnan, S. Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Robust pricing is of interest due to the uncertainties that arise in networks, specifically demand uncertainty. We will use a stochastic optimization model to determine optimal link tolls for a given network, and provide some insight into the robustness of this pricing scheme by examining UE preformance under various origin-demand matrices.</br>
