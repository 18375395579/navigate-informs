Title: Time Dependent Vehicle Routing Subject to Perturbations<br>Author: Tom Van Woensel, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, 5612 AZ, Netherlands, t.v.woensel@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Ola Gabali, Ton de Kok<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Vehicle routing problems are extensively studied due to the realistic value such problems have with regards to distribution logistics. This paper extends the existing models by incorporating random disruptions, which depict situations where there are delays at the customers. We find robust solutions that have a good ability to absorb these disruptions.
