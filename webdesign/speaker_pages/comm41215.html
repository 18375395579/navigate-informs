Title: Design of a Distribution Network<br>Author: Anton Kleywegt, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Industrial Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, anton@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jinpyo Lee, Amy Ward<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the design of a distribution network in which a less-than-truckload carrier transports shipments between many origins and destinations using several crossdocks.  We describe a continuous approximation type approach that better captures the trade-off between the number of crossdocks that serves origins and destinations and the transportation distances than a widely used approach.  We demonstrate our method with various instances.
