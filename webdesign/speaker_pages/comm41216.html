Title: Multi-server Systems with Adaptive Server Behavior<br>Author: Mohammad Delasay, Alberta School of Business, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G2R6, Canada, delasays@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Armann Ingolfsson, Bora Kolfal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate service rates in the Calgary EMS system and show that service rates decrease with the number of busy ambulances. Then, we model and analyze systems in which service rates change with “load?(the number of busy servers) and “overwork?(the number of users served in the current full busy period). We demonstrate how ignoring adaptive server behavior results in inconsistencies between the planned and realized performance.
