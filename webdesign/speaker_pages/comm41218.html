We simulate the competitive dynamics when both airlines use an elasticity forecast derived from the observation of their own bookings and an exact optimization algorithm disregarding competition. We show that for continuous fares the game theoretic model has a unique, pure strategy, sub game-perfect Nash equilibrium. Both the simulation and the equilibrium show that for larger capacities prices will spiral down.</br>
