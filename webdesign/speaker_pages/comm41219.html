Title: The Effect of Periodic Discounts on Stochastic Inventory Control<br>Author: Mehmet Gumus, Assistant Professor, McGill, Canada, mehmet@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyun-Soo Ahn, Phil Kaminsky<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the joint pricing and inventory control problem for a single product whose demand distribution in each period is determined by both current and past prices. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and conduct a computational study to illustrate the effect of various parameters on the optimal policy.
