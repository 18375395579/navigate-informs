Title: Inbound Logistics Scheduling with Milk Runs with Limited Unloading Capacity<br>Author: Xiangtong Qi, Assistant Professor, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Department of Industrial Engineering and, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, ieemqi@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Jinwen Ou, Chung-Yee Lee<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A 3PL company uses a milkrun system to pick up components from suppliers to an automotive maker.  Suppliers are clustered into subsets where each subset is visited by one truck run.  One bottleneck of the system is the unloading docks at the warehouse where trucks are waiting for unloading.  We formulate the problem as a scheduling problem with unloading servers and develop algorithms to improve system efficiency.
