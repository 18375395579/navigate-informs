Suppliers are clustered into subsets where each subset is visited by one truck run.  One bottleneck of the system is the unloading docks at the warehouse where trucks are waiting for unloading.  We formulate the problem as a scheduling problem with unloading servers and develop algorithms to improve system efficiency.
