Title: Facility Relayout to Alleviate Congestion<br>Author: Rakesh Nagi, Professor, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, 438 Bell Hall, University at Buffalo (SUNY), Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, nagi@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rajan Batta, Min Zhang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: As product mix and volumes change, certain areas of the manufacturing   facility become congested. Some of this congestion can be alleviated by rerouting flows. However, a manager needs to know when to relayout the facility to not only have reduced material handling (traditional objective function) but also reduced congestion. We present facility layout models that explicitly consider flow congestion.
