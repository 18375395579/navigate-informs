Box 9043, Mayaguez, PR, 00981, Puerto Rico, hcarlo@uprm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yavuz Bozer<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine the optimal shape of a rectangular cross-dock and the best door locations relative to travel distances. Also, several properties of optimal outbound trailer-to-door assignments are identified for certain types of flows. Results for some properties pertaining to “alternating doors?assignments, and “volatile?and “narrow range?trailers are presented.
