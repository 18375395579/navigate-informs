<br>Title: Target Oriented Optimization in Inventory Management</br><br>Author: Zhuoyu Long, NUS Business School, Singapore, longzhuoyu@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lucy Gongtao Chen, Georgia Perakis, Melvyn Sim</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this study we investigate the impact of target on both one-period and multi-period inventory management problems. We develop target-oriented decision criteria to model the effect of target. For the one-period (newsvendor) problem, the result from our theoretical model is consistent with experimental findings. For the multi-period problem, we incorporate the financing decisions, and report favorable computational results for using targets in regulating uncertain consumptions over time.</br>
