Title: Delay Effects on Patient Care<br>Author: Carri Chan, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, Uris 410, New York, NY, United States of America, cwchan@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vivek Farias<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Most queueing models assume that the service requirements of a job are independent of the state of the queue upon its arrival. In a healthcare setting, this assumption is equivalent to ignoring the effects of delay experienced by a patient awaiting care. This work sets out to understand these delay issues from an operational perspective. We consider how to incorporate these measured delayed effects into a queueing model and characterize approximations to various quantities of interest.
