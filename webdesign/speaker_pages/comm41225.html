We develop a quasi-birth-and-death model of a queueing system in which service rates change with the system load (fraction of busy servers) and overwork (number of users served). We demonstrate that ignoring adaptive server behavior in staffing can result in inconsistencies between planned and realized performance and can lead to unstable, suboptimal, or oscillatory staffing.</br>
