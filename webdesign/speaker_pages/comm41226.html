Title: Internet Service Resource Optimization<br>Author: Andrew Vakhutinsky, Akamai Technologies, 8 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, avakhuti@akamai.com<br>Coauthor(s): Marcelo Torres<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe our work-in-progress on an optimization model to minimize the cost of resource usage by dynamically redirecting traffic in response to varying demand levels.  We discuss the common structure used to price resource utilization per deployed location.  We conclude by describing our solution approach to solving a large-scale problem to manage resource costs across a billing period.
