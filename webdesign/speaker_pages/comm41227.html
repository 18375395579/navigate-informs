Title: Striving for Social Status<br>Author: Greg Stoddard, Northwestern University, 2133 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, gregS@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rachel Kranton, Nicole Immorlica<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a network of agents producing a positional good; an agent’s utility for the good is a function of both his intrinsic value for the good and his status, or production level relative to his neighbors. We show that the set of Nash equilibria of our game form a complete lattice. We then study the effects of status and network structure on society. We find that production increases and welfare decreases with status effects. Network structure can have arbitrary impacts on both quantities.
