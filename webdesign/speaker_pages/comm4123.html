Title: Scheduling Power Generation of a Wind Farm based on Data-driven Models<br>Author: Zijun Zhang, Assistant Professor, City University of Hong Kong, Rm P6600, 6/F, Academic 1, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, zijzhang@cityu.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Kusiak<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Scheduling a wind farm in the presence of uncertain wind speed conditions is studied.Scheduling models are constructed by incorporating mathematical programming and data mining.A migrated particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to solve the scheduling models.Insights into the operation of wind farms are discovered.
