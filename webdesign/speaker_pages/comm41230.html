Title: Energy Cost and Availability Considerations in Cloud Services Composition<br>Author: Parijat Dube, IBM, TJ Watson Research Center, Hawthorne, NY, United States of America, pdube@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Compute service provider has the flexibility to use its own private nodes or use nodes from public domain when composing services. However there are cost and availability concerns associated with both private nodes and public nodes. The goal is to construct compute services which satisfy end-to-end delay requirements of a job while minimizing cost and maintaining reliability. We propose simple heuristics and their empirical verification.
