Title: Altruistic Utility Functions for Joint Decisions<br>Author: Ralph Keeney, Research Professor, Duke University, 101 Lombard St., #704W, San Francisco, CA, 94111, United States of America, keeney@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Bell<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Altruistic joint decisions occur when individuals each have a preference to please the others involved.  We define primitive utility functions and altruistic utility functions for each individual. Given reasonable assumptions, the group altruistic utility function is additive over the individual’s altruistic utility functions and multiplicative over their primitive utility functions.
