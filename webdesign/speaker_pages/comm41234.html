<br>Title: Use of Telemetry in Stochastic Routing</br><br>Author: Amit Verma, University of Iowa, W244 John Pappajohn Bus Bldg, Iowa City, IA, United States of America, amit-verma@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ann M. Campbell</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Telemetry units can be used to gauge inventory levels at customers. Having  these readings can help prevent stockouts and unnecessary deliveries. We  present a model for the problem of where to place a limited number of  telemetry units to minimize routing costs. We model the customers without  telemetry as having a predetermined delivery frequency but allow the  delivery dates for telemetry customers to vary according to realizations of  usage. We will present a heuristic and computational results.</br>
