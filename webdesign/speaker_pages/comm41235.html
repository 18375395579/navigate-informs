Title: Optimizing a Worldwide Maintenance and Logistics Support Network<br>Author: Dr Doug Popken, Systems View, 2127 Mountain Maple Ave, Highlands Ranch, CO, United States of America, dpopken@systemsview.com<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Roderick<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This presentation describes a decision support system that will model the performance of certain fielded military IT systems.  The model will allow managers to assess alternative support scenarios with respect to a set of performance-based logistics criteria.  The problem is difficult, requiring simultaneous optimization of maintenance labor and inventory levels.  Problem complexity led us to an approach based on simulation-optimization.
