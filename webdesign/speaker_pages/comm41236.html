Title: Berth and Quay Crane Scheduling: A Multi-objective Formulation<br>Author: Michail Golias, Graduate Research Assistant, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rutgers University, 623 Bowser Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, golias@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Maria Boile, Sotiris Theofanis<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A formulation for simultaneous berth and quay crane scheduling with multiple objectives is presented. A genetic algorithm based heuristic is proposed for solving the resulting problem. We consider the minimization of costs from not meeting agreed (un)loading vessel performance, waiting and handling, and tardiness of completion of service.
