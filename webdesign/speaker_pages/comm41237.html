Title: Execution Cost Approximation for LTL Load Plans<br>Author: Yang Zhang, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, yzhang@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Erera, Martin Savelsbergh<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of determining an approximation of the true execution cost of a load plan for an LTL carrier.  We first determine freight consolidations in time and matching of trailers using an integer programming model.  Next, we construct driver tours or use purchased transportation to cover all dispatches while minimizing total cost.  Column generation approaches are developed for this problem.
