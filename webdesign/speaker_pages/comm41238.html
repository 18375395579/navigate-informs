It is inspired by the class of inventory games that arises from inventory situations with temporary discounts (Toledo, 2002) and contains the class of inventory cost games (Meca et al., 2003, 2004). It is shown that p-additive games are totally balanced. The modified SOC-rule is proposed as a core-allocation for p-additive games.</br>
