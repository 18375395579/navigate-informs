Title: Meeting Waiting Time Targets in Emergency Departments<br>Author: Rene Bekker, VU University Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1081a, Amsterdam, Netherlands, r.bekker@vu.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Paulien Koeleman, Sandjai Bhulai<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Timely access to Emergency Departments avoids patients abandoning and ambulance rerouting. The time window depends on levels of urgency and is decided upon during the triage process. At treatment completions, ED’s must prioritize patient types with different level of urgency that comply with overall waiting time targets. Due to performance in terms of tail distributions of waiting times, such patient scheduling problems are complex. This is addressed by using new techniques in an MDP framework.
