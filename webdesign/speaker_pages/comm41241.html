Multiple RMAs with setup time can be selected to resume the processing speed of machine. The objective is to minimize makespan. We reduce the problem with k-RMAs to a k-way partitioning problem, which is shown to be NP-hard. Bounds on the number of RMAs are examined and a fast heuristic is proposed. Numerical studies are implemented to verify the performances.</br>
