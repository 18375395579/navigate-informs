<br>Title: Robust Optimization of Internal Transports in a Parcel-sorting-center</br><br>Author: Brigitte Werners, Professor, Ruhr-University Bochum, Fac of Economics and Management, Bochum, NR, 44780, Germany, or@rub.de</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This contribution demonstrates considerable reduction of internal transports in one of the Deutsche Post World Net’s main parcel-sorting-centers by the robust solution of a modified three-dimensional linear assignment model. The suggested mathematical model minimizes necessary manual transportation effort by assignment modifications. Additionally, it takes into account specific characteristics and requirements of the parcel-sorting center.</br>
