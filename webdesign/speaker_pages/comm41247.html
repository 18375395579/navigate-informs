Title: Optimizing Emergency Room Personnel Resources<br>Author: Chin-I Lin, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, cindylin@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Murray Côt?, Elif Akcali<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We examine the personnel capacity planning problem for Emergency Room (ER) with two classes of patients and two types of health care teams, which have different processing capabilities and patient class - dependent service rates. We model the ER as a preemptive priority queuing system and develop approximations to compute the patient’s average system time. We then incorporate this into a network flow formulation to determine the optimal personnel capacity over a finite planning horizon.
