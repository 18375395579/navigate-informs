<br>Title: Slow-server Problem in Many-server Heavy Traffic with Non-exponential Service Times</br><br>Author: Tolga Tezcan, University of Illinois, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 117 Transportation Building, 104 South Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, ttezcan@uiuc.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the slow server problem. We assume that service times have a certain phase-type distribution. Specifically, service time of a server is assumed to have an exponential distribution with rate mu_i with probability p_i. Specific values of the parameters depend on the server pool the server belongs to. We show that a static priority policy is asymptotically optimal in many-server heavy-traffic.</br>
