Title: A Regime Switching Model for the Optimal Intervention of a Central Bank in the Exchange Rate Market<br>Author: Luz Rocio Sotomayor, University of Alberta, 632 Central Academic Building, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2G1, Canada, rsotomayor@math.ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Abel Cadenillas<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider an exchange rate market with different regimes generated by the conditions of the monetary fundamentals. Specifically, we model the exchange rate as a geometric BM with parameters modulated by an observable Markov chain. Under this setup, we solve the problem of a Central Bank that selects the intervention strategy that minimizes the total cost of keeping the exchange rate as close as possible to a given target, by using stochastic impulse control with regime switching techniques.
