Suppose there are two pairs of players playing two independent ruin games. It is possible that a player in one pair forms a coalition with a player in the other pair so as to reduce the risk of ruin for both of them. The paper analyzes such risk sharing possibilities among different combinations of players, and looks for stable coalitions. The results can be extended to more pairs of players.</br>
