Title: A Nash Equilibrium Method to Control Plug-in Electric Vehicle Charging with Wind Integration<br>Author: Xiaomin Xi, The Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, xi.12@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ramteen Sioshansi, Vincenzo Marano<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We apply a decentralized method using Nash Equilibrium to control plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging so as to reduce the negative effect of wind uncertainty. A economic dispatch model and a cost minimization problem are solved iteratively, in which SO sends scenario-based prices to a load aggregator (LA) that represents PEV owners, and LA submits bids by minimizing expected charging cost plus a penalty term. Convergence is assured under certain rules but is not necessarily social optimum.
