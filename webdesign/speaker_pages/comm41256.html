A economic dispatch model and a cost minimization problem are solved iteratively, in which SO sends scenario-based prices to a load aggregator (LA) that represents PEV owners, and LA submits bids by minimizing expected charging cost plus a penalty term. Convergence is assured under certain rules but is not necessarily social optimum.</br>
