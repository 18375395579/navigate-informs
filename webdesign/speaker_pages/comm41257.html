Title: A Unifying Framework on Day-to-Day Traffic Dynamics<br>Author: Fan Yang, ESRI, Inc., 380 New York Street, Redlands, CA, 92373, United States, fyang@esri.com<br>Coauthor(s): Bin Ran<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This study proposed a unifying framework to model drivers' day-to-day route choice behavior, especially under the condition that drivers can only access limited information and exhibit incomplete rationality. The behavior rules are given such that the day-to-day traffic flow may converge to user equilibrium, stochastic equilibrium, system optimal and bounded user equilibrium.
