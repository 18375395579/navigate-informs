<br>Title: Cyclic Distribution Strategies for an Inventory Routing Problem</br><br>Author: Orsan Ozener, Ozyegin University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Istanbul, Turkey, orsan.ozener@ozyegin.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ali Ekici, Gultekin Kuyzu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a variant of inventory routing problem where a set of customers with deterministic and continuous demand is replenished from a central depot by routing a fleet of capacitated delivery vehicles. Assuming a cyclic distribution policy where the proposed delivery schedule is repeated with a given frequency, we propose three solution approaches and test them on a set of randomly generated instances in terms of solution quality and solution time.</br>
