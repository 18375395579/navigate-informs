Title: Service Interruptions in Large-scale Service Systems<br>Author: Guodong Pang, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, gp2224@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ward Whitt<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Large-scale service systems are appealing because they combine high quality of service with high efficiency, as revealed by many-server heavy-traffic limits in the quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) regime. However, this confluence of quality and efficiency is not achieved without risk. We quantify the impact of system-wide service interruptions via heavy-traffic limits, some of which require the M_1 topology.
