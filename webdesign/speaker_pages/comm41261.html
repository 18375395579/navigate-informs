For each node only interval estimate of its weight is known. The problem is to find the “minimax regret?covering location, i.e. to minimize worst case loss in objective function because a location decision is made without knowing the actual weights at nodes. We present the algorithm for this problem on a general network. We also consider two special cases, when the solution algorithm is polynomial.</br>
