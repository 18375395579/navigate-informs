Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Route 134, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, zhangbo@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter van de Ven, Angela Schoergendorfer</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a novel Markov chain model to describe the (distributed) data backup process and analyze its stability conditions and stationary behavior. Then we study how to choose a backup scheduling policy that strikes the right balance between performing frequent backups to improve data safety and reducing backup costs.</br>
