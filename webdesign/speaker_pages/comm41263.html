Title: Static and Dynamic Structural Symmetry Breaking<br>Author: Justin Pearson, Senior Lecturer, Uppsala University, Department of Information Technology, Box 337, SE-751 05, Uppsala, Sweden, justin.pearson@it.uu.se<br>Coauthor(s): Pascal Van Hentenryck, Meinolf Sellmann, Pierre Flener<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We reconsider the idea of structural symmetry breaking. We show that dynamic dominance checks have a static counterpart: there exists a set of constraints that can be posted at the root node and that break all pairwise variable and value symmetries. Moreover, static and dynamic symmetry breaking coincide for static variable and value orderings. This is the first time that static symmetry breaking has been shown capable of breaking variable and value symmetries at the same time.
