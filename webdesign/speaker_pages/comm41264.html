Carlo</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The significant growth in volumes of containers being transshipped puts a strain on all logistics processes at container terminals, including the stacking processes. This study is concerned with scheduling storage and retrieval requests for two Automated Stacking Cranes operating in the same block. We show how this problem can be modeled and solved such that the makespan is minimized.</br>
