Title: An Explicit Solution to a Singular Stochastic Optimal Control Problem<br>Author: Mark Squillante, IBM T.J.

A risk-hedging approach is taken to solve the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem for maximizing expected discounted profit over an infinite horizon. We derive a careful analysis of the behavior of the HJB equation that yields the optimal solution and establishes its core properties.
