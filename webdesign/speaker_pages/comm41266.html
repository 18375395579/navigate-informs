<br>Title: An Explicit Solution to a Singular Stochastic Optimal Control Problem</br><br>Author: Mark Squillante, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, mss@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mayank Sharma, Yingdong Lu, Xuefeng Gao</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a control problem that determines a portfolio of positions in internal and external supply sources employed by an organization to best fulfill uncertain demand and address associated risks. A risk-hedging approach is taken to solve the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem for maximizing expected discounted profit over an infinite horizon. We derive a careful analysis of the behavior of the HJB equation that yields the optimal solution and establishes its core properties.</br>
