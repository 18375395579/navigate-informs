Title: Core Deviation Minimizing Auctions<br>Author: Isa Hafalir, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15217, United States of America, isaemin@cmu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study dominant strategy implementable direct mechanisms that minimize the expected surplus from core deviations. Using incentive compatibility conditions, we formulate the core deviation miminimization problem as a calculus of variations problem and then numerically solve it for some particular cases.
