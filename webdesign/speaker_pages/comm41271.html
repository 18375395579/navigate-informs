Natarajan, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, karthik_natarajan@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jayashankar M. Swaminathan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by the ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) supply chain in Africa, we study the problem of managing inventory of a nutritional product in the presence of variable funding constraints. We derive the structure of the optimal inventory and allocation policy and computationally analyze the impact of different funding schedules on the operating costs and waiting times in the system.
