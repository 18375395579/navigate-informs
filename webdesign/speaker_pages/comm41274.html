<br>Title: Deterministic Bounds for Probabilistic Set Multi-Cover Problems</br><br>Author: Feng Qiu, Georgia Tech, 350516 Georgia Tech Station, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, fqiu@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Ahmed, Santanu Dey</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a type of probabilistic set multi-cover problems where each element is to be covered by at least k sets with a certain prescribed probability. We use the LP-based probability bounds to derive inner and outer deterministic approximations. Preliminary computational results are presented.</br>
