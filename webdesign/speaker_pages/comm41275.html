<br>Title: An Equilibrium Model for Distributed Energy Consumption Scheduling in Smart Grid</br><br>Author: Lihui Bai, Assistant Professor, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, United States of America, lihui.bai@louisville.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guangyang Xu, Qipeng Zheng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose an equilibrium model to describe residential users' energy consumption behavior that explicitly considers users' possible preference on convenience over cost-saving. In the proposed user equilibrium model, each user maximizes his/her payoff consisting of convenience and cost, under the real-time pricing in a smart grid. Numerical results for the resulting mixed complementarity problem will be reported.</br>
