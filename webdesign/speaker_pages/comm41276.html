<br>Title: Queuing Approximations for the Inter-terminal Container Transportation (ITT) Problem</br><br>Author: Nishant Mishra, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands, nmishra@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Debjit Roy, Jan-Kees van Ommeren</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose novel queuing approximations for the ITT problem where multiple container terminals use a common fleet of vehicles (ALV, AGV, multi-trailers and barges) to transport containers between terminals. Our approach is decomposition-based where we model the overall queuing network as a closed and an open queuing network, with bulk service capacities. When validating numerically using real-world and simulated data, we find that our approximations result in errors of less than 5%.</br>
