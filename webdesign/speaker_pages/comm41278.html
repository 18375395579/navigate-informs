<br>Title: The Value of Risk Pooling: Impacts of Order Quantity and Economic Parameters</br><br>Author: Jun Zhang, Assistant Professor, Tulane University, A. B. Freeman School of Business, New Orleans, LA, 70123, United States, jzhang4@tulane.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the effects of the inventory level and economic parameters on the value of risk pooling. Our analysis demonstrates that for a given inventory level risk pooling achieves the maximum value when the inventory level is the demand mean. When the inventory level is set to maximize the expected profit, the value of risk pooling increases with both the underage cost and the overage cost; consequently, the value of the critical ratio is NOT an effective indicator for the value of risk pooling.</br>
