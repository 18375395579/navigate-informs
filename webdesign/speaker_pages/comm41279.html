The underlying critically loaded fluid model may or may not be `throughput optimal' in a sense that can be made precise. We discover a new type of `heavy traffic behavior' where it is possible to maintain empty queues with probability approaching one. We show that this can be achieved if and only if throughput optimality does not hold.</br>
