Title: Critically Loaded Queueing Systems that Behave as Underloaded<br>Author: Rami Atar, Associate Professor, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering, Haifa, 32000, Israel, atar@ee.technion.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Avi Mandelbaum, Gennady Shaikhet<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a multiclass queueing system with a fixed number of classes and a fixed number of service stations, in the Halfin-Whitt diffusion asymptotic regime. The underlying critically loaded fluid model may or may not be `throughput optimal' in a sense that can be made precise. We discover a new type of `heavy traffic behavior' where it is possible to maintain empty queues with probability approaching one. We show that this can be achieved if and only if throughput optimality does not hold.
