Title: Scheduling Robotic Cells with a Stochastic Processing Time<br>Author: Neil Geismar, Texas A&M University, Mays Business School, College Station, TX, United States, ngeismar@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Pinedo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the operations of a robotic cell in which one process has a stochastic processing time.   We first demonstrate how proximity of the stochastic process to the bottleneck process effects throughput, which leads to formulas for the cell’s expected throughput.   We also find the distribution function of the robot’s cycle time and verify it with simulation results.   On-line scheduling schemes to improve throughput are also presented.
