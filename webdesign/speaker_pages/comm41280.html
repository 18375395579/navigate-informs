Further, their skills evolve as they gain experience in each task.  We analyze resource allocation in this environment, where immediate delay and buffer penalties are traded off against long term service capacity.  We find that queued jobs should sometimes be served by slower workers when this leads to service rate progress along a typical learning curve.</br>
