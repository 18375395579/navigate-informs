<br>Title: Ranking and Selection Techniques with Overlapping Variance Estimators</br><br>Author: Christopher Healey, Doctoral Student, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Tech, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, chealey@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Goldsman, Seong-Hee Kim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Some ranking and selection (R&S) procedures for steady-state  simulation require an estimate of the asymptotic variance parameter  of each system. We show that the performance of such procedures  depends highly on the quality of the variance estimates that are  used. We study the performance of R&S procedures  with two new variance estimators - overlapping area and  overlapping Cramér-von Mises - which show better  long-run performance than other estimators previously studied in  R&S problems.</br>
