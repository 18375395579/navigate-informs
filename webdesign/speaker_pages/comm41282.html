Title: Accounting for Parameter Uncertainty in Subset Selection for Simulation<br>Author: Canan Gunes Corlu, Assistant Professor, Boston University, 808 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, United States of America, canan@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bahar Biller<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the subset selection procedure for simulation when the parameters of the input distributions are unknown. Redesigning the subset-selection procedure to account for parameter uncertainty, we provide insights into the effect of parameter uncertainty on the performance of subset-selection procedure. We conclude with an illustration of our approach in multi-item inventory control.
