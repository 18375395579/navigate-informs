Title: Optimal Government Debt Control: Explicit Formula for the Optimal Debt Ceiling<br>Author: Abel Cadenillas, Professor, University of Alberta, Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Al, T6G2G1, Canada, abel@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Ricardo Huaman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Motivated by the current debt crisis in the world, we consider a government that wants to   control optimally its debt ratio.  The debt generates a cost for the country.  The government can reduce the debt ratio, but there is a cost associated with this reduction.  We obtain a solution for the  government  debt problem.  In particular, we obtain an explicit formula for the  optimal debt ceiling.
