Customer types are initially unknown but the server has the option of triaging the customers to obtain imperfect information on their types before serving them.  With the objective of minimizing the total holding costs, we obtain analytical characterizations of optimal dynamic and static policies. For example, we prove that the optimal dynamic policy is of threshold type.</br>
