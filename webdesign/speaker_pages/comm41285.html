<br>Title: Flexible Servers in Tandem Lines with Fewer Servers Than Stations</br><br>Author: H. Eser Kirkizlar, Georgia Tech, H. Milton Stewart School of ISyE, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, ekirkizl@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir, Hayriye Ayhan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consider a tandem line with infinite or finite buffers between stations, infinite supply of jobs in front of the first station, and infinite room for storage after the last station.  We study optimal and heuristic server assignment policies when the number of servers is smaller than the number of stations, and also compare the performance of such systems as a function of how flexible the servers are.</br>
