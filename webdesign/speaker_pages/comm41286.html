We also propose a strategy for transferring data between the systems and command centers and develop a process for assigning Controlled Times of Arrivals to flights en route. Analysis suggests that RBS-based algorithms provide strong throughput performance. This improvement is likely achieved, however, at the expense of fuel usage.</br>
