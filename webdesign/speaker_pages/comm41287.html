<br>Title: Tradable Credit Schemes on Networks with Mixed Equilibrium Behaviors</br><br>Author: Fang He, University of Florida, 511 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, jayhe@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin, Nima Shirmohammadi, Yu Nie</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research analyzes and designs tradable credit schemes on networks with two types of players, namely, Cournot-Nash (CN) players and Wardrop-equilibrium (WE) players. We first show that there are nonnegative anonymous credit schemes that yield system optimum, when transaction costs are not considered. We then analyze how transaction costs would affect the trading and route-choice behaviors of both CN and WE players, and formulated the equilibrium conditions into a variational inequality.</br>
