<br>Title: Using CBM data for Army Aviation Fleet Sparing Optimization</br><br>Author: Marshall Smith, Technical Director of Energy Systems, Clockwork Solutions, 115 Wild Basin Rd S, Suite 301, Austin, TX, 78746, United States of America, marshall.smith@clockwork-solutions.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Maximum value of a CBM program in Army Aviation is realized when that program is tied to the Supply Chain supporting the fleet.  We utilize the results of prognostic analytics at the component and tail number level to initialize all tail numbers within a fleet so that supply chain managers can optimize sparing strategies that best address the expected demands throughout the fleet, from the wholesale level down to the unit level.</br>
