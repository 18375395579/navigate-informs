Title: A Primal-dual 2-Approximation Algorithm for the Joint Replenishment Problem<br>Author: David Shmoys, Professor, Cornell University, 232 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, shmoys@cs.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi, Robin Roundy<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We give a primal-dual 2-approximation algorithm (finding a solution of cost twice optimal) for the classical NP-hard joint replenishment problem over a discrete time-horizon with deterministic time-dependent demand. In each time period we are given demand for each item and can order any subset of items paying a joint fixed cost and a fixed cost for each item ordered. On-hand inventory incurs item-dependent holding costs. We must satisfy all demand on time to minimize the fixed and holding costs.
