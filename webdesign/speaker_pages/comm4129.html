Title: On Serving Multiple Unicast Sessions with Inter-Session Network Coding<br>Author: Atilla Eryilmaz, Post-Doctoral Associate, LIDS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 32-D566, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, eryilmaz@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Desmond Lun<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a dynamic Routing-Scheduling-Coding Strategy for serving multiple unicast sessions in networks when linear network coding is allowed across sessions. Noting that the set of stabilizable throughput levels in this context is an open problem, we prove that our strategy supports any point in a recently characterized achievable rate region. This work also provides a theoretical framework in which performance of intersession network coding and pure routing can be compared.
