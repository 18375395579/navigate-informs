<br>Title: Workforce Planning and Scheduling in Large Call Centers: Towards a Unified Approach</br><br>Author: Itai Gurvich, Doctoral Student, Columbia Business School, Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, ig2126@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tolga Tezcan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of workforce planning in a large-scale call center with multiple customer classes and multiple agent types. We propose a comprehensive yet simple solution to the short-term staffing and routing problems as well as to the long-term hiring and training problems. Our analysis highlights key tradeoffs between the short-term and long-term decisions and suggests a new perspective on operational flexibility in call centers.</br>
