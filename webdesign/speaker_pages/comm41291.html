We present a new algorithm, the Influence Limiter, to make existing recommender systems robust. This algorithm can be viewed as learning a robust reputation from ratings on items. We prove limits on the damage that an attacker with a bounded number of shills can cause, and the information loss incurred. We also present nearly matching lower bounds on information loss in any robust recommender.</br>
