Title: Manipulation-Resistant Recommender Systems<br>Author: Rahul Sami, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, School of Information, 1075 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, rsami@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Resnick<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: An attacker can draw attention to undeserving items by manipulating recommender systems. We present a new algorithm, the Influence Limiter, to make existing recommender systems robust. This algorithm can be viewed as learning a robust reputation from ratings on items. We prove limits on the damage that an attacker with a bounded number of shills can cause, and the information loss incurred. We also present nearly matching lower bounds on information loss in any robust recommender.
