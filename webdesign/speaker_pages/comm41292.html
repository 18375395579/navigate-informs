Title: Multi-criterion Dynamic User Equilibrium for Road Pricing Applications with Heterogeneous Users<br>Author: Hani Mahmassani, Professor, The University of Maryland at College Park, Department of Civil & Environmental Engi, College Park, MD, 20742-3021, United States, masmah@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chung-Cheng Lu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop an efficient parametric approach for the assignment of heterogeneous users with continuously distributed value of time, value of schedule delay and value of reliability, in a network with dynamic prices and managed lanes on certain roadway facilities.  The algorithm determines equilibrium user responses in terms of path and departure time choices, and the associated network flow patterns.
