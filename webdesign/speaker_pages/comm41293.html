<br>Title: Dominance Rules for Parallel Machines Scheduling Problems</br><br>Author: David Savourey, University of Technology of Compiegne, Centre de Recherches de Royallieu, Compiègne, FR, 60200, France, david.savourey@hds.utc.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antoine Jouglet</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present some new dominance rules for parallel machines scheduling problems to minimize total cost, such that (weighted) sum of completion times or total (weighted) tardiness. Let P be a set of sheduled jobs. The idea is to examine under which it will always be more interesting to schedule a job i after P rather than another unscheduled job j. Numerical results comparing two tree-based searches, with or without these dominance rules, will be presented.</br>
