Title: Solving large-scale DEA problems by using small samples<br>Author: Wen-Chih Chen, Associate Professor, National Chiao Tung University, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd., Hsinchu, Taiwan - ROC, wenchih@faculty.nctu.edu.tw<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving larger-scale DEA problems by using small size samples. We are able to control the size of individual LP problems under a prespecified limit while maintaining the solution quality.
