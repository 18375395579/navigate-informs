<br>Title: The Allocation of Indivisible Objects via Rounding</br><br>Author: Rakesh Vohra, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60201, United States of America, r-vohra@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thanh Nguyen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Allocating indivisible objects arises in spectrum licenses, landing slots at airports and assigning students to schools. This paper proposes a technique for making allocations based on rounding a fractional allocation. Under the assumption that no agent wants to consume more than k items, the technique can be interpreted as giving agents lotteries over approximately feasible integral allocations that preserve the ex-ante efficiency and fairness properties of the initial fractional allocation.</br>
