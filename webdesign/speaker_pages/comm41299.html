Title: Distributed Storage for Intermittent Energy Sources: Control Design and Performance Limits<br>Author: Yashodhan Kanoria, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, 350 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, ykanoria@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Tse, Baosen Zhang, Andrea Montanari<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The power output of renewable energy sources like wind and solar varies with time and location. Two strategies have been proposed to manage this variability: 1) energy storage systems to average over time; 2) distributed generation to average over location. We introduce a network model to study the optimal use of storage and transmission resources, and propose a control design methodology. For specific network topologies we show asymptotic optimality and analytically quantify performance.
