Title: Revisiting the Estimation of Marginal Cost of Highway Pavement Maintenance<br>Author: Shadi B. Anani, Ph.D. Candidate, University of California, Berkeley, anani@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samer Madanat<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In order for highway pavement marginal cost pricing to achieve its objectives, accurate estimates of pavement deterioration marginal costs are needed. This paper reviews an approach used for estimating these costs, questions three common assumptions and relaxes one of them, namely the assumption that pavement deterioration is deterministic.
