Title: Making Clean Water, Power, and Green Materials from Wastewater<br>Author: Jing Ma, PH.D Candidate, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering Dep, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, jingma@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Craig Criddle, Erica Plambeck, Sebastien Tilmans<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: U.S. wastewater treatment infrastructure is past its design life, wastes energy.  Working with two bay-area municipal utilities, we characterize optimal capacity investments and OM to profitably convert wastewater and trucked organic waste to multiple valuable products. GHG policy and water policy must be optimized jointly to incentivize socially optimal investments and operations.
