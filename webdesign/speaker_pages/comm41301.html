Title: Localized Charging Policies for Greener Transportation Electrification<br>Author: Mahdi Kefayati, Research Assistant, The University of Texas at Austin, 2501 Speedway Stop C0803 ENS 541, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, kefayati@utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ross Baldick<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: By analyzing PEV charging demand based on empirical traffic data, we first show that there is substantial flexibility in controlling charging rate, without sacrificing users?comfort. Then, we show that the aggregate load of PEVs, if charged like conventional loads, exacerbates the diurnal variability of electricity demand. Finally, we propose a localized charge rate control policy that reduces PEV load coincidence with conventional demand and increases its correlation with wind energy.
