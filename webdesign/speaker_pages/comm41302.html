<br>Title: Analyzing Scrip Systems: Selection Rules and Optimality</br><br>Author: Kris Johnson, PhD Candidate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Operations Research Center, 154 Cedar Street, #4-3, Somerville, MA, 02144, United States of America, krisdj@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peng Sun, David Simchi-Levi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Scrip systems provide a non-monetary trade economy for exchange of resources. We model a scrip system as a stochastic game and study system design issues on selection rules to match trade partners over time. We show the optimality of one rule in terms of maximizing social welfare, while satisfying individual rationality constraints. We also investigate the optimal number of scrips to issue and find that there is an upper bound (possibly infinity) on the number of scrips allowed in the system.</br>
