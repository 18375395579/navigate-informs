Programs use decentralized markets making it difficult to achieve balance. We show that stable equilibria discourage net-exporting colleges from exchange. We introduce two-sided top-trading-cycles as the unique mechanism that is balanced-efficient, student-strategy-proof, and respecting priority bylaws regarding dependent eligibility.</br>
