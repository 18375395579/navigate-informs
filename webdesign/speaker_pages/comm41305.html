Title: An Integrated Outbound Logistics Model for Frito-Lay: Coordinating Aggregate Level Production and Distribution Decisions<br>Author: Sila Cetinkaya, Associate Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial & Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, 77840-3131, United States of America, sila@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Halit Uster, Gopalakrishnan Easwaran, Burcu Keskin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe research results that are aimed at improving Frito-Lay's outbound logistics activities via simultaneous optimization of inventory and transportation decisions. We develop an integrated lot-sizing and vehicle routing model with explicit plant-to-store delivery considerations. We present an iterative solution approach that builds on decomposing the model into lot-sizing and routing components. We demonstrate that plant-to-store deliveries, along with efficient inventory and transportation decisions, present a significant opportunity for cost savings.
