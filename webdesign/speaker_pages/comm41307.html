Title: Objective Operational Learning in Inventory Control<br>Author: Lian Yu, University of California, Berkeley, Department of Industrial Engineering, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, liany@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Lim, J. George Shanthikumar<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Suppose the demand depends on the inventory level. Any learning approach that ignores this dependency may be subject to spiral down effects. We present an objective operational learning approach where the operational order quantity determined by this approach will converge to the optimal order quantity.
