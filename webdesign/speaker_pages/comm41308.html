Title: Integrated Production and Delivery Scheduling with Disjoint Windows<br>Author: Yumei Huo, Assistant Professor, CUNY at Staten Island, Department of Computer Science, Staten Island, NY, 10314, United States of America, huo@mail.csi.cuny.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Y-T. Leung, Xin Wang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Consider a company that manufactures perishable goods. There is a small time window that the product can be produced before its delivery. Given a set of jobs with each job specifying its delivery time, processing time and profit, we want to schedule a subset of jobs so as to maximize the total profit. We consider both the single machine case and the parallel machines case. Polynomial-time algorithms, pseudo-polynomial algorithms, and fully polynomial time approximation schemes are given.
