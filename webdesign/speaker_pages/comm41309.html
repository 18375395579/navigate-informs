Distributing relief supplies efficiently in the immediate hours is critical. This paper investigates the effects of relief center design, routing strategies and staffing policies on the efficiency of aid delivery. Relief centers are modeled as a network of multi-class finite capacity queues with state dependent routing. Numerical investigations identify the combinations that result in fastest aid delivery to victims.
