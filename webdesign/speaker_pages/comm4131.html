Title: Network Design with Service Guarantees<br>Author: Prakash Mirchandani, Professor, University of Pittsburgh, 358 Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States of America, PMIRCHAN@katz.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anant Balakrishnan, Bo Zhang, Gang Li<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Traditional cost minimization network design models emphasize scale economies and often exhibit solutions that provide poor customer service along dimensions such as delay and reliability.   We study the network design problem with end-to-end service guarantees, identify several classes of underlying valid inequalities, and develop a successful cutting-plane approach for the problem.
