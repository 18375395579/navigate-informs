Title: Delay Propagation<br>Author: Akira Kondo, Senior OR Analyst, FAA, 800 Independence Agenue, Washington, DC, 20591, United States of America, akira.kondo@faa.gov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A process of delay propagation is tracked by sequencing airlines city pair flights time-wise, using tail numbers.  A definition is established when a propagated delay materializes.  Measures and statistics are computed such as leap counts and multipliers for the propagated delays.  Further, shapes of the distributions of the propagated delays are examined to group them into three types and to describe changing development of the types during the course of the day.
