Title: Fair Allocation on Economic Networks<br>Author: Shyam Sundar Chandramouli, Phd Student, Columbia University, 547 riverside Dr, Apt 2E, NYC, NY, 10027, United States of America, sc3102@columbia.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This talk is related to a unified approach to fair allocation on bipartite economic networks. We study the group strategyproof  and strong invariance property of Egalitarian and Edge Fair mechanisms. We also analyze the price of consistency i.e. how consistent mechanisms fail to be incompatible with certain notions of fairness. We conclude with mechanisms of fair allocation to more general non-bipartite networks.
