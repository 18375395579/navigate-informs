(1) A “defender?chooses a budget-limited set of infrastructure components to harden. (2) An “attacker?sees the hardened system and attacks it using limited resources. (3) The defender operates the damaged system as best possible. The defender, at level 1, seeks to maximize system functionality after a worst-case attack.  We illustrate with a realistic electric power-transmission problem.</br>
