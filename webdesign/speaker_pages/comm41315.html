At the tactical level, the airports in which new facilities will be opened are determined together with fleet allocations while the daily flight schedules are constructed at the operational level. We use an integrated model that determines the flight scheduling as well as the facility locations, and use this model in an incremental fashion to open the facilities gradually in time.</br>
