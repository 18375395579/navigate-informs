Title: An Analytic Class of Distributions<br>Author: Liming Feng, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, fenglm@illinois.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: It has been established that a probability distribution with a characteristic function in a certain analytic class can be recovered very efficiently. We present conditions under which a characteristic function falls into this analytic class. As a financial example, the distribution of the log return process in the Duffie-Pan-Singleton derivatives pricing model is analyzed.
