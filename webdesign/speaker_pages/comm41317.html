<br>Title: Cross Training in Call Centers with Uncertain Arrivals and Global Service Level Agreements</br><br>Author: Tom Robbins, Assistant Professor, East Carolina University, trrobbins@mac.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Terry Harrison</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider agent cross-training in call centers where arrival rates are uncertain and the call center is subject to a global service level constraint.  We investigate the option of cross training a subset of agents so that they may serve calls from two separate projects, a process we refer to as partial pooling.  We find that cross training a modest portion of the staff yields significant benefits.</br>
