The model is formulated, analyzed and an algorithm that finds the optimal location of one facility in a bounded area in the plane is constructed. Problems involving continuous demand on a segment, square, disk, are investigated. Randomly generated problems with up to 10,000 demand points are successfully solved in a reasonable computer time.</br>
