Maintenance is not considered. However  machines require maintenance which must be planned on production schedule. The objective of this paper is to minimize jobs completion time and also schedule preventive maintenance by using genetic algorithms. An application is demonstrated for a case study in electro-mechanic industry for press shop weekly scheduling under a strict maintenance plan.
