<br>Title: Genetic Job-shop Scheduling Integrated with Preventive Maintenance Plan</br><br>Author: Baha Guney, Ass. Prof., Sakarya University, Muh. Fak. Esentepe Kampus, Serdivan, Adapazari, SA, 54187, Turkey, bguney@sakarya.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kemal Cakir, Ahmet Erdem, Emin Gundogar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Generally job-shop scheduling problem focuses on minimizing the total completion time of all jobs. Maintenance is not considered. However  machines require maintenance which must be planned on production schedule. The objective of this paper is to minimize jobs completion time and also schedule preventive maintenance by using genetic algorithms. An application is demonstrated for a case study in electro-mechanic industry for press shop weekly scheduling under a strict maintenance plan.</br>
