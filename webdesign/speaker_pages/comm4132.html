Title: Sensor Location for Maximum Network Observability under Dynamic Traffic Conditions<br>Author: Sushant Sharma, Purdue University, NEXTRANS, 3000 Kent Avenue, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sharma57@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study addresses the network sensor location problem under dynamic traffic conditions. A theoretical model is proposed to determine the subset of links to install sensors on for maximum network observability in a given time horizon. The efficacy of the proposed model is demonstrated using a study network.
