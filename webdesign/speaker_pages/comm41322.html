Title: Multi-objective Optimization of a Forest Biomass Supply Chain in Interior British Columbia<br>Author: Claudia Cambero, PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia, 29-432424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6J1C6, Canada, cambero.claudia@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Taraneh Sowlati<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model for the design of a forest biomass supply chain for bioenergy/ bioproducts. Objective functions are to maximize NPV, maximize direct jobs and minimize life cycle global warming potential. The ?-constraint method will be used to obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions deciding on biomass sources; type, size and location of facilities; type and volume of products and; flow of biomass and products within the supply chain.
