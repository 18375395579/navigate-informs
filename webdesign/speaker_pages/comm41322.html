Objective functions are to maximize NPV, maximize direct jobs and minimize life cycle global warming potential. The ?-constraint method will be used to obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions deciding on biomass sources; type, size and location of facilities; type and volume of products and; flow of biomass and products within the supply chain.</br>
