<br>Title: A Probabilistic Framework for Weather-Based Rerouting and Delay Estimations</br><br>Author: Michael McCrea, Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army/Virginia Tech, #5 Staff Village, Radford, VA, 24141, United States, mvmccrea@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hanif D. Sherali, Antonio Trani</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a severe weather-modeling paradigm within the context of a large-scale Airspace Planning and Collaborative Decision-Making Model in order to reroute flights with respect to a specified probability threshold of encountering severe weather, subject to collision safety, airline equity, and sector workload considerations.  Our modeling constructs include the development of discretized representations of weather phenomena along with a probabilistic delay assessment methodology.</br>
