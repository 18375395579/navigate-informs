Title: On-sensor Data Processing for Efficient System Monitoring<br>Author: Yu Ding, Associate Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, yuding@iemail.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chiwoo Park<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Wireless sensor networks become more and more popular in the applications of monitoring, detection, and diagnosis. On-sensor data processing and reduction is critical for a wireless sensor network to fulfill its monitoring mission efficiently because of the network's power and communication limitations. This talk discusses a few on-sensor data processing techniques that can help remove data redundancy in a sensor network and reduce the data transmission rate.
