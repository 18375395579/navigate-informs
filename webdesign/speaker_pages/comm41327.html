Title: Interacting Criteria in Robust Ordinal Regression<br>Author: Salvatore Greco, Professor, University of Catania, Corso Italia 55, Catania, 95129, Italy, salgreco@unict.it<br>Coauthor(s): Vincent Mousseau, Johannes Siebert, Roman Slowinski<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present new ways of handling interactions among criteria, which is a challenging problem in MCDA. They are based on Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) where the classical MAUT additive value function has been  augmented by two components: “bonus?and “penalty?values for (mutually exclusive) positively and negatively interacting pairs of criteria, respectively. Two ROR methods are presented: UTAGMS-INT, able to handle unipolar interactions, and UTA^GSS, able to handle bipolar interactions.
