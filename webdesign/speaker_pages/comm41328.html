We propose and model two systems: Ante-Delivery Ensuring system (ADES) and Post-Delivery Ensuring system (PDES). For each developed model, we characterize theoretically the optimal decisions, and derive sensitivity results on how these decisions are affected by one another and the yield and demand uncertainties.
