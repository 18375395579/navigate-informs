The supplier serves a higher and lower priority class with a short and a flexible lead-time requirement, respectively. Unsatisfied customer orders are fully backlogged. With the backlogged the orders, one has to consider the priority to clear backlogs. We consider FCFS and SCFS rules. We characterize optimal inventory-commitment and inventory-replenishment policies.
