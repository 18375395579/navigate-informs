Title: Operation of Fully Renewable Electric Energy Systems<br>Author: Antonio Conejo, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Department of Electrical Engineering, Campus Universitario, Ciudad Real, 13071, Spain, Antonio.Conejo@uclm.es<br>Coauthor(s): Miguel Carrion, Ruth Dominguez<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Fully renewable electric energy systems are rare but for a number of reasons it is desirable that they become ubiquitous. We consider a fully renewable electric energy system, propose an optimal dispatching model for such system, and describe its associated pricing mechanism. This model relies on a two-stage stochastic programming problem, whose first stage represents the day-ahead dispatching and whose second stage represents actual operation under different renewable production scenarios.
