Title: Dynamic Traffic Assignment and the Route-link Consistency Issue<br>Author: Hillel Bar-Gera, Dr., Ben-Gurion University, 5038 S. Hardy Dr., #2095, Tempe, AZ, 85282, United States of America, bargera@bgu.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Michal Blumberg, Shmuel Rahamim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Most macroscopic dynamic traffic assignment models focus either on traffic flow behavior or on flow propagation along trajectories. Each approach suffers from consistency issues, which will be illustrated by specific examples. As an alternative, we propose to integrate the two approaches using anticipated arrival order combined with LWR flow behavior.
