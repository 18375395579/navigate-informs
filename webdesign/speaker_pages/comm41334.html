<br>Title: Satisficing Measures for Analysis of Risky Positions</br><br>Author: David Brown, Assistant Professor, Duke University: Fuqua School of Business, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, dbbrown@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Melvyn Sim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this work we consider a class of measures for evaluating the quality of risky portfolios based on their performance relative to desired targets. We call these measures satisficing measures and show that they are dual to classes of corresponding risk measures. These dual descriptions have significant practical value in that they involve specifications of target or benchmark performance levels as opposed to risk tolerance parameters.</br>
