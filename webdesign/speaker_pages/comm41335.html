Title: Locating Noisy Counting Sensors to Estimate Network Flows<br>Author: Pitu Mirchandani, Professor, Arizona State University, 699 S Mill Ave., Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, pitu@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ning Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The following problem is addressed.  There are unknown flows on known routes.  There is some probabilistic prior knowledge on the flows. We can locate some sensors that provide flow rates with known reliabilities.  We seek the optimal locations of these sensors using a Bayesian framework for estimating flows.
