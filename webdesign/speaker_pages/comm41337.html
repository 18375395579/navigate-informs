<br>Title: On the Reliable Facility Location Problem</br><br>Author: Tingting Cui, UC Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, tingting@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of locating facilities to minimize the expected facility, transport, and capacity reservation costs when candidate locations are subject to failure with certain probilities. Various modeling and solution techniques are outlined with extensive computational studies.</br>
