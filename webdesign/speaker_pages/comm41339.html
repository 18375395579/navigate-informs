Title: Series Expansions for Random Walks<br>Author: Josh Reed, New York University, 44 West 4th St., New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, jreed@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cliff Hurvich<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a new proof for a series expansions for the expected value of the first ascending ladder height of a Gaussian random walk in terms of mean increment size. Extensions of our result to heavy-tailed increments are also discussed.
