Title: Measuring the Impact of Force Generation Policies on Force Size<br>Author: Steven Stoddard, Operations Research Analyst, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Program Analysis and Evaluation, Land Forces Division, Washington, DC, 20301-1800, United States of America, Steven.Stoddard@osd.mil<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: To analyze force size and rotation/readiness policies, we employ a method that shows contingency and enduring operations along with a service’s force generation policies.  We use a graphical frontier to show feasible combinations of events under various force generation policies.  Each frontier is a graph of supply capacity that is constant for any force size and force generation policy.  This allows assessment of force size, force generation process, and the range of potential demand scenarios.
