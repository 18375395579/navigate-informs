Title: Adaptive Methods for Inventory Control<br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, School of ORIE, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, ht88@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sumit Kunnumkal<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We describe a generic adaptive approach to compute the optimal projection levels in a number of inventory control problems. Our approach requires only samples of the demand random variables and it continues to work when the demand random variables are censored by the inventory availability.
