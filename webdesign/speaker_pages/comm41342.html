Box 751 CEE, OR 97207-075, Portland, OR, United States of America, figliozzi@pdx.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Feng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This research presents a vehicle fleet replacement model that aims at minimizing fleet total net cost in a planning time horizon, including purchase cost, energy cost, operating and maintenance cost, emissions cost and salvage revenue. A set of economic and technological factors, as well as fleet initial configuration are incorporated into the model, and their impacts on the competitiveness between electric trucks and conventional trucks are analyzed.</br>
