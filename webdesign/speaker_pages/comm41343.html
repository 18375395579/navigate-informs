<br>Title: Two Results About the Size of Weighted Matchings, with Applications to Kidney Paired Donation</br><br>Author: Sommer E.

Michael, Dorry L. Segev</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Kidney paired donation matches a patient and incompatible donor with another patient and donor for an organ exchange. The best donations are a weighted graph matching. A preemptive multiobjective matching problem is: first maximize transplants for a favored group, second maximize transplants for all, and lastly maximize geographic proximity of the donations. Two results about the size of weighted matchings allow solution of the multiobjective problem using standard weighted matching techniques.</br>
