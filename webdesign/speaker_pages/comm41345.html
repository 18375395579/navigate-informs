Title: Mean Field Equilibria of Multiarmed Bandit Games<br>Author: Ramki Gummadi, Stanford University, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, gummadi@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jia Yuan Yu, Ramesh Johari<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a multiarmed bandit setting consisting of multiple agents, where the reward distributions depend on choices made by other agents. We consider a solution concept for the resulting bandit game inspired by a large agent population approximation called mean field eqilibrium. We obtain sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness and approximation properties of such equilibria for a broad class of reward functions.
