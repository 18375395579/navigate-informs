<br>Title: Polyhedral Results for 1-restricted Simple 2-matchings</br><br>Author: Yanjun Li, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 403 W. State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, li14@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Hartvigsen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A simple 2-matching in a graph is a subgraph whose connected components are paths and cycles. A 1-restricted simple 2-matching is a simple 2-matching with no isolated edges.  Such matchings are related to the TSP.  We study a family of graphs on which the convex hull of 1-restricted simple 2-matchings has a simple description, introduce a new class of valid blossom-type inequalities, and show that the general polytope could be complex.</br>
