A number of package servers are to be located at nodes of a network. Demand for services of these servers is located at each node, and a subset of nodes are to be chosen to locate one or more package servers in each. Each customer is associated to a package. The objective is to minimize the number of package servers while maximizing quality of services related to the efficiency and the reliability of the broadcast of packages to all customers.</br>
