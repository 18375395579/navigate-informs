<br>Title: A Predictive Maintenance Policy Based on Two Explicative Variables</br><br>Author: Estelle Deloux, Ph.D. student, Ecole des Mines de Nantes/IRCCyN, Rue Alfred Kastler, Nantes, 44307, France, estelle.deloux@emn.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christophe Berenguer, B. Castanier</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We are interested in the modelling and the evaluation of a maintenance policy for a single-unit system with a single failure mode function of several measurable quantities. The failure mode can be partially explained by two variables stochastically increasing with time. The probability of failure is assumed to increase with these variables. Different maintenance policies will be discussed in regard with their performance when the associated decision parameters minimize a given cost criterion.</br>
