<br>Title: Accommodating the Preferences of Nurses via Shift Auctions</br><br>Author: Melanie De Grano, Pennsylvania State University, 310 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, mxd265@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The scheduling system in this research allows nurses to express their preferences for shifts via auction.  Nurses bid for their preferred working shifts and rest shifts using points; an optimization model then seeks to award the highest bidders while maintaining hospital requirements. After the auction, vacant shifts are allocated to nurses who have not yet completed their schedules.  Test problems indicate that this auction system awards a high percentage of requests.</br>
