Title: Automatic Target Adjustment for Goal Programming Problems<br>Author: Glenn Kuriger, University of Oklahoma, 100 East Boyd, SEC, Suite R-208, Norman, OK, 73019, United States, kuriger@ou.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hank Grant<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: An Automatic Target Adjustment (ATA) technique was developed that uses simulation optimization to automatically adjust the target levels of goal programming simulation optimization problems. The target levels were adjusted to ensure that the top two goals were satisfied and that all the goals were satisfied. The best target levels for each case were then selected and the goal programming simulation optimization problems were re-solved at these new target levels.
