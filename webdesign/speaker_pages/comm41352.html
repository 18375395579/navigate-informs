Title: Approximations to the Length of VRP Problems<br>Author: Miguel Figliozzi, Assistant Professor, Portland State University, 1930 SW 4th Avenue, Suite 200, Portland, OR, United States, figliozzi@pdx.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This presentation discusses approximations to the length of Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP). Formulas to approximate the length of vehicle routes are proposed. Instances with different patterns of customer spatial distribution, time windows, customer demands, and depot locations are used to test the proposed approximations. Expressions for the incremental cost of serving an additional customer or increasing the number of routes are derived and estimated.
