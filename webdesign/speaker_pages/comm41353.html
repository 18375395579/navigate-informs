Title: Robust Inventory Management Problems<br>Author: Nuri Ozbay, nso2001@columbia.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider setting inventory control policies when the demand is uncertain, in a robust framework. Unlike traditional inventory models which assume that the demand is random with a known distribution, there exists an adversary who picks the demand from a deterministic uncertainty set. We consider the problem for several different types of inventory control policies such as basestock policies and safety stock policies. We present algorithms that scale well to large scale problems.
