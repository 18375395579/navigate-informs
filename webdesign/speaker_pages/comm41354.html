Title: A Push-and-pull Based Distributed Control of Stream Processing Networks<br>Author: Cathy H. Xia, Research Scientist, IBM Research, TJ Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, cathyx@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Li Zhang, Hanhua Feng, Zhen Liu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A fundamental problem in stream processing systems is how to meet various quality of service (QoS) requirements using effective admission control and resource allocation mechanisms. We consider a stream processing system with a network of cooperating servers, collectively providing processing services for multiple data streams. We present a pull-and-pull based distributed control algorithm that guarantees the network stability and achieves the maximum system utility in the long run.
