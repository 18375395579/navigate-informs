<br>Title: Stochastic Sequential Scheduling without Fixed Appointment Slot for Outpatient Clinics</br><br>Author: Santanu Chakraborty, Purdue University, 203 Martin Jischke Drive, Mann Hall, Suite 225, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, santanu@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Lawley, Kumar Muthuraman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we develop a sequential scheduling algorithm for the case where the service period is not divided into slots. We assume that the service time distribution is exponential and each patient is characterized by a certain no-show probability.</br>
