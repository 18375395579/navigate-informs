Title: A Robust Re-optimization Scheme for Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)<br>Author: Fei Peng, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, IOE Department, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States of America, feipeng@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marina Epelman, Edwin Romeijn<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Errors in patient setup position can bring uncertainty into radiation therapy treatments. While robust planning before the treatment in some way accounts for this uncertainty, it is unable to foresee variations in the actual delivered dose. We propose a robust re-optimization scheme that adjusts the model according to the delivered dose and the number of fractions remaining, and periodically re-optimizes the plan. Comparison with the one-shot optimization is presented with real-patient cases.
