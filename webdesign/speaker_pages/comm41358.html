Title: Fair Cost Sharing Mechanisms for Last Mile Ridesharing<br>Author: Shih-Fen Cheng, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 80 Stamford Road, Singapore, 178902, Singapore, sfcheng@smu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Duc Thien Nguyen, Hoong Chuin Lau<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a dynamic mechanism for last-mile ride-sharing on a non-dedicated commercial fleet. This problem is addressed as two sub-problems: vehicle routing and cost sharing. We propose auction mechanisms to elicit willing payments from passengers. We show that our mechanisms are budget balanced, fair, and incentive compatible. We also show how the winner determination problem can be solved efficiently. A real-world case study is presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.
