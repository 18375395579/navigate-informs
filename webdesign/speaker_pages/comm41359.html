Title: Equilibrium Queue Joining and Service Rate Policies for Services with a Credence Good Character<br>Author: Laurens Debo, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, laurdebo@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Services with a credence character are services for which the customers cannot verify how much time is required to address their needs. The equilibrium joining strategy for such services may exhibit a `Follow-The-Crowd' characteristic. The joining probability at the empty queue may be higher than the joining probability at the idling service provider and also higher than the joining probability at the non-empty queue. The service provider strategically slows down when the queue depletes.
