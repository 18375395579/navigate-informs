Title: Pricing of Path Dependent Claims in Regime Switching Markets<br>Author: Agostino Capponi, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 315 North Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, capponi@purdue.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We obtain a novel Poisson series representation for the arbitrage-free price of vulnerable contingent claims in a regime-switching market. This representation, along with a short-time asymptotic expansion of the claim's price process, yields an efficient method for pricing path dependent claims. The proposed method is demonstrated on a class of path-dependent claims that we term self-decomposable, as well as on the class of vulnerable stock options.
