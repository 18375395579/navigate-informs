<br>Title: Modeling Time-dependent Overflows in Call Centers</br><br>Author: Raik Stolletz, Dr., Leibniz University Hannover, Department of Production Management, Koenigsworther Plat 1, Hannover, 30167, Germany, raik.stolletz@prod.uni-hannover.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Manitz</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The considered call center consists of a front and a back office. A fraction b of customers receiving service in the front office will be routed to the back office. An overflow of waiting calls from the front-office queue to the back office happens, if the waiting time exceeds t time units and a back-office agent is available. The analysis is reduced to a CTMC with state-dependent overflows. Numerical experiments demonstrate the reliability of this Markovian performance approximation.</br>
