<br>Title: Spatial Refueling Patterns of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Drivers in Southern California</br><br>Author: Scott Kelley, PhD Student, Arizona State University, Sch of Geog Sciences & Urban Planning, 975 S. Myrtle Ave., Coor Hall, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, sbkelley55@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Kuby</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This study surveyed 259 drivers of compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles at five stations in greater Los Angeles, and 261 respondents refueling at five nearby gasoline stations.  Using GIS, we calculate deviations from shortest paths necessitated by refueling, station service areas, and proximity to home.  When faced with a choice, CNG drivers select stations on their way rather than closest to home by a 10:1 margin, an important implication for developing early alt-fuel station networks.</br>
