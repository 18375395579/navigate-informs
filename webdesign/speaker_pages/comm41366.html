Title: Simple Markovian Model of a Limit Order Book<br>Author: Elena Yudovina, University of Michigan Department of Statistics, West Hall, 1085 South University Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, e.yudovina@statslab.cam.ac.uk<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a simple Markovian model of a limit order book, in which the arriving limit orders have identical price distributions independent of the state of the limit order book. We examine the surprising dynamics of the resulting process, and characterise the three different regions with different steady-state behaviours.
