<br>Title: Unbalanced Random Matching Markets</br><br>Author: Jacob Leshno, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, yarboz@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Itai Ashlagi, Yashodhan Kanoria</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We analyze random matching markets with unequal numbers of men and women. Being on the short side of the market confers a large advantage. If there are n men and n+1 women then whp in any stable matching, the men's average rank of their wives is no more than 3\log n, whereas the women's average rank of their husbands is at least n/(3\log n). If there are n men and (1+a)n women for a>0 then whp in any stable matching the men's average rank is O(1), and women's average rank is \Omega(n).</br>
