Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming for the Stochastic Control of a Wind Energy Storage System<br>Author: Daniel Salas, Princeton University, 228 Sherrerd Hall, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, dsalas@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: One of the main challenges in developing wind energy storage strategies is to maximize the allocation efficiency of the storage devices, which may be charged or discharged at each point in time. These devices are generally treated as simple black-box models which do not explicitly reflect the underlying physicochemical principles. ADP is proposed as a way to obtain a practical control policy for a more realistic battery system, by taking into account the uncertainty in supply and demand.
