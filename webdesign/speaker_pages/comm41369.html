Title: Improved Required Time of Arrival Functionality in the Presence of Uncertainty<br>Author: John-Paul Clarke, Associate Professor, Georgia Tech, 270 Ferst Drive N.W., Atlanta, GA, 30332-0150, United States of America, johnpaul@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Clayton Tino<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Required Time of Arrival (RTA) functionality must be improved to enable Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO) as proposed for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). We address this need by developing a heuristic algorithm that computes the best cruise speed given modeled uncertainties in the en route winds and the potential actions that could be taken further along the trajectory to ensure to a given probability that the RTA is met while minimizing the fuel that is expended.
