Title: Staffing a Helpdesk with Two Queues Connected by Abandonment<br>Author: Yusik Kim, PhD Student, University of California at Berkeley IEOR, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1777, United States, ykim@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ronald Wolff, Rhonda Righter, Vijay Mehrota<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consider a helpdesk that has two methods of providing customer service: replying to email and answering phone calls. Each service has its own queue and arrival process, but customers may abandon the email queue to enter the phone queue. We analyze the system under the assumption of exponential service, inter-arrival and abandonment times, develop a cost model as a function of the number of servers and discuss its convexity structure.  We also study properties of the optimal staffing levels.
