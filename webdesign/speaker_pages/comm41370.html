The sequence of arrival and service rates are linear in n, whereas the abandonment distribution is constant. All r.v.’s have general distributions. In the limit, the diffusion-scaled, abandonment-filtered virtual waiting time process is an OU process whose drift is proportional to the traffic intensity-weighted sum of the abandonment densities, each evaluated at the limiting deterministic waiting time value.</br>
