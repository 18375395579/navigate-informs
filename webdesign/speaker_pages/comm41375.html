Title: Time-dependent Bid-prices in Network Revenue Management<br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Cornell University, Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States, ht88@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sumit Kunnumkal<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Linear programming (LP) approaches for the network revenue management problem implicitly assume that the bid-prices remain constant throughout the planning horizon. The dynamic nature of the bid-prices is mimicked by periodically resolving the LPs. In this talk, we present a new class of LPs that naturally yield time-dependent bid-prices. Like the earlier ones, these LPs provide upper bounds on the optimal objective revenue and the bid-prices computed by them are asymptotically optimal.
