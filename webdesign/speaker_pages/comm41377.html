From the moment a container is dropped off from the vessels at the sea terminals, several options for the final transportation to the hinterland can be considered: trucks, barges and trains. The logistic planner decides the best allocation for the containers to the available means of transport. The objective is to minimize the costs for the transportation while guaranteeing a high service level and low congestion at the sea terminal.</br>
