<br>Title: Data Broadcast in Heterogenous Networks</br><br>Author: Yoo-Ah Kim, Assistant Professor, University of Connecticut, Computer Science & Engineering Departmen, 371 Fairfield Way, U-2155, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, ykim@engr.uconn.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the data broadcast problem in a heterogeneous cluster where each node has different speed. Two models are considered: (i) the transfer time from X to Y is set by the speed of sender X, and (ii) the time is the maximum of the speeds of X and Y. We show that simple greedy algorithms give approximation ratios of 1.5 and 2 respectively. We also present instances in which the algorithms give solutions 8/7 and 7/6 times the optimal, respectively.</br>
