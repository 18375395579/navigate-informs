Leveraging on the moving boundary approach to American option pricing, we characterize upper bounds on this cost in terms of only the option’s intrinsic value and the value function associated with delayed exercise for a variety of market models from the simple Black-Scholes model to complex Stochastic Volatility Jump-diffusion models. We present illustrations of these bounds for both put and call options.</br>
