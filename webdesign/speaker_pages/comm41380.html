Title: An Integrated Module for Aircraft Maintenance Routing and Work Packaging<br>Author: Nima Safaei, PhD, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, safaei@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew K.S. Jardine<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The purpose of this study is to present an integrated decision module which covers the disadvantages of cyclic rotation, a dominant policy in the literature on aircraft maintenance routing. This module is to determine the week-length route per aircraft, consolidate the maintenance tasks into the work packages, and assign them to the maintenance opportunities existing in the route. Real datasets of different airlines are used to validate the applicability and performance of the proposed module.
