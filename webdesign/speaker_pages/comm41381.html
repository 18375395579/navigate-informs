<br>Title: Stochastic Programming Based Priority Allocation Rules for the M System</br><br>Author: Marty Reiman, Bell Labs, 600 Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ, United States of America, marty@research.bell-labs.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Dogru, Qiong Wang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The M system is an assemble-to-order inventory system with two components and three products. Applying a stochastic programming (SP) based approach that we previously developed, we identify four cost parameter regions for the M system, each of which has a distinct priority allocation rule. We consider allocation policies with and without component reservation. Our allocation rule, coupled with base-stock levels obtained from the SP, performs well in numerical experiments.</br>
