<br>Title: Specifying Team Sizes with Interdependent Tasks and Nonlinear Sharing Functions</br><br>Author: Ronald Askin, Professor and Chair, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States of America, Ron.Askin@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Liangjie Xue</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the optimal sizes of task teams for projects with multiple, interdependent tasks.  Based on task requirements, nonlinear worksharing functions are used to define cumulative team efficiency as a function of team size.  Computational results demonstrate the performance of several strategies and allocation methods for various project configurations and task characteristics.</br>
