<br>Title: Pricing Scheduling Flexibility of Electricity Generation Facilities</br><br>Author: Valeriy Ryabchenko, valeriy@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stanislav Uryasev</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The paper presents a heuristic for valuation of tolling agreement contracts on power generation assets. We build a LP model to find approximations of optimal operating boundaries. We consider different operational constraints, such as start-up and shut-down costs, ramp-up period etc. We consider general markovian martingale processes for electricity and fuel price dynamics. In order to make the model robust we incorporate a set of  optimal boundary shape constraints.</br>
