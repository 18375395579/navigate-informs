Title: Giant Component in Random Multipartite Graphs with Given Degree Sequences<br>Author: Sidhant Misra, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 32D-572, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, sidhant@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): David Gamarnik<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a random multipartite graph with p parts generated according to a given degree sequence. Vertices have vector degrees and each component of this vector is the number of neighbors of the vertex in the corresponding part of the graph. We assume that the degree sequence converges to a probability distribution. Under certain mild regularity assumptions, we characterize the conditions under which, with high probability, there exists a giant component.
