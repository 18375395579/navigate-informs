Box 1002, Millersville, PA, 17551-0302, United States, skim@millersville.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mozart Menezes, Rongbing Huang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop a location model for a distribution center on a demand-populated unit line between two suppliers to minimize the production, inbound and outbound transportation costs of one unit of a product. We first assume that two suppliers?production costs are deterministic, and then consider a probabilistic version where the production cost of one supplier follows a distribution. We propose properties of optimal locations and also characterize some distributions under which the properties hold.</br>
