Title: Entropy-Based Freight Origin-Destination Synthesis<br>Author: Carlos Gonzalez-Calderon, Graduate Research Assistant, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8TH ST, JEC 4037, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, gonzac4@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ivan Sanchez-Diaz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This investigation proposes two entropy-maximization approaches to develop tour-based urban freight demand models that estimate origin-destination matrices from traffic counts. The first approach considers multiclass traffic with a User Equilibrium condition for trucks and passenger cars in the transportation network. The second approach takes advantage of the temporal aspect of traffic counts to incorporate time effects on freight vehicle tours.
