<br>Title: Lower Cost Arrival Operations under Optimized Profile Descent</br><br>Author: Senay Solak, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, solak@isenberg.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Heng Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We utilize a stochastic framework and derive optimal decision rules for sequencing and spacing flights during optimized profile descent operations. We further conclude that the expected annual savings can be around $29 million if such rules are adapted by the top ten major airports in the U.S. Of these savings, $24 million are expected to be direct savings for airlines due to reduced fuel usage, corresponding to a potential savings of 10-15% in fuel consumption over the current practice.</br>
