Since our NFG is a generalization of Myerson's announcement game, we use pairwise Nash stability (PNS) as the solution concept.   We prove that, although the price of anarchy of the static game is unbounded, our dynamics converge to PNS networks with constant efficiency ratio. For some utility functions, our dynamics converge to efficient networks.
