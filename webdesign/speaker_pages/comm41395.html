Title: A Location Model for Storage of Emergency Supplies to Respond to Technological Accidents in Bogota<br>Author: Raha Akhavan-Tabatabaei, Assistant Professor, Universidad de los Andes, Cra 1 Este #19A -40, Bogota, 00, 1111, Colombia, r.akhavan@uniandes.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): Ridley Santiago Morales Mahecha<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Prevention and Attention of Emergencies Fund of Bogota requires the opening of new warehouses where supplies are stored to respond to different types of emergencies. We propose a linear optimization model connected with ArcGIS to determine the optimal location of these warehouses in order to minimize the total costs, subject to covering at least a certain percentage of the affected people with a fixed radius of coverage. Results are evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
