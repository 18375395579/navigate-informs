Title: Tuberculosis and HIV Mortality, Modelling of Multivariate ZIP Distribution with Time Series<br>Author: Rasim Musal, Assistant Professor, Texas State University, 1611 West Fifth Street, Austin, TX, 78703, United States of America, rm84@txstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tevfik Aktekin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate the effect of poverty and inequality on HIV and Tuberculosis mortality in the 62 counties of NY with spatial effects. We quantify inequality with the Theil Index and poverty via the ratios of the two Census variables in each ZCTA. As with HIV, Tuberculosis is a rare cause of mortality and many of the counties have 0 counts. This provides the motivation for a joint zero inflated Poisson distribution Bayesian model with time.
