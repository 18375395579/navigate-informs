Title: Scheduling Subject to Fixed Job Sequences<br>Author: Bertrand Lin, Professor, National Chiao Tung University, 1001 Tahsueh Road, Hsinchu, 300, Taiwan - ROC, bmtlin@mail.nctu.edu.tw<br>Coauthor(s): Feng-Jang Hwang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In most scheduling problems, if job/operation sequences on the machines are known, then the best schedules corresponding to the given sequences can be easily derived. For some problems, determining such schedules is however non-trivial. This talk discusses several scheduling problems with this aspect by presenting dynamic programming algorithms and NP-hardness proofs. Some open questions concerning complexity status will be addressed, too.
