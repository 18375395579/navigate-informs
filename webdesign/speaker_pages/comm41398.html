Title: Distributed Parallel Process Particle Swarm Optimization on Fixed Charge Network Flow Problems<br>Author: Corey Clark, DeVry University, 4800 Regent Blvd, Irving, TX, 75063, United States of America, cclark@gametheorylabs.com<br>Coauthor(s): Charles Nicholson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a parallel process particle swarm optimization (PSO) on an HTML5 based dynamically distributed system and assess its performance as applied to the multicommodity fixed charge (MCFC) network flow problem.  The MCFC problem is motivated by a real-world cash management problem faced by large national banks and is NP-hard.  We compare the performance of a serial and distributed parallel process PSO implementation and empirically evaluate the optimality gap for multiple instances.
