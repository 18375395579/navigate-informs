Title: The Equal Tails: A Method to Elicit the Value Function<br>Author: Antonio Villasis, IESE Business School, Av. Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, avillacis@alumni.unav.es<br>Coauthor(s): Manel Baucells<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a modification of existing elicitation methods for risk attitudes. It keeps most of the simplicity of classic methods and mitigates the distorting effect of probability weighting. The essence of the method is to ensure that the extreme monetary outcomes of the prospects presented to the subjects are the same. Experimentally, we found smaller degrees of concavity for gains. Our findings are consistent with other methods developed to avoid the distortion of probabilities.
