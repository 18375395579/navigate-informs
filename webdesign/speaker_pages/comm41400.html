Title: Inflation, Incomplete Information and Optimal Portfolio<br>Author: Jussi Keppo, keppo@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alain Bensoussan, Suresh Sethi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider an optimal consumption and portfolio investment problem of an investor who is interested in maximizing his utility from terminal wealth subject to a random inflation in the consumption basket price. The investor receives noisy observations on the basket price from inflation measures and salary income. We test the model empirically.
