Title: Optimization of Freight Unloading & Reloading Operation with Time-window at Rail Intermodal Terminal<br>Author: Feng Wang, Researcher, Jackson State University, 1230 Raymond Rd, #900, Jackson, MS, 39204, United States of America, feng.wang@jsums.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lei Bu, Haitao Gong, Chuanzhong Yin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: An integer programming model is developed to optimize the transloading process of freight unloading from ship containers and reloading to railroad containers at rail intermodal terminal. The model introduces unloading and reloading time-window as an important constraint to be established by an integer programming method in an attempt to minimize the railroad container transport cost, while reducing container usage for the railroads by improving payload or cubic capacity utilization rate.
