Title: Allocating Flexible Servers with Switching Costs and Switching Times<br>Author: Maria Mayorga, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, Department of Industrial Engineering, 146 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634-0920, United States of America, MAYORGA@exchange.clemson.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We model a tandem queuing system allocating flexible servers to maximize throughput or minimize costs. In the collaborative case with switching costs we characterize the structure of the optimal policy, and present sensitivity analysis to show how the structure of the optimal policy changes.  Our results show that the policy losses its monotone structure in the case that holding costs at the first station are higher.  We also approximate the optimal policy when switching times are introduced.
