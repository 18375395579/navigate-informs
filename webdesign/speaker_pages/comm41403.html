Title: Integrated Pricing of Road and Power Networks Coupled by Electric Vehicles<br>Author: Fang He, University of Florida, Civil and Coastal Engineering, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, jayhe@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The deployment of electric vehicles will lead to more frequent and profound interaction between transportation and power systems. This paper analyzes the interaction between price of electricity and travel patterns of electric vehicles, and then develops mathematical models to determine optimal prices of electricity and roads to maximize social welfare associated with the coupled networks, under different authoritarian regimes.
