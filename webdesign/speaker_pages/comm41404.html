Don Taylor</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a design method for the simultaneous optimization of warehouse layout and control policies in a general warehouse environment. A screening and selection procedure is employed to reduce computational requirements. It is demonstrated that a robust improvement in performance can be obtained as measured by the average travel distances.</br>
