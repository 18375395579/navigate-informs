Title: Simultaneous Optimization of Warehouse Layout and Control Policies<br>Author: Kees Jan Roodbergen, Rotterdam School of Management, P.O. Box 1738, Rotterdam, 3000DR, Netherlands, kroodbergen@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Iris F.A. Vis, G. Don Taylor<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a design method for the simultaneous optimization of warehouse layout and control policies in a general warehouse environment. A screening and selection procedure is employed to reduce computational requirements. It is demonstrated that a robust improvement in performance can be obtained as measured by the average travel distances.
