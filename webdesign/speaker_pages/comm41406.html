Title: Back Pressure Methods for Network Coding Optimization<br>Author: Tracey Ho, Assistant Professor, California Institute of Technology, 1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, CA, 91125, United States, tho@caltech.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We show how back pressure methods, originally used to find asymptotically optimal solutions to multicommodity routing problems, can be generalized to network coding.  We overview our range of techniques covering multicast (intra-session) and non-multicast (inter-session) network coding, wired and wireless network models, and independent and correlated sources, and discuss in detail the non-multicast case.
