We present BIZ, the first sequential elimination IZ procedure with tight bounds on worst-case preference-zone probability of correct selection.  Tight bounds allow the procedure to produce solutions with less sampling effort.  In this talk, we extend previous results to the case with unknown and heterogeneous sampling variance.</br>
