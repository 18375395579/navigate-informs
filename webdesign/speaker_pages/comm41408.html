<br>Title: Handling Variety in Mixed-Model Assembly Supply Chain by Order Decoupling</br><br>Author: Xiaowei Zhu, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 2350 Hayward Street, RM 2250, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, xwzhu@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Jack Hu, Jin Feng</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A mixed-model assembly process is considered as a supply process in which customized parts are added to partially completed assemblages. As product variety increases, the part supply process can become quite challenging. We propose using order decoupling to minimize part variation rate, which improves the process to handle variety without mechanically moving the physical assemblages. Procedures are developed in deterministic and stochastic settings to accommodate possible sequence disruptions.</br>
