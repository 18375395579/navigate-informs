Title: First Place Winner: Spatial Scheduling and Resource Selection Problem:  Modeling, Algorithm, and Application in the Production Gang Scheduling for Railway Maintenance Operations<br>Author: Gang Li, PhD Student, The University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business, 1 University Station B6000, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, gang.li@mail.utexas.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Given a set of geographically-dispersed jobs with time windows and inter-job coordination requirements, we address the problem of assigning and routing resources to jobs and sequencing the jobs to minimize the total cost for deploying and re-positioning resources.  We formulate this combined routing-scheduling problem as a large-scale integer program, develop valid inequalities to strengthen the model, and report its successful application in the production gang scheduling problem for a major railway company in North America.  The model has been helping the company to save millions of dollars each year and significantly improve the quality of the company's maintenance operations.
