Incentive programs and pricing adjustments are introduced to offset these common costs incurred to service the customers. A central problem in designing these programs is establishing a justifiable cost allocation scheme. Furthermore, accurate estimates of cost-to-serve are valuable information to other marketing and operational decisions. In this paper we develop different mechanisms for the cost allocation problem. The appropriateness and key trade-offs of the mechanisms are also discussed on the basis of certain principles of equity and computational performance.</br>
