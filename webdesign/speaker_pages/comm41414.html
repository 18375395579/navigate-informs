Typical analysis or design approaches are to statically determine service capacity to achieve acceptable mean performance levels, such as mean number or time in queue, resulting in periods of poor service spikes and unattractive utilization-service-cost tradeoffs. We explore the use of control theory to adapt service capacities in healthcare systems to achieve desired mean and threshold performance levels under a variety of assumptions.</br>
