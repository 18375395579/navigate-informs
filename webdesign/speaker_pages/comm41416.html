A faulty sensor may or may not report a false reading. As a result, the network owner may not be able to clarify the status of every node. A node is called an ambiguous node, if it is not possible to clarify the status of that node with the current sensor reports. We propose an integer programming approach for finding the maximum number of ambiguous nodes subject to the sensor reports.</br>
