Title: (Almost) Optimal Coordination Mechanisms for Unrelated Machine Scheduling<br>Author: Yossi Azar, Professor, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052, United States of America, t-azar@microsoft.com<br>Coauthor(s): Vahab Mirrkoni, Kamal Jain<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate the influence of different algorithmic choices on the approximation ratio in selfish scheduling. Our goal is to design local policies that minimize the inefficiency of resulting equilibria. In particular, we design optimal coordination mechanisms for unrelated machine scheduling, and improve the known approximation ratio from m to log m where m is the number of machine.
