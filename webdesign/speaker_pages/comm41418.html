For each user, information provided by ATIS is valuable if its price is lower than the subjective gain from the information, and lower than the perceived cost of other information-acquisition means. The profit-maximizing and socially optimal prices of ATIS, which correspond to different levels of ATIS market penetration, are analyzed and computed for a real-world transportation system.</br>
