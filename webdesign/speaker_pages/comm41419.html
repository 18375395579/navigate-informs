Title: A Selective Broadcast Query Protocol for High-density Wireless Sensor Networks<br>Author: Jeffrey Kharoufeh, Associate Professor, Northeastern University, 334 Snell Engineering Center, Boston, MA, 02115, United States, jkharoufeh@coe.neu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Mann, Rusty Baldwin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a search protocol to facilitate queries for data and services in high-density wireless sensor networks. The objective is to minimize the total energy expenditure of the network by determining the optimal number of data/service replicates and the number of nodes that receive each query transmission.
