We show the solution is a lower bound on the total inventory cost of all policies. For the W model, we combine the base-stock setting with a priority backlog clearing policy. We implement our approach by simple search algorithms. Numerical experiments show that within a large subset of parameter space, the outcome is close to the lower bound and converges to it as the lead time increases.</br>
