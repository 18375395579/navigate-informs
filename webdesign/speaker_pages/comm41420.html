Title: An Analysis of Drug Shortages: Inventory Management and Contract Designs<br>Author: Justin Jia, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 509 Krannert Building, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, jia16@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hui Zhao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Drug shortages have recently been a critical problem faced by the pharmaceutical industry. In this study, we investigate the reasons for the shortages, derive optimal inventory policies for drug manufacturers, and design efficient contracts to mitigate the shortages. Our analysis captures key characteristics of drug shortages: frequent manufacturing disruptions, uncertain recovery duration from disruption, limited buyers' patience, low redundancy in capacity, and weak failure-to-supply clauses.
