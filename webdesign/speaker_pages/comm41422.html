This leads to an optimal stopping problem with stochastic timing constraint described by a moving barrier. Modeling price dynamics by a time-homogeneous diffusion, we express the optimal timing in terms of the associated drawdown process. We also compare our results to the liquidation problem under a fixed stop-loss barrier.</br>
