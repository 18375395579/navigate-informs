Title: Modeling and Analysis of Generalized Path-Restricted Robust Network Clusters<br>Author: Alexander Veremyev, NRC Research Associate, Air Force Research Laboratory, Building 13, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Eglin AFB, FL, United States of America, averemyev@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Vladimir Boginski<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Short path connectivity between each pair of nodes is an essential network property in different real-life settings. A k-club may not reflect certain path-connectivity requirements, i.e, some important pairs of network components may be required to have shorter communication paths than others, or to be dependent on the cluster size. Several possible generalizations of a k-club concept and new compact linear 0-1 programming models for identifying such network clusters are discussed in this talk.
