Title: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Manufacturing System with Multiple Products with Seasonal Demands<br>Author: Sanket Bhat, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States of America, sbhat2@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Krishnamurthy<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We analyze manufacturing firms that can vary production capacities and target inventory levels to adapt to seasonal demands for products. Based on a dynamic programming model, we characterize the structure of the optimal policies. We also identify the optimal production capacities and length of production runs for each season.
