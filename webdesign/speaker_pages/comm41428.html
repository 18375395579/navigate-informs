Title: A Comprehensive Approach for Estimating Freeway Time-Dependent O-D Demands<br>Author: Pei-Wei Lin, Assistant Professor, University of Missouri at Kansas City, Department of Civil Engineering, Kansas City, MO, 64110, United States, linp@umkc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gang-Len Chang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a comprehensive approach for estimating time-dependent origin-destination (O-D) distributions for a freeway corridor. The approach accounts for missing ramp traffic flows, an unavailable initial O-D set, and measurement errors. Numerical experimental results based on Maryland’s I-95 freeway corridor reveal the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
