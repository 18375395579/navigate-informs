Title: Dynamic Capacity Leasing and Order Processing in Intermodal Freight Transportation<br>Author: Ting Luo, UT Dallas, UT Dallas, Dallas, United States of America, tingluo2006@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Long Gao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a dynamic container leasing and load acceptance problem where both demand and capacity supply are random. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and investigate the impact of system parameters. Using real-world data, we quantify the performances of several widely used policies with that of the optimal policy.
