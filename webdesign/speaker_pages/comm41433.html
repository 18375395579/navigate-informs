Title: A Generalized Mu-c Rule for a K-competing Queues Model with Customer Impatience<br>Author: Herman Blok, PhD Student, Leiden University, Mathematical Institute, Niels Bohrweg 1, Leiden, 2333 CA, Netherlands, blokh1@math.leidenuniv.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Flora Spieksma, Sandjai Bhulai<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Without impatience it is known, that it is optimal to allocate the server to a queue according to the mu-c rule. The system can be modelled as an MDP with unbounded jump rates. There has been no systematic way to analyse such MDPs because these are not uniformisable.     However, using the newly developed technique Smoothed Rate Truncation, we can prove that under some extra conditions the mu-c rule is still optimal. Without these conditions the mu-c rule is not necessarily optimal.
