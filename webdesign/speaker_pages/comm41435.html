<br>Title: Fixed-Queue-Ratio Routing in Call Centers</br><br>Author: Itay Gurvich, PhD Student, Columbia Business School, Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, ig2126@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ward Whitt</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study large call centers with multiple customer classes and agent pools. In order to balance the service levels for the different classes, we propose a fixed-queue-ratio (FQR) routing scheme. Together with a very simple staffing rule, FQR is asymptotically optimal for minimizing the total staffing level subject to per-class service-level constraints. The asymptotic optimality is proved in the QED many-server heavy-traffic regime via state-space collapse.</br>
