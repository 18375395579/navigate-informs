Title: Performance Analysis of Queuing Networks via Robust Optimization<br>Author: Alexander Rikun, MIT - ORC, 72 Brookline St. apt 201, cambridge, ma, 02139, United States of America, alexander.rikun@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas, David Gamarnik<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new approach for performance analysis of queueing networks based on robust optimization. We apply our approach to tandem single class and multiclass single server queueing networks. In both cases we obtain explicit bounds on performance measures such as sojourn time and busy period.
