<br>Title: Optimal and Asymptotically Optimal Policies for Assemble-to-Order Systems</br><br>Author: Jeannette Song, Professor, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, jingsheng.song@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lijian Lu, Hanqin Zhang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider inventory replenishment policy and common component allocation rule for assemble-to-order (ATO) systems with non-identical leadtimes. We propose a policy and show that such policy is optimal under a certain condition. The policy is asymptotically optimal when the condition fails. We also present comparative statics and show that some commonly used heuristic policies can lead to significant optimality loss.</br>
