Title: Pareto Optimal Solutions for a Double Row Layout Problem<br>Author: Chase Murray, Assistant Professor, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States of America, ccm0022@auburn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xingquan Zuo, Alice E. Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a facility layout problem where rectangular machines of unequal size are placed on either side of an aisle.  Objectives include minimizing the total material flow cost and minimizing the facility area, with the added restriction that each pair of machines must observe a minimum required clearance.  Only problems of very small size may be solved optimally via commercial integer programming solvers.  Therefore, a new approach to estimating the Pareto front is proposed.
