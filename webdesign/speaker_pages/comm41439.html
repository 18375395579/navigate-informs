<br>Title: Cargo Prioritization and Terminal Allocation for Inland Waterway Disruptions</br><br>Author: Jingjing Tong, Ph.D. Candidate, University Of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, tong@email.uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Heather Nachtmann</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: For an ongoing project funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, we have developed a nonlinear binary integer program for cargo prioritization and terminal allocation problem (CPTAP) that minimizes the total value loss of the barge cargoes when the inland waterway is closed or reduced due to a disruption. The model delivery indicates the terminal that each disrupted barge is assigned to for offloading and the prioritized turn each barge takes at its assigned terminal.</br>
