Title: Modeling the Impact of Correlation on the Telemetry Location Problem<br>Author: Amit Verma, PhD Candidate, University of Iowa, S210 John Pappajohn Bus. Bldg, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, amit-verma@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ann Campbell<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Telemetry units can be used to gauge inventory levels at customers which can help prevent stockouts and unnecessary deliveries. If telemetry units are placed at some customers, knowledge of customer usage correlation can be used to provide better usage information for other customers. We present a model for the problem of where to place a limited number of telemetry units to minimize routing costs that involves customer usage correlation. We will present a heuristic and computational results.
