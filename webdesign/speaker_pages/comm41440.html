Title: Finding Near-optimal (r,nQ,T) Policies is Not Harder Than Solving Single-stage Problems<br>Author: Kevin Shang, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, Durham, NC, United States of America, khshang@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sean Zhou<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a periodic-review, serial inventory system in which each stage implements an echelon (r,nQ,T) policy. Two types of fixed costs are considered: one is associated with producing a batch, and the other is associated with each inventory review. The objective is to find policy parameters such that the total supply chain cost per period is minimized. We propose a near-optimal heuristic by solving a series of single-stage problems with the original problem data.
