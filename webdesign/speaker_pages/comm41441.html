Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming for an Energy Storage Problem<br>Author: Warren Scott, PhD, Princeton University, ORFE Departement, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, wscott@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We use approximate dynamic programming to solve an energy storage problem which combines wind turbines, an electricity storage device, and the electrical grid in order to satisfy a load.  For approximate policy iteration we compare least-squares Bellman error minimization, Bellman error minimization with instrumental variables, and projected Bellman error minimization. For direct policy search, we apply the approximate knowledge gradient framework to efficiently optimize the storage policy.
