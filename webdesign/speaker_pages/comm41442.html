Title: Modeling the Effect of Traffic Congestion on Commuter Path Choices<br>Author: Justin Yates, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, 415 Lawrence D. Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260-2050, jtyates@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mingzhe Li, Rajan Batta<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The standard approach for modeling commuters is to assume that O-D travel is based on criteria like shortest time, number of turns, and number of intersections. We show a convergence scheme accounting for congestion effects on shared links. Computational examples are based  on a sample road network in Northridge, California.
