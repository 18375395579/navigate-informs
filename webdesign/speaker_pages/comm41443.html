<br>Title: Managing Locomotives in Freight Rail Transportation Systems</br><br>Author: Mervat Chouman, Universit?de Montréal, C.P. 6128, succ. Centre-ville, Montréal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada, mervat@crt.umontreal.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Teodor Gabriel Crainic</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The problem concerns the planning of locomotive fleet management for a freight rail carrier. It consits in assigning a set of heterogeneous locomotives to scheduled trains, such that all trains have the required power during their entire journay, while a number of restrictions, e.g. power availability and maintenance rules, are satisfied. We present an integer formulation and propose a heuristic approach to obtain high-quality solutions.</br>
