Title: Port and Modal Allocation of Waterborne Containerized Imports from Asia to the United States<br>Author: Rob Leachman, Professor, UC Berkeley, Dept. of Indus Engr & Oper Res, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1777, United States, leachman@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This economic optimization model allocates imports to alternative ports and logistics channels so as to minimize total transportation and inventory costs for each importer. Logistics channels include direct shipment of marine containers as well as warehousing and trans-loading in the hinterlands of the ports of entry. The model has been applied by West Coast policymakers to predict changes in container flows resulting from potential infrastructure improvements and user fees.
