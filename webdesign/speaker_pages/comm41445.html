Title: A Stochastic Programming Approach to a Multi-or Surgery Allocation Problem<br>Author: Sakine Batun, Research Assistant, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, sab79@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, Brian Denton<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a stochastic programming model to solve the multiple operating room (OR) scheduling problem with surgeon constraints, setup times, and uncertain surgery durations.  We consider performance measures such as fixed cost of opening ORs, overtime and surgeon idle time. We present computational results based on real data.
