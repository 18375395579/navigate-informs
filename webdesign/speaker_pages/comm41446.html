Title: Pareto-improving Congestion Pricing on Multimodal Transportation Networks<br>Author: Di Wu, University of Florida, Department of Civil & Coastal Engineering, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, thu.woody@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin, Siriphong Lawphongpanich<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper determines a pricing scheme to maximize the social benefit without increasing any individual user's travel cost or transportation authority's expense on a multimodal transportation network with transit services, high-occupancy/toll and regular lanes. The Pareto improvement is achieved by designing transit fares and highway link tolls to optimally distribute travel demand among the available modes. A multimodal Pareto-improving toll model is presented with numerical examples.
