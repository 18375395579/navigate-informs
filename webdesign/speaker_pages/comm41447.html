A market environment is considered where producers and consumers trade freely electric energy through a pool. The target of the transmission planner, modeled through the upper problem, is both to maximize global social welfare and to minimize network investment cost. This upper problem is constrained by a collection of market clearing problems representing pool trading, and whose objective functions correspond to social welfare.
