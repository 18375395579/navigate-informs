<br>Title: Air Cargo Load Planning: A Rule-based Optimization Approach</br><br>Author: Chunhua Tian, Advisory R&D Engineer, IBM China Research Lab, Diamond Building, ZGC Software Park 19#, ShangDi, Beijing, BJ, 100193, China, chtian@cn.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Feng Li, Hao Zhang, Wade Kelley</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: To provide the flexibility to change business logic a rule based optimization approach is proposed. High-level business logic is captured as a rule flow. Optimization algorithms (such as bin assign) are embedded as the action of the rule flow. With this approach, a loading plan can be adaptive to business changes without changing the application code. Our implementation includes a visual rule editor and rule engine. The system has successfully been applied at a North American airline company.</br>
