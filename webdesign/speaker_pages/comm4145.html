Title: Multi-OR Surgery Scheduling Problem with Surgeon Constraints<br>Author: Andrew Schaefer, Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, schaefer@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hari Balasubramanian, Sakine Batun, Brian Denton, Todd Huschka<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Allocation and scheduling of surgeries in a multiple operating room (OR) environment is one of the important operational problems in hospitals. For this problem, we present a stochastic programming model with surgeon constraints, setup times and uncertain surgery durations. We consider performance measures such as fixed cost of opening ORs, overtime and surgeon idle time. We present computational results based on real data.
