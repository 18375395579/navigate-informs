<br>Title: Brand Recognition in a Networked Digital World</br><br>Author: Jeongha Cath Oh, University of Washington Business School, Box 353200, Seattle, WA, 98195-3200, United States, jhoh@u.washington.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Sustaining constant demand and achieving channel recognition are especially difficult for online portal sites. The popularity of individual content guarantees neither increased demand nor regular visits. In this paper, we analyze a dataset collected from YouTube.com. Setting the number of subscribers to a channel as the dependent variable, and individual network measures as independent variables, we investigate the dynamics of channel selection by users in networked digital channels.</br>
