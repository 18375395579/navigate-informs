Title: Dynamic Leadtime Quotation Under General Customer Utilities<br>Author: Tava Olsen, Associate Professor, Washington University in St. Louis, 1 Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States, olsen@wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Baris Ata<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a make-to-order system where customers have explicit utility functions for leadtimes. Customers are dynamically quoted leadtimes; if the benefits of service do not exceed customers' disutility for waiting then they leave. We examine strategies for leadtime quotation under a variety of assumptions on the shape of the leadtime utility by appealing to approximations in the large-capacity asymptotic regime.
