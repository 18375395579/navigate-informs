<br>Title: A Risk-averse Differential Game Approach to Multiagent Routing and Formation with Stochastic Targets</br><br>Author: Khanh Pham, Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate, 3550 Aberdeen Ave., S.E., Kirtland Air Force Base, NM, 87117, United States of America, Khanh.Pham@kirtland.af.mil</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This talk considers a class of distributed stochastic multiagent systems where local interconnections among self-directed agents are determined by the use of graph theory. Associated with self-directed agents are finite-horizon performance measures for conflict-free routing and cohesive target tracking. It is shown that risk-averse agents effectively employ decentralized compensators driven by local noisy observations and timely implement output-feedback Nash policies for distributed decisions.</br>
