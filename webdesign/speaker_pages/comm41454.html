Title: A Diffusion Regime with Nondegenerate Slowdown<br>Author: Rami Atar, Assoc. Professor, Technion, Department of Electrical Engineering, Haifa, 32000, Israel, atar@ee.technion.ac.il<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In both the conventional and the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic diffusion regimes, the slowdown (i.e. the sojourn time/ service time ratio) degenerates in the limit, to infinity and 1, respectively. In practice, however, delay and service time are often comparable. We consider a diffusion regime in which delay and service time are of the same order of magnitude and, in a setting with many heterogenous servers, find the limiting joint law of these two processes.
