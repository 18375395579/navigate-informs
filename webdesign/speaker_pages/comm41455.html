Title: Fully Distribution-free Inventory Management<br>Author: Michael Wagner, California State University East Bay, 25800 Carlos Bee Blvd, Hayward, CA, United States of America, michael.wagner@csueastbay.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a multiple period inventory management problem with period-dependent fixed and variable ordering costs, holding costs and shortage costs. Demands are unknown and probabilistic forecasts are  available. We design robust inventory procurement policies with provable worst-case performance guarantees. Furthermore, these policies are flexible without sacrificing the performance guarantee.
