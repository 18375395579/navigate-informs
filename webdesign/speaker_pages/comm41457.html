Our approach is computationally efficient for large numbers of machines and products, and guaranteed to have cost no worse than 2 times optimal.  We depart from traditional considerations of clusters, or groups of machines purchased together, by introducing a novel quasi-separable resolution scheme for decomposing the cost to the system by machine types.</br>
