Title: Time Changed Markov Processes in United Credit-equity Modeling<br>Author: Rafael Mendoza, PhD Student, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd.

We model the stock price process as a time changed Markov process with state-dependent local volatility and killing rate. When the time change is a Levy process in turn time changed with a time integral of an activity rate process, the stock price process has state-dependent jumps, stochastic volatility and default intensity.
