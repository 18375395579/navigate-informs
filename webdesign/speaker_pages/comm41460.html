Title: Optimizing Wavelet Functions for Biomedical Diagnostic Applications<br>Author: Hui Yang, School of Industrial Engineering and Management, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering, Stillwater, OK, 74075, United States, hui.yang@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Most biomedical signals emerge from complex systems that exhibit low-dimensional chaotic dynamics. The recurrence properties of the dynamics are used to design a wavelet function that yields over two orders of magnitude more compact representation.
