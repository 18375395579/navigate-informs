<br>Title: A Facility Location Model with Safety Stock Costs: Analysis of the Cost of Single-sourcing Requirements</br><br>Author: Semra Agrali, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, sagrali@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zeki Caner Taskin, Joseph Geunes</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain setting in which multiple facilities serve a set of customers with uncertain demands. Each facility has an associated fixed cost, and incurs safety stock and variable supply costs. We propose a MINLP model and provide a Benders' decomposition algorithm for the case in which a customer's demand may be split among an arbitrary number of facilities. We provide computational results that permit characterizing the costs that arise from a single-sourcing strategy.</br>
