Title: Using Scenario Trees and Progressive Hedging for Stochastic Inventory Routing Problems<br>Author: Lars Magnus Hvattum, Molde University College, Britveien 2, Molde, -, 6411, Norway, lars.m.hvattum@himolde.no<br>Coauthor(s): Arne Løkketangen, Gilbert Laporte<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) the goal is to coordinate inventory replenishment and transportation in order to minimize costs. We look at Stochastic IRPs, where the customers have stochastic demands, and where the overall problem being formulated as a discounted, infinite-horizon Markov Decision Process. Here we focus on applying the Progressive Hedging Algorithm as a heuristic for solving finite scenario trees that are used to approximate the Markov Decision Process.
