<br>Title: A Proactive International Shipment Consolidation Strategy</br><br>Author: Wooseung Jang, Professor, University of Missouri, E3437 Lafferre Hall, Columbia, MO, 65211, United States of America, jangw@missouri.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Na Deng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider an integrated multi-commodity consolidation and shipping problem, which occurs in an international supply network. We propose a proactive strategy that consolidates shipment, considering both ocean and subsequent inland transportation activities. A combinatorial optimization model is proposed and numerical analysis shows significant cost savings of our approach.</br>
