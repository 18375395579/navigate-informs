Rothblum</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a problem of scheduling activities of a research and development project, where precedence relations of the activities constituting the project are represented by edges of an in-forest. The problem is to find a policy for attempting activities that minimizes the expected utility incurred until termination (successful completion of the project or first activity failure). We design an efficient algorithm to find an optimal sequence, and show that an optimal index policy may not exist.</br>
