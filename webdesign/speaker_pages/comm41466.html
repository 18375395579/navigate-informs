Title: Is Robust Optimization Too Conservative?<br>Author: Reha Tutuncu, Vice President, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, 32 Old Slip, 23rd Floor, New York, NY, 10007, United States, reha.tutuncu@gs.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A common objective in robust optimization is to optimize decisions under worst possible realizations of uncertain input parameters. These formulations typically lead to overly conservative choices. This conservatism is the result of allowing unlikely scenarios in the uncertainty sets. For the case where the uncertain parameters are estimates, we explore the use of restricted sets that respect their statistical properties. We illustrate the approach using portfolio selection examples.
