Box 751, Portland, OR, 97207-0751, United States of America, figliozzi@pdx.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Feng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We integrate several sources of data including bus automatic vehicle location (AVL), automatic passenger count (APC),  SCATS signal timing data and traffic movement data at each intersection along a corridor.  We present the results of regression models that  quantify the joint impacts of traffic conditions, adaptive traffic signal control, transit signal priority and bus stop location (near-side or far-side bus stops) on bus travel times.</br>
