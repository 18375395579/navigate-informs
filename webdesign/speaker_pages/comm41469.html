<br>Title: Design Issues in Service Systems with a Mix of Dedicated and Cross-trained Servers</br><br>Author: Eylem Tekin, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, eylem@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wallace Hopp, Mark Van Oyen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider pools of dedicated and cross-trained servers working in parallel. We first discuss the policies for customer routing. Then, we investigate how various system parameters such as the number of servers, arrival rates, and service times affect the decisions related to cross-training.</br>
