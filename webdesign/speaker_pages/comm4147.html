<br>Title: Adaptive Online Allocation Mechanisms for Single-Valued Domains</br><br>Author: David Parkes, Associate Professor, Harvard University, 33 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States, parkes@eecs.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satinder Singh</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a model of adaptive online mechanisms for bidders with single-valued types in a dynamic environment. Strong monotonicity and frugality are recognized as sufficient structural properties on allocation policies for dominant-strategy equilibrium, leading to adaptive, allocatively-efficient mechanisms.</br>
