Title: Adaptive Online Allocation Mechanisms for Single-Valued Domains<br>Author: David Parkes, Associate Professor, Harvard University, 33 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States, parkes@eecs.harvard.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satinder Singh<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a model of adaptive online mechanisms for bidders with single-valued types in a dynamic environment. Strong monotonicity and frugality are recognized as sufficient structural properties on allocation policies for dominant-strategy equilibrium, leading to adaptive, allocatively-efficient mechanisms.
