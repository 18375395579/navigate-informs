<br>Title: A Stochastic Integer Program for Fuel Optimal Conflict Resolution over Predefined Trajectories</br><br>Author: Adan Vela, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, aevela@gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this study we consider the air conflict resolution problem.   An    optimization model is developed to minimize expected fuel costs while issuing requested arrival times into the air space and speed commands    to aircraft over predefined trajectories to avoid conflict.     Particular focus is given to the uncertainty in arrival times of    aircraft into the airspace.  The resulting program is a two-stage    stochastic integer program.</br>
