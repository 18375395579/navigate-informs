Effective port security screening policies are needed to reduce the risk from potential threats and ensure port productivity. An interactive simulation model is constructed for port policy makers to compare alternative screening policies. The model integrates disruptions from multiple threats such as terrorist attack, bombs, and hijacking. An experiment is carried to identify better port security screening strategies.</br>
