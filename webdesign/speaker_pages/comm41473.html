As there can be players controlling a significant fraction of the flow, these games readily applies to competition among freight companies and telecommunication network service providers. We analyze the worst-case inefficiency of Nash equilibria and conclude although self-interested competitors will not in general achieve a fully efficient solution, the loss is not too severe.</br>
