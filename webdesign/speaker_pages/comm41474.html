Title: Development and Numerical Analysis of a K-Short Path Ranking Algorithm<br>Author: Xianbiao Hu, Research Assistant, University of Arizona, 1209 E. 2nd Street, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, xbhu@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chang Chiu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this research a k-Shortest Paths Ranking (SPR) algorithm is proposed to find k shortest paths between two given OD pairs based on a defined similarity degree. The similarity degree is used to regulate the similarity/overlapping of these k shortest paths. Numerical analysis conducted on the Tucson network show satisfactory results of the proposed algorithm.
