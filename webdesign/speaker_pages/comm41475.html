Title: How to Extend an Inner Product Embedding<br>Author: Michael Trosset, Professor, Indiana University, Department of Statistics, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States, trosset@math.wm.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: It is well known that squared Euclidean distances can be transformed to Euclidean inner products.  Classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS) applies this transformation to squared dissimilarities, then approximates the resulting matrix with a matrix of inner products.  Suppose that, after CMDS has been performed, we observe dissimilarities of new objects from the original objects.  We consider how to embed the new objects without disturbing the original configuration.
