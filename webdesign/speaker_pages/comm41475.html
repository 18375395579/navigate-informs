Classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS) applies this transformation to squared dissimilarities, then approximates the resulting matrix with a matrix of inner products.  Suppose that, after CMDS has been performed, we observe dissimilarities of new objects from the original objects.  We consider how to embed the new objects without disturbing the original configuration.</br>
