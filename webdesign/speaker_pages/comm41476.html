Title: The Impacts of Area-covering Disruptions in Road Networks<br>Author: Erik Jenelius, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Teknikringen 78B, Stockholm, --, SE-100 44, Sweden, jenelius@infra.kth.se<br>Coauthor(s): Lars-Göran Mattsson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Events such as snow storms and earthquakes can affect extended areas of the transport system. We present a systematic methodology for analyzing the consequences of such events. The studied road network is covered with grids of varying sizes and positions, where each square represents a disrupting event. The consequences, in terms of travel time increases, of each disruption are then calculated for different regions. The methodology is applied to the Swedish road network.
