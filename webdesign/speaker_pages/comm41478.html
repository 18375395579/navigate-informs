<br>Title: On The Use of Automatic Differentiation  to Efficiently Determine First and Second Derivatives in Fi</br><br>Author: Thomas Coleman, Professor and Ophelia Lazaridis University Research Chair, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, Canada, tfcoleman@uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): xi chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many applications in finance require the efficient computation of the first derivatives (i.e., “Greeks? and sometimes 2nd derivatives of pricing functions of financial instruments.  In this talk we illustrate how these popular pricing models exhibit structure that can be exploited, to achieve significant efficiency gains, in the application of automatic differentiation to compute 1st and 2nd derivatives of these models.</br>
