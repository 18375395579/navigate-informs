<br>Title: Dynamic Production and Inventory Transshipment Policies for a Two-Location Make-to-Stock System</br><br>Author: Jennifer Ryan, Assistant Professor, University of Notre Dame, Mendoza College of Business, Department of Management, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, United States, jryan8@nd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Zhao, Vinayak Deshpande</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study inventory transshipment in a two-location make-to-stock system with exponential production times. Transshipments may be triggered by both demand arrivals and production completions, i.e., transshipment is used to achieve production flexibility and to fill emergency demands. We prove the structure of the optimal production and demand filling policies. Finally, we develop easy-to-implement heuristics which work very well for a range of cost parameters.</br>
