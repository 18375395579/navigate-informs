Title: Minimizing Makespan in Two-Machine Flowshops with Exact Delays<br>Author: Joseph Leung, Distinguished Professor, New Jersey Institute of Computer Science, Department of Computer Science, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States, leung@oak.njit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hairong Zhao, Haibing Li<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider two-machine flowshops with exact delays with the goal of minimizing the makespan. We first show that the problem is strongly NP-hard even if there are only two delay values. We then show that some special cases are solvable in polynomial time. Finally, we design constant approximation algorithms for the general case.
