The idea is to increase the tabu list length when the tabu memory indicates that the search is revisiting formerly traversed solutions. Once too many repetitions are encountered an escape meachanism coonstituting a random walk is an essential part of the method. We propose to replace this random walk by a controlled simulated annealing. Excellent results are presented for various combinatorial optimization problems.</br>
