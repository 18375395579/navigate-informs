Title: Hybridizing Reactive Tabu Search with Simulated Annealing<br>Author: Stefan Voss, Chair and Director of the Institute of Information Systems within the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, University of Hamburg, IWI, Von-Melle-Park 5, Hamburg, HG, 20146, Germany, stefan.voss@uni-hamburg.de<br>Coauthor(s): Andreas Fink<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Reactive Tabu Search aims at the automatic adaptation of the tabu list length. The idea is to increase the tabu list length when the tabu memory indicates that the search is revisiting formerly traversed solutions. Once too many repetitions are encountered an escape meachanism coonstituting a random walk is an essential part of the method. We propose to replace this random walk by a controlled simulated annealing. Excellent results are presented for various combinatorial optimization problems.
