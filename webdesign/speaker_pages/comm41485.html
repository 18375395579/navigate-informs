<br>Title: Optimal Design of Storage Facility in Bio-ethanol Supply Chain under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Yongxi Huang, Graduate Student, University of California, Institute of Transportation Studies, Davis, 95616, United States of America, yxhuang@ucdavis.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yueyue Fan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The design of ethanol production system using biomass is subjected to feedstock seasonality and highly uncertain future demands.  A multistage stochastic model is proposed in this paper for optimal design and operation of biorefineries as well as storage facilities for both feestocks and fuels, in order to enhance the system reliability and efficiency of the entire ethanol supply chain.</br>
