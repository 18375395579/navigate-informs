<br>Title: Analysis of Multivariate Loss Functions under Preferential and Statistical Dependencies</br><br>Author: Leman Esra Dolgun, Anadolu University, Anadolu University Industrial, Engineering Department, Eskisehir, Turkey, ledolgun@anadolu.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Levent Eriskin, Gülser Köksal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: One of the challenging problems in quality management is simultaneous consideration of multiple quality responses in selection of design parameter levels for robust products. Multivariate loss functions are widely used in this type of multiresponse optimization problems. We present results of analyses we have conducted on the ability of multivariate loss functions to incorporate predefined preferential and statistical dependence structures among responses.</br>
