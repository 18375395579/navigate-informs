Title: Bias and Variance Reduction for Assessing Solution Quality in  Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Rebecca Stockbridge, University of Arizona, 617 N Santa Rita Ave, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, rstockbridge@math.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guzin Bayraksan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a computational study of bias and variance reduction methods applied to the optimality gap estimators produced by the Multiple Replications Procedure. Techniques discussed include Latin Hypercube sampling, antithetic variates, and randomized quasi-Monte Carlo for variance reduction, and a probability metrics approach to bias reduction.
