<br>Title: Approximation of Discrete Distributions: Model Randomization and Building Scenarios</br><br>Author: Stan Uryasev, Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, uryasev@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Konstantin Pavlikov</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We approximate a discrete random variable by some other discrete random variable with unknown probabilities of outcomes.  The probabilities of atoms of the new distribution are obtained  by minimizing Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kantorovich, and CVaR absolute distance between distributions. We consider two applications: 1) Randomizing deterministic models in Financial Engineering; 2) Constructing scenarios for stochastic programming.</br>
