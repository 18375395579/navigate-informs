Title: A Generalized Random Adaptive Search Procedure for Solving Airspace Congestion Problems<br>Author: Christine Taylor, Senior Simulation Modeling Engineer, The MITRE Corporation, 7515 Colshire Drive, M/S N450, McLean, VA, 22102, United States of America, ctaylor@mitre.org<br>Coauthor(s): Craig Wanke<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This research implements a Generalized Random Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) for resolving airborne congestion problems. An existing congestion resolution algorithm produces an ordered list of candidate flights, where position in the order influences the likelihood of getting an undesirable resolution maneuver. Utilizing GRASP to create the ordered list enables sort orders to be perturbed slightly and thereby provide a view of the neighboring decision space, resulting in improved solutions.
