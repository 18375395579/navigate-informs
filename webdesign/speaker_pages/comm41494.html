Here, goods have to be delivered under extreme time pressure because of their high perishability. Thus, the minimization of service time, i.e., the time difference between request arrival and request delivery, has to be integrated into the objective function. A new real-time approach is proposed where forecasted demands are integrated into dynamic tour planning by the generation of artificial requests.</br>
