Title: Fluid Limit of Transport Processes, and Applications to Queues with Impatient Customers<br>Author: Pascal Moyal, CEREMADE- Universit?Paris Dauphine, Place du Maréchal DeLattre de Tassigny, Paris, 75016, France, pascal.moyal@ceremade.dauphine.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Laurent Decreusefond<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study a queueing system with impatient customers, represented by a measure-valued process keeping track of the residual time-credits of the customers. This process is a Feller Process whose generator emphasises an integral transport equation. We prove the convergence in distribution of a normalized sequence of such processes towards a fluid limit using compactness/uniqueness techniques, and apply this result to derive the fluid limits of the congestion and lost processes in some cases.
