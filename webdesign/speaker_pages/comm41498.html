<br>Title: Lead-Time Estimation with Minimum Batch Sizes</br><br>Author: Susan Slotnick, Associate Professor, Cleveland State University, 2121 Euclid Avenue, BU 542, Cleveland, OH, 44115, United States, slotnick@alltel.net</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This model estimates lead-times for a manufacturing system in which the bottleneck process requires a minimum batch size. Customer delivery promise dates take into account processing time, queueing time and time for arrival of the requisite volume to complete the minimum batch size requirement. This research is motivated by the scheduling process of an integrated steel mill.</br>
