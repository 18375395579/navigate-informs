Title: Solving Cancer Drug Shortage- A Chance Constrained Model<br>Author: Shanling Li, Professor, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, PQ, H3A1G5, Canada, shanling.li@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Xiaowen Chang, Huifu Xu, Dali Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Drug shortages have been major concern to cancer patients. In this research, we propose to develop a chance-constrained model to describe cancer drug shortage problem and in the model, we consider demand uncertainty for cancer drugs, uncertain availability of generic drug supplies and some operational issues such as purchasing and inventory holding costs.  The objective is to minimize total expected cost.  We present the computational techniques to simplify solution procedures.
