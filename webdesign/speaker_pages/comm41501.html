Title: Efficient Routing on Large-scale Dynamic Networks under ITS Using Hierarchical Communities<br>Author: Mahyar Movahednejad, PhD Candidate, Wayne State University, Manufacturing Engineering Building, 4815 Fourth St., Detroit, MI, 48202, United States of America, mahyar@wayne.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ratna Babu Chinnam<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We employ an emerging concept in analyzing complex networks called “community structure detection?to capture traffic network dynamics in the form of hierarchical community-based representations of road networks. We then develop hierarchical routing algorithms to the extracted hierarchical network. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approaches using actual road network data from Southeast Michigan.
