Title: Tandem Lines with Collaborative Flexible Servers<br>Author: Hayriye Ayhan, Associate Professor, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States, hayhan@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sigrún Andradóttir, Doug Down<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consider a tandem queueing network with two stations, infinite supply of jobs in front of station 1, infinite room for completed jobs after station 2, finite buffer between stations, and two flexible servers. Under the assumption that two servers can work together on a single job, we study how the optimal dynamic server assignment policy changes as a function of how well these two servers work together.
