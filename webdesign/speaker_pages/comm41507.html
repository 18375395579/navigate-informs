Title: Managing Perishable Inventories in Retailing: Replenishment, Clearance Sales, and Segregation<br>Author: Peiwen Yu, Ph.D. Candidate, Hong Kong Univ of Science and Technology, ISOM Department, HKUST, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, freeypw@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Qing Li<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study joint replenishment and clearance sales of perishable goods under a general finite lifetime and a last-in-first-out (LIFO) issuing rule, a problem common in retailing. We show the structure of the optimal policy and propose simple myopic heuristics that require only partial age information.
