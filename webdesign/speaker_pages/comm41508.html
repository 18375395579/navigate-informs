<br>Title: Scheduling Policies in the M/G/1 Make-to-Stock Queues</br><br>Author: Baris Balcioglu, Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, Canada, baris@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nima Sanajian</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We exploit the distributional Little's law to obtain the exact numerical solution for the  M/G/1 system size distribution. Considering multiple-demand types, we explore the performance of three static scheduling rules, namely, FCFS, non-preemptive and preemptive priority rules. We provide the conditions to see when a make-to-order queue would be the optimal discipline. Finally, we extend our analysis by adjusting a well-known dynamic scheduling policy, i.e. myopic-T, for the M/G/1 queue.</br>
