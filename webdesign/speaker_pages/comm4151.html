Title: Inventory Model with Setup Cost Under Uncertain Demand and Supply<br>Author: Yusen Xia, Assistant Professor, Georgia State University, Robinson College of Business, Atlanta, GA, 30303, United States, mgtyxx@langate.gsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Annabelle Feng<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Although there is an extensive literature on inventory systems with random yields in various contexts, little is known about the ordering strategy with setup costs under demand and yield uncertainties. We formulate a periodic review inventory model and characterize the optimal policy in three segments of the on-hand inventory. Given the complexity of the optimal policy, we propose a simple piecewise linear policy which demonstrates good cost performance in our computational study.
