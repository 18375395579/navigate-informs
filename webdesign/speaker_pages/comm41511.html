The CPP is to design an optimal annual timetable to complete a given set of repairs and replacement jobs(rail and tie-work) on the tracks for the teams specialized in rail or tie-work such that the disruptions of the trains caused by station-curfews is minimized. We give three formulations for the CPP:(i)Time-space network, (ii)Duty-Generation, and (iii)Column-generation.
