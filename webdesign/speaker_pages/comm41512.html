<br>Title: Radio Frequency and Time-slot assignment in Mobile Adhoc Networks: An Exact Mathematical Solution</br><br>Author: David Foroudi, Ph.D., Consultant, Greater Los Angeles Area, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, adforoudi@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Consider a centrally managed network of multi-band/multi-mode radios, required to broadcast messages with their neighboring nodes at distinct frequencies/time-slots and under several bottleneck constraints. We developed mathematical model in MPL/CPLEX for assigning frequencies to radios at each timeslot, formulated as bottleneck generalization of the famous Map Coloring problem in Combinatorial Optimization. We were able to solve this quickly even though computational complexity is NP-Complete.</br>
