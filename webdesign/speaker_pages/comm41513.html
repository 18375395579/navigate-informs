Title: Group-strategyproof Mechanisms for Network Design Games<br>Author: Jochen Konemann, Kunlun Tan Department of Combinatorics and Optimization University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, jochen@math.uwaterloo.ca<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk we first define a class of cost-sharing games arising  from network design optimization problems. We then show how  group-strategyproof (i.e., collusion resistant) mechanisms for such  games can be derived from existing primal-dual algorithms for the  underlying optimization problems in an automatic way.
