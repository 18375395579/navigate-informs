<br>Title: The G/GI/N Queue in the Halfin-Whitt Regime</br><br>Author: Josh Reed, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, je-reed@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Consider the G/GI/N queue in the Halfin-Whitt regime. Our first result is to obtain a one dimensional limiting approximation for the properly centered and scaled queue length process. We then proceed to establish an equivalent characterization of our limiting process involving the renewal function associated with the service time distribution. Finally, we conclude by discussing several interesting directions for future research.</br>
