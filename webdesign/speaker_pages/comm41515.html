Title: Some Continuity Properties of Affine Variational Inequalities<br>Author: Stephen Robinson, Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, ISyE/UW-MADISON, 1513 University Ave Rm 4161A, Madison, WI, 53706-1539, United States, smrobins@wisc.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present some results about continuity of solutions of affine variational inequalities when the polyhedral convex sets over which they are posed may change. Certain matrix classes make these properties possible, and we demonstrate some of these relationships. This permits identification of entire classes of problems whose solutions remain stable when resource or performance constraints change.
