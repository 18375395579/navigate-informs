We now show that time-expanded or dynamic graph networks are   instances of the GTCTM, thus the GTCTM is a generalized dynamic graph   structure. Moreover, inspired by known concepts from the building   evacuation problem, we show that for the single destination GTCTM three   commonly used optimization objectives are equivalent.</br>
