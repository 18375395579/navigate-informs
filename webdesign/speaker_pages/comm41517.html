<br>Title: Kidney Exchange in Dynamic Sparse Heterogenous Pools</br><br>Author: Vahideh Manshadi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, manshadi@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Itai Ashlagi, Patrick Jaillet</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Current kidney exchange pools are of moderate size and thin, as they consist of many highly sensitized patients. Creating a thicker pool can be done by waiting for many pairs to arrive. We analyze a class of algorithms that search periodically for allocations. We perform sensitivity analysis on the amount of waiting given different types of allocations (i.e., using 2-ways, 3-ways, or chains). Our theoretical findings and data-driven computational experiments lead to policy recommendations.</br>
