<br>Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming for a Spare Parts Problem: The Challenge of Rare Events</br><br>Author: Hugo Simao, Research Engineer, CASTLE Lab - Princeton University, EQUAD E220 - Olden St., Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, hpsimao@princeton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: An aircraft manufacturer needed to design an inventory policy for high-value spare parts (engines, avionics) where small numbers of parts need to be stored at different distribution centers to respond to random, infrequent demands.  Demands may be handled by multiple distribution centers.  Failed parts are refurbished, while new parts can take months to arrive.  We describe the computational challenges arising with the design of an ADP strategy.</br>
