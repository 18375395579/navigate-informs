Title: An Effective Strategy for High Flexibility in Serial Production with Limited Multi-functionality<br>Author: Damon Williams, PhD Student, University of Michigan, IOE, 1205 Beal Ave, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, dpwillia@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dimitrios Pandelis, Mark Van Oyen, Jung-hee Lee<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A ?-skill chain?has high flexibility for the number of capabilities/skills (cf. Iravani, Van Oyen, and Sims M.S. 2005). We develop an effective approach with even less multifunctionality and provide effective policies and performance bounds.  Analytical structural properties are proven for policies of related classes of serial systems.
