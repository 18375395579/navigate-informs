Title: Robust Stochastic Lot-Sizing Using Historical Data<br>Author: Miao Song, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Room 1-236E, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, msong@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Diego Klabjan, David Simchi-Levi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the single-item multi-period periodic review stochastic lot-sizing model. Unlike the traditional setting of a given demand distribution, we assume only historical data and distribution fitting is captured in the model itself. We propose an integrated minimax robust model, and prove that the optimal inventory control policy of this model shares the same structure as the traditional stochastic counterpart.
