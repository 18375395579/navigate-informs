Title: Clinical Scheduling of Patients with Heterogeneous No-show Probabilities<br>Author: Mark Lawley, Purdue University, 206 S.

Our objective is to maximize the expected profit, which includes revenue, patient waiting time and physician overtime costs. We derive the properties of an optimal schedule. We propose a local search algorithm and two sequential scheduling algorithms. We show the significance of considering heterogeneous patients instead of homogeneous patients.
