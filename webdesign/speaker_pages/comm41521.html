Our objective is to maximize the expected profit, which includes revenue, patient waiting time and physician overtime costs. We derive the properties of an optimal schedule. We propose a local search algorithm and two sequential scheduling algorithms. We show the significance of considering heterogeneous patients instead of homogeneous patients.</br>
