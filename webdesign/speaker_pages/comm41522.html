Title: Optimal Resource Allocation in Processor-sharing Systems with Feedback<br>Author: Sandjai Bhulai, VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Sciences, De Boelelaan 1081a, Amsterdam, 1081 HV, Netherlands, s.bhulai@vu.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Chretien Verhoef<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a processor-sharing system with feedback in which the server capacity can be allocated over the different job classes to minimize the average number of jobs in the system. This seemingly simple model has a few peculiar properties. First, the optimal policy is an analogue of the SEPT policy. Second, numerical calculation of the optimal policy is hindered by boundary effects due to truncation of the state space. To resolve this problem, we develop a new numerical method.
