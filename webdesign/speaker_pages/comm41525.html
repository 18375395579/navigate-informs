Title: Airline Mergers and Air Transportation System Congestion<br>Author: Michael Ball, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, MBall@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the impact of consolidation within the US airline industry on air transportation system congestion.  Specifically, we argue that 1) market forces are pushing US carriers toward national footprints and that 2) mergers will tend to reduce redundant services in certain market and thus tend to reduce congestion.
