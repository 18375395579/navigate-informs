We assume Poisson arrivals and an exponential production time. Orders that are not satisfied immediately wait up to an exponentially distributed amount of time and abandon the system if not satisfied within this time. We show that the threshold inventory rationing policy is still optimal under certain conditions including a requirement on the order of abandonment rates.</br>
