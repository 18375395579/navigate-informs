We formulated the problem as a network flow problem. In the planning stage, we generated a number of dissimilar paths between every origin-destination pair based on the current urban infrastructure. Given the impact of the disaster on the current infrastructure and given the public response time, we identified routes for transit vehicles to minimize the total evacuation time.</br>
