Mikkola, Associate Professor, Copenhagen Business School, Dept. of Operations Management, Solbjerg Plads 3, Frederiksberg, DK, 2000, Denmark, jh.om@cbs.dk<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Increasing number of firms are benefiting from mass customization (MC). MC is realized through a combination of product architecture modularity strategies (i.e. product design for manufacturability) and postponement strategies (i.e. product design for distribution). This paper proposes a model to measure the degree of mass customization embedded in product architectures.
