Title: Non-FCFS Scheduling in Fluid Many-server Queues<br>Author: Petar Momcilovic, Associate Professor, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O.

In particular, we examine time-varying queues under the assumption that the scheduler knows realizations of customer patience/service times. Implementing a non-FCFS policy improves the overall system performance in terms of the number of customers that abandon during overloaded periods.
