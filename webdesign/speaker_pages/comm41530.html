<br>Title: Preferences for Health and Consumption: Putting Your Money Where Your Health Is</br><br>Author: Casey Lichtendahl, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia, PO Box 6550, Charlottesville, VA, 22906, United States of America, lichtendahlc@darden.virginia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Samuel Bodily</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Lifetime consumption planning requires preferences for health and consumption.  Desirable conditions on such preferences, including risk aversion in length of life and well-established notions for values and utilities of health, lead to two new multiplicative utility forms.  We apply them to consumption-planning problems with investments in bonds, stocks, and life annuities and show that they may be more desirable than typical additive forms.</br>
