Results confirm sequencing improves clinic performance in terms of patient's wait, doctor's idle time and overtime. While it is difficult to generalize the best sequencing policy, our study shows that a proposed universal Dome appointment rule performs consistently well across different clinical scenarios and cost valuations.
