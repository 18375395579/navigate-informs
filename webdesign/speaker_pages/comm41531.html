<br>Title: A Universal Appointment Rule for Patient Types, No-shows and Walk-ins</br><br>Author: Tugba Cayirli, Assistant Professor, Ozyegin University, Kusbakisi Cad. No: 2, Altunizade - Uskudar, Istanbul, 34462, Turkey, Tugba.Cayirli@ozyegin.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kum Khiong Yang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This study evaluates sequencing approaches that differentiate patient groups by their mean and variance of service times, no-show and walk-in probabilities. Results confirm sequencing improves clinic performance in terms of patient's wait, doctor's idle time and overtime. While it is difficult to generalize the best sequencing policy, our study shows that a proposed universal Dome appointment rule performs consistently well across different clinical scenarios and cost valuations.</br>
