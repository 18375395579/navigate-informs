Title: Emergency Inventory Pooling<br>Author: Jordan Tong, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 975 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, jtong@bus.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jing-Sheng Song, Fang Liu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Organizations contract with vendors to always maintain a minimum level of inventory for disaster preparedness. We consider the problem of how to manage this emergency inventory among multiple vendors. Instead of stockpiling, we show that a type of virtual pooling we call emergency inventory pooling can reduce costs. We identify the optimal policy and derive an algorithm for implementation. Finally, we examine for which firms and products emergency inventory pooling is most valuable.
