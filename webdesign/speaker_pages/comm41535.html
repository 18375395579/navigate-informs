Part requests can be fulfilled from multiple local warehouses via regular deliveries or from externally by an emergency shipment. We develop a dynamic heuristic via an approximate dynamic programming approach. This heuristic is close to optimal, has a low computational complexity, and significantly ourperforms a widely used, static rule.
