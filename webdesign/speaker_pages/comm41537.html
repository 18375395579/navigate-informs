Title: Area-Based Pricing<br>Author: Siriphong Lawphongpanich, Associate Professor, Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, PO Box 11-6595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, lawphong@ise.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk, we consider the problem of finding a one-time charge for using roads in a given area.  The objective is to reduce total travel time and the area need not be contiguous or form a cut-set.  However, when the area forms a cut-set and there are additional constraints on tollable roads, then the problem reduces to the cordon pricing problem in the literature.
