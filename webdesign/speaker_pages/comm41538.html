Title: Compostable and Efficient Mechanisms<br>Author: Vasilis Syrgkanis, PhD Student, Cornell University, Upson Hall, Dept. of Comp.Sci., Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, vasilis@cs.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eva Tardos<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We initiate the study of efficient mechanism design with guaranteed good properties when players participate in multiple different mechanisms simultaneously or sequentially. We define the class of smooth mechanisms and show that they result in high quality outcome in equilibrium both in the full information and in the Bayesian setting, as well as in learning outcomes. Our main result is to show that such mechanisms compose well: smoothness locally at each mechanism implies efficiency globally.
