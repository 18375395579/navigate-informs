We define the class of smooth mechanisms and show that they result in high quality outcome in equilibrium both in the full information and in the Bayesian setting, as well as in learning outcomes. Our main result is to show that such mechanisms compose well: smoothness locally at each mechanism implies efficiency globally.</br>
