We generalize this concept by considering a general linear filter as a control chart, with no restrictions on the number of filter parameters. We discuss how to tune the filter parameters with objectives such as:  i) optimizing performance in detecting process shifts and ii) ensuring reasonable robustness to errors in process parameters that must be estimated in Phase I.</br>
