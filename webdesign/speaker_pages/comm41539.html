Title: Linear Control Chart Filters: Performance Optimization and Robustness<br>Author: Dan Apley, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, Dept. of Industrial Engineering, 2145 Sheridan Rd., Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States of America, apley@northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many control charts can be viewed as charting the output of a linear filter applied to a sequence of observations. We generalize this concept by considering a general linear filter as a control chart, with no restrictions on the number of filter parameters. We discuss how to tune the filter parameters with objectives such as:  i) optimizing performance in detecting process shifts and ii) ensuring reasonable robustness to errors in process parameters that must be estimated in Phase I.
