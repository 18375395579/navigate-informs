Rovisco Pais, 1049-001 Lisboa, Portugal, cfb@isr.ist.utl.pt<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We correlate rate of entering traffic in Lisbon, Portugal, and the speed of buses. The admission rate was reduced by varying green and red light times at one entry point of the city, permitting buses on some routes to maintain constant average speed during rush hour, rather than dropping.
