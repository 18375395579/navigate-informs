Title: An Approximation Algorithm for the Frequent Itemset Hiding Problem<br>Author: Sumitra Mukherjee, Nova Southeastern University, Grad School of Computer & Information Sc, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33314, United States, sumitra@nova.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Laszlo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The frequent itemset hiding problem, in data mining, involves sanitizing transactions so that sensitive itemsets are hidden, while minimizing the number of nonsensitive itemsets hidden. We present and analyze an approximation algorithm for this problem, based on the local ratio framework.
