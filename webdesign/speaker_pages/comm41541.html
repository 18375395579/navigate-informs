<br>Title: Identifying the Critical Patient: Finding the Balance Between Undertriage and Overtriage</br><br>Author: Serhan Ziya, Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics and Operations Research University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, ziya@email.unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nilay Argon</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Two common mistakes during patient triage are undertriage and overtriage, which are assigning a patient respectively a lower and a higher priority than what the patient's condition actually requires. Although a certain level of undertriage and overtriage is unavoidable, one can choose to be lenient towards one way or the other. In this talk, we use queueing models to generate insights on how triage decisions need to be made so as to keep the right balance between undertriage and overtriage.</br>
