<br>Title: Periodic Inspection Optimization for Infrastructure Systems Subject to Hidden Failures</br><br>Author: Dzung Phan, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, phandu@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jayant Kalagnanam, Yada Zhu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A method for finding the periodic inspection interval for geo-distributed infrastructure systems subject to hidden failures is presented. We cluster the units of a system into groups, then calculate the optimal inspection interval for each group based on the expected cost per cycle. Finally, we determine the schedule for inspection by minimizing the total inspection cost subject to the labor and budget constraints. An integer nonlinear programming formulation and a heuristics are developed.</br>
