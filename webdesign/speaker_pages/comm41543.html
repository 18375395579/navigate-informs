Title: Better Online Buffer Management<br>Author: Jay Sethuraman, Associate Professor, Columbia University, Dept. of IEOR, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, js1353@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cliff Stein, Fei Li<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We design effective buffer management policies for network switches supporting Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Specifically, we consider a model in which each packet has a deadline by which it must be sent, and a value reflecting the payoff for sending it on-time. The goal is to maximize the value of the packets sent. In this talk, we shall discuss several online algorithms for this problem and some well-studied variants.
