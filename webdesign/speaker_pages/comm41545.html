These disruptions often continue for some hours. Train services need to be cancelled and others need to be delayed in order to compensate for the loss of network capacity. In particular, such disruptions typically lead to infeasibilities in the planned timetable, the rolling stock allocations and the crew duties. This requires the railway operator and the infrastructure manager to reschedule the timetable, and the rolling stock and crew schedules. In this research we focus on the rescheduling of the timetable at a macroscopic level. The formulation minimizes the number of cancelled and delayed trains while adhering to capacity constraints on the tracks and within the stations. The model ensures that there is rolling stock available for all trains in the resulting timetable.</br>
