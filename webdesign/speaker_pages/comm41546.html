Title: Impact of Time Sensitive Demand on Facilitiy Location<br>Author: Mozart Menezes, Assistant Professor, HEC - School of Management, Paris, 1 Rue de la Liberation, Jouy-en-Josas, 78351, France, menezes@hec.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman, Dmitry Krass<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem when customers patronize the business whenever items ordered can be delivered within certain amount of time. Such problems are often faced by internet-based retailers, such as Amazon.com. We investigate the trade-off between proximity to customers and demand fragmentation. Thus, inventory and location decisions are made, taking into account fixed location, inventory-related and opportunity costs. We present theoretical results and heuristic results.
