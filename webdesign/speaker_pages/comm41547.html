Title: Allocating Costs in Inventory Routing Problem<br>Author: Okan Ozener, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, orsan@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Ergun, Martin Savelsbergh<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider an inventory routing problem where a single product is distributed to several customers from a single facility over a finite or infinite horizon. Assuming that the historical delivery routes and the volumes delivered to each customer with these routes are known, we attempt to identify the high cost  customers. This information may be of value when allocating costs to the customers, marketing to new customers, or revisiting the routing/volume decisions.
