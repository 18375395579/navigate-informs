In the main result of the paper, we provide a new class of scheduling policies under which the long-run average total queue size scales as power 2.5 of the port number n, in a certain limiting regime of interest. This is a substantial improvement upon prior works, where the same quantity scales as power 3 of n. Our result also advances toward a conjecture about optimal queue-size scaling in input-queued switches.</br>
