Title: Sensitivity of Variational Inequalities Over Perturbed Polyhedral Convex Sets<br>Author: Shu Lu, Assistant Professor, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Dept of Statistics & Operations Research, 210 Smith Building, CB#3260, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-3260, United States, shulu@email.unc.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A variational inequality seeks a point in a given set such that the value of a given function at this point is normal to the set at this point. Sensitivity analysis studies how solutions of a variational inequality vary under perturbations of the function and the set that define the variational inequality. This talk focuses on variational inequalities over polyhedral convex sets.
