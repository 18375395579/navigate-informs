Title: An Optimization Approach for Cyclic and Non-cyclic Crew Rostering Problems in Public Transit<br>Author: Leena Suhl, Prof., University of Paderborn, Warburger Str. 100, Paderborn, 33098, Germany, suhl@upb.de<br>Coauthor(s): Lin Xie<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The crew rostering problem in public transport addresses the tasks of assigning drivers to a given set of duties with consideration of various rules. Optimal rosters are characterized by maximum satisfaction of drivers and minimal operational costs. We formulate the problem as a multi-commodity network flow problem which is very flexible and can accommodate a variety of constraints. With a minor modication, one network can formulate the cyclic and non-cyclic crew rostering problems.
