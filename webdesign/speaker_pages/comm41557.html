Title: CAPM and Risk Functions Equilibrium Models of Investment in Generation Capacities<br>Author: Yves Smeers, Professor Emiritus, Universite' catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, yves.smeers@uclouvain.be<br>Coauthor(s): Gauthier de Maere d'Aertrycke, Andreas Ehrenmann<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We reformulate the standard capacity expansion model into a stochastic equilibrium model for which we consider different extensions. Working in a CAPM/APT context we consider differentiated discount rates, stochastic discount rates and differentiated stochastic discount rates. Working with risk functions we consider incomplete markets. All models have a common property in terms of oddity of the number of solutions.
