Title: Optimal Dynamic Pricing for Parking Management<br>Author: Sean Qian, Stanford University, Department of Civil & Environmental Eng., Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, seanqian@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ram Rajagopal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The objective of this research is to maximize the benifits of parking management by optimal pricing and sensing. A generic parking model is presented for a set of sequential parking lots. We propose the system optimum and the minimum congestion parking pricing schemes. The model can be implemented in practice by utilizing parking sensors to set optimal on-line parking prices.
