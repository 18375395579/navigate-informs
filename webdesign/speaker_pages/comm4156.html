Title: Degradation-Based Prognostics via Phase-Type Approximations<br>Author: Jeffrey Kharoufeh, Associate Professor, Air Force Institute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way (AFIT/ENS), Wright Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-7765, United States, Jeffrey.Kharoufeh@afit.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a degradation-based procedure for estimating the full and residual lifetime distribution of a system experiencing degradation induced by a semi-Markov environment. The hybrid approach uses degradation measures and phase-type approximations to numerically estimate the distributions. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the procedure.
