Title: No Arbitrage Approaches for Power Contract Valuation Using Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Roy Kwon, University of Toronto, Canada, rkwon@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Gillian M. Chin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a two-phase approach for evaluating custom power contracts using stochastic programming. The first phase determines the portfolio of generating capacity and amount of a risk free asset that would replicate the claims of the contract under self-financing and no arbitrage conditions. A second phase then maximizes expected utility using bounds on capacity generated in the first phase. Numerical results are presented.
