Chin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a two-phase approach for evaluating custom power contracts using stochastic programming. The first phase determines the portfolio of generating capacity and amount of a risk free asset that would replicate the claims of the contract under self-financing and no arbitrage conditions. A second phase then maximizes expected utility using bounds on capacity generated in the first phase. Numerical results are presented.</br>
