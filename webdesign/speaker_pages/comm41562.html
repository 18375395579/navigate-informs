<br>Title: Symmetric Auctions</br><br>Author: Rahul Deb, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, rahul.deb@utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mallesh Pai</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Practical constraints often restrict auctions to being symmetric. We examine when this restriction prevents a seller from achieving his objectives. We characterize the set of incentive compatible and individually rational outcomes that can be implemented by a symmetric auction. We show that symmetric auctions can yield many discriminatory outcomes such as revenue maximization and affirmative action, and characterize the implementable outcomes when IR holds ex-post rather than in expectation.</br>
