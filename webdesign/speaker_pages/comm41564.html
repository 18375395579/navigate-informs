Autonomous surface vehicles are replacing sea vessels as a safer and more efficient option for a number of missions. A key component to their effectiveness is on-board real-time path planning algorithms that integrate the complex vessel dynamics and effects of surrounding waves.  We present the analysis and numerical results for the optimal vessel trajectories in these direction-dependent environments.</br>
