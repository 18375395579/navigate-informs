Title: Optimal Trajectories for Unmanned Surface Vehicles in Direction-dependent Wavefield<br>Author: Alvaro Maggiar, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, alvaro.maggiar@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Irina Dolinskaya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Unmanned systems have become increasingly important in a wide range of applications. Autonomous surface vehicles are replacing sea vessels as a safer and more efficient option for a number of missions. A key component to their effectiveness is on-board real-time path planning algorithms that integrate the complex vessel dynamics and effects of surrounding waves.  We present the analysis and numerical results for the optimal vessel trajectories in these direction-dependent environments.
