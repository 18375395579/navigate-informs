Title: Sequential Implementation of Tolls to Guide Flow Evolution under Bounded Rationality<br>Author: Xiaolei Guo, Assistant Professor, University of Windsor, Odette School of Business, Univ. of Windsor 401 Sunset Ave., Windsor, ON, N9B 3P4, Canada, guoxl@uwindsor.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Li<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Because boundedly rational user equilibrium (BRUE) always has a set of solutions instead of a unique one, from a static network equilibrium viewpoint, under BRUE there is no guarantee of attainability of any specific target flow by implementing tolls. In this study, from a disequilibrium flow evolution perspective, we design toll implementation sequences to guide the network flow to evolve towards any target flow under boundedly rational flow adjustment processes.
