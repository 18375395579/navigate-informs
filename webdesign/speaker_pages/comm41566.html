Title: A Phase-type Approach to Modelling Multi-skill Call Centers<br>Author: Thomas Bang Nielsen, Ph.D. Student, Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modeling, Technical University of Denmark, Richard Petersens Plads DTU, bld. 321, Lyngby, -, 2800, Denmark, tbn@imm.dtu.dk<br>Coauthor(s): Ger Koole, Bo Friis Nielsen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Routing schemes based on the waiting time of the customers in queue are common in call centers. These often take the form of thresholds at which overflow to other groups of agents is allowed. Using phase-type distributions an approximation for the waiting-time distribution in such systems is obtained.
