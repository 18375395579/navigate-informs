<br>Title: Product Design for Life Cycle Mismatch</br><br>Author: James Bradley, Associate Professor, College of William and Mary, Mason School of Business, 118C Tyler Hall, Williamsburg, VA, 23187-8795, United States, james.bradley@mason.wm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hector Guerrero</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: “Life-cycle mismatch?occurs when component life cycles are shorter than the life cycles of products that contain them.  Mitigating component obsolescence can be costly, but “durable?product designs can be more expensive to design and produce.  Our model determines the appropriate durability for a particular product life cycle.</br>
