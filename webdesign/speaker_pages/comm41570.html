Title: A Class of Nonlinear Generalized Assignment Problems<br>Author: Thomas Sharkey, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, Fl, 32611, United States of America, sharkeyt@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edwin Romeijn<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The Generalized Assignment Problem seeks an assignment of jobs to machines that minimizes the sum of the assignment costs while respecting the capacity of each machine.  We consider an extension of this problem where, along with the assignment costs, there is a nonlinear cost function associated with each machine whose argument is a linear function of the jobs assigned to that machine.  We discuss heuristic approaches to solve this class of problems and analyze their performance asymptotically.
