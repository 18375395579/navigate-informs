We present a least-cost dispatch model of the California grid to assess temporal and spatial impacts on emissions due to electric vehicle charging. Dispatch decisions depend on price, location, resource mix, and transmission capacity. Emissions assigned to vehicle charging are assigned by looking at marginal generation required at each location.</br>
