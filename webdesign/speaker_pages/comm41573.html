Title: Optimal VWAP Tracking<br>Author: Daniel Mitchell, University of Texas, McCombs School of Business, Austin, TX, United States of America, daniel.mitchell@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stathis Tompaidis, Jedrzej Bialkowski<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a strategy that tracks the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of a stock. We obtain the optimal, dynamic, VWAP tracking strategy in closed form in a model without trading costs with general price and volume dynamics. We build a model of intraday volume using the Trade and Quote data set to empirically test the strategy, both without trading costs and when trading has temporary and permanent effects.
