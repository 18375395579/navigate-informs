Title: Applying the Key Player Problem Negative to Clandestine Networks<br>Author: Travis Herbranson, Captain, U. S. Air Force, Travis.Herbranson@maxwell.af.mil<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Deckro, James W. Chrissis, Jonathan T. Hamil<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We introduce new models based on the key player problem negative that model network disruption. The mathematical programs we developed generate sets to lengthen paths, fragment networks, and create isolated components. The sets identify key nodes and arcs whose removal from the network has the potential to cause effective disruption.
