Title: Models for Sequential Grid Computing<br>Author: Saby Mitra, Associate Professor, Georgia Tech, 800 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, saby.mitra@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sam Ransbotham, Ishwar Murthy, Sri Narasimhan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a model and solution algorithm for routing a large computational job through a sequence of processors that have different peak usage times to maximize the probability of job completion within a time limit. Computational results provide insights on situations where such processing provides maximum benefits over the single processor case.
