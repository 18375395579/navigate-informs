Title: Pseudo Order Consideration in Available to Promise (ATP)<br>Author: Gilvan Souza, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, gsouza@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball, Maomao Chen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a single–period analytic model for Available–to–Promise (ATP) that incorporates n confirmed customer orders, m pseudo orders, material constraints and production capacity constraints. The decision variables are committed quantities for each order, confirmed and pseudo orders. We show that the optimal solution presents a structure similar to Littlewood's for the pseudo orders.
