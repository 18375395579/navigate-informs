<br>Title: Determining the Number of Slots to Auction</br><br>Author: David Lovell, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Department of Civil Engineering, 1173 Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, lovell@eng.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Avijit Mukherjee, Michael Ball, Andrew Churchill</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose an integer programming model to determine the number of slots to auction during different hours of the day at an airport, to maximize the net benefit to airlines from scheduling operations. Scheduling an operation during a given hour generates revenues for airlines, while delaying and canceling causes them financial loss. The net value can be determined by subtracting the cost of flight delays and cancellations from the overall revenue that is generated from scheduling operations.</br>
