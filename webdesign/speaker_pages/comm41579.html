To better capture customers' perception of service quality managers should consider the probability of long waits in each station. In a queueing network with several stations, a policy that allows idling may reduce the probability of long waits. We demonstrate the advantage of Strategical Idleness by applying Threshold Based Policies in a network with two single-server queues in tandem.</br>
