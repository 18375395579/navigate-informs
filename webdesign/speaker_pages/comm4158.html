Title: The General Machine Layout Problem<br>Author: Juan Jaramillo, West Virginia University, PO Box 6070, Morgantown, WV, 26506, United States, jrjarami@rocketmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Alan McKendall<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The general machine layout problem (GMALP) is the assignment of machines to locations while simultaneously assigning parts flows between machines, such as total system profits are maximized. The GMALP can be represented as a combination of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) and the maximum profits multicommodity flow problem (MPMFP). Since the GMALP is closely related to the QAP, it is computationally intractable.
