We introduce a canonical framework for building acyclic queuing networks to model port and overland transportation networks. Steady state equations and approximations are used to define cost and time bottlenecks. We classify how these bottlenecks shift in the network depending on parameters and decisions.  Finally, we consider how adding capacity to the network impacts efficiency.</br>
