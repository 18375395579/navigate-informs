Title: On the Diameter of Lattice Poytopes<br>Author: Alberto Del Pia, ETH Zurich, Rämistrasse 101, Zurich, 8006, Switzerland, alberto.del.pia@ifor.math.ethz.ch<br>Coauthor(s): Carla Michini<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We prove a theorem on the diameter of lattice polytopes. This result improves on previous result by Kleinschmidt and Onn, and implies a tight bound on the diameter of half-integral polytopes.
