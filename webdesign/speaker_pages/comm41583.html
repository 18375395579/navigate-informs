Title: Defender-interdictor Location Models with Uncertain Futures<br>Author: Kaiyue Zheng, IOE Department, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, zkaiyue@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Daskin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We model scenario-based two-stage p-robust defender-interdictor problems.  The defender allocates resources to mitigate the interdictor’s actions, while the interdictor wants to maximize damage while inflicting at least a minimal level of damage in each scenario.  We present two models with different interdictor options.  Algorithms and computational results are given.
