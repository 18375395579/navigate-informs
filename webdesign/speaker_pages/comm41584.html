Assume that level 1/2 fusion technology provides a set of suspicious situations currently unfolding and associated objects of interest participating in these situations. Limited resources are available to gather additional information. COA analysis and RM prescribe placement of resources to accomplish desired tasks. Problem formulated from an optimization framework, resulting in an NP-hard problem.</br>
