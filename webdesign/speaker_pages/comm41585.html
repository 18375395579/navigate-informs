Title: The Santa Claus Problem<br>Author: Nikhil Bansal, IBM Research, PO Box 218, Yorktown, NY, United States of America, nikhil@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Maxim Sviridenko<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Suppose Santa Claus has a collection of items, and wishes to distribute them to children. Child i receives values pij from item j.  If a child receives multiple items, her value is the sum of all the individual values. Santa's goal is to distribute items such that the least happy child is as happy as possible. In this talk I will describe some approximation algorithms for this problem.
