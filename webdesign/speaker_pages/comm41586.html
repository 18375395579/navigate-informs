Title: Approximate Incentive Compatibility via Fixed-point Payment Rules<br>Author: Ben Lubin, Boston University, Boston, MA, United States of America, blubin@bu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In settings where incentive compatibility is not achievable (e.g. budget-balanced combinatorial exchanges) we seek a payment rule with minimal incentive to misreport in Bayes-Nash equilibrium. We model this problem as a multi-player game that includes the center, whose strategy controls the imposed payment rule. Focusing solely on the profit available from trade, we find an approximate fixed point numerically by a variational formulation, and characterize these payment rules in several settings.
