Title: The Complexity of Nash Equilibria and Other Complementarity Problems<br>Author: Constantinos Daskalakis, Postdoc, Microsoft Corporation, costis@eecs.berkeley.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Nash's proof that every game has a Nash equilibrium relies on Brouwer's fixed point theorem and leaves open the questions: Is there a poly-time algorithm for Nash equilibrium? And is this reliance on Brouwer inherent? We resolve these questions by showing that the Nash equilibrium is a hard computational problem, as hard as any fixed point computation problem, in a precise sense motivated by simplicial algorithms for fixed points. We also present algorithms for approximate equilibria.
