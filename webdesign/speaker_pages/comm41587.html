And is this reliance on Brouwer inherent? We resolve these questions by showing that the Nash equilibrium is a hard computational problem, as hard as any fixed point computation problem, in a precise sense motivated by simplicial algorithms for fixed points. We also present algorithms for approximate equilibria.</br>
