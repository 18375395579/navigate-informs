Title: Retail Inventory Control: The Effect of Store Handling Operations<br>Author: Alina Curseu, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven/Department of Technology Management, P.O. Box 513, 5600 MB, Eindhoven, Netherlands, a.curseu@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Tom van Woensel, Jan Fransoo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a retail inventory problem and explicitly recognize the shelf-stacking at the store level as a critical operational expense. The retailer manages the inventory of multiple items facing stochastic demands and periodically reviews its stock for replenishment. Furthermore, we assume orders may be in multiples of a fixed batch size. We analyze various system operating characteristics and explore opportunities for extending existing inventory control rules with a handling component.
