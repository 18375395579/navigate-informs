<br>Title: Real-time Yard Crane Control Systems for Seaport Container Transshipment Terminals</br><br>Author: Matthew Petering, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, Industrial and Manuf. Engrg. Department, PO Box 784, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States of America, mattpete@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Goh, Robert de Souza, Yong Wu, Wenkai Li</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present several new results on real-time yard crane control at a seaport container terminal. Several control algorithms are evaluated by a fully-dynamic simulation model that considers the detailed movement of every container passing through a terminal over a several week period. The model directly connects the real-time control logic to the long-run average quay crane rate of the facility.  We also discuss rule-based versus look-ahead dispatching systems and deadlocking issues.</br>
