The objective is to maximize the profit of the chain subject to a minimum required ROI. Our model determines simultaneously the location and number of stores, the allocation of demands to the stores, and investment costs at the stores. We present managerial implications from parametric analysis. We also develop heuristic procedures and computational results are promising.</br>
