<br>Title: Optimal Rate for a Queueing System in Heavy Traffic with Superimposed On-Off Arrivals</br><br>Author: Arka Ghosh, Iowa State University, 3216 Snedecor Hall, Ames, IA, 50014, United States of America, apghosh@iastate.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a queueing control problem with a system with heavy-tailed On-Off process arrivals and constant-rate service.The control problem is to find the optimal value of the service rate which minimizes an infinite horizon discounted cost. The main result of the paper guarantees the existence of an optimal rate and specifies an explicit range of possible values of this optimal rate. We also derive and use an asymp. maximal bound on the second moment of the centered cumulative On-Off process.</br>
