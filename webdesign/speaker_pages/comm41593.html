<br>Title: Bayesian Inference for Queueing Networks</br><br>Author: Charles Sutton, University of Edinburgh, 10 Crichton St, Edinburgh, EH8 9AB, United Kingdom, Csutton@inf.ed.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael I Jordan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The performance of modern Internet services can be modeled by networks of queues. But we cannot afford detailed logging of every job in the system. Instead we assume that arrival and departure times have been recorded for a random subset of jobs, and we wish to infer the arrival and departure times of the remaining jobs. To accomplish this we introduce a Bayesian perspective on queueing networks, focusing on the distribution of the unobserved times conditioned on the recorded ones.</br>
