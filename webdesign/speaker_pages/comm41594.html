It is known that if the policy maker is allowed to recompute her policy choice after each stage(i.e. dynamic formulation), a basestock policy is optimal. In contrast, if the policy maker is not allowed to recompute her policy choice(i.e. static formulation), far less is known. We define weak and strong time consistency in this setting and provide novel conclusions.</br>
