Title: Edge Coloring and Decompositions of Weighted Graphs<br>Author: Mohit Singh, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, United States of America, mohits@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a generalization of the edge coloring problem in  bipartite graphs motivated by the study of Clos Networks. Given an edge-weighted bipartite graph G=(V,E), the task is to find a proper  weighted coloring of the edges with as few colors as possible.    We give an algorithm for the weighted bipartite edge coloring problem  which returns a proper weighted coloring using at most   2.25 n colors where n is the total weight  incident at any vertex. This is joint work with Uri Feige.
