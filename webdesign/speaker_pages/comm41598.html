Lowe</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a hub location model that solves for hub locations by minimizing hub installation costs and total flow costs subject to distance constraints. The model allows for the use of multiple coverage radii with transportation costs depending upon coverage zones. The model can be used to assist in the design of hub-and-spoke networks and in the selection of types of carriers to serve demand points from hubs.</br>
