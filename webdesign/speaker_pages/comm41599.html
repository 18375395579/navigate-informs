<br>Title: How to Distribute Antidote to Control Epidemics in a Network</br><br>Author: Amin Saberi, Professor, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, amin.saberi@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Thresholds for an infection to become an epidemic are know to exist in mathematical epidemiology. Recent work on heterogeneous networks showed that they can be prone to infection spread at arbitrarily low infection rates. As many real-world networks exhibit this behavior, we consider strategies for distributing curing resources in such networks. We show that distributing vaccine or antidote in proportion to the connectedness of an individual ensures a non-zero threshold.</br>
