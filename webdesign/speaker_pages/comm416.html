Here we present algorithms that address both equity and efficiency while planning GDPs under uncertainty in capacity. We propose an algorithm that essentially favors long-haul flights over short-hauls while assigning slots to individual flights, and show that this minimizes expected delay when there is a possibility of earlier termination time of a GDP.
