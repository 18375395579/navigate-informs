Each flight can either depart on time via a secondary route avoiding the FCA, or use the originally intended route but depart with a ground delay. The model is a stochastic program that represents the time of a possible capacity windfall as a random variable. The goal is to minimize the expected cost over the entire distribution of possible capacity increase times.</br>
