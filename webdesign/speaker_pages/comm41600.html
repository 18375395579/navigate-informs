Title: Resource Allocation in Flow-constrained Areas with Stochastic Termination Times<br>Author: Moein Ghanji, Ph.D. Student, UMD, 3429 Tulane Dr., Apt 24, Hyattsville, MD, 20783, United States of America, moein_g@yahoo.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We formulate an optimization problem for the assignment of dispositions to flights whose preferred flight plans pass through a FCA. Each flight can either depart on time via a secondary route avoiding the FCA, or use the originally intended route but depart with a ground delay. The model is a stochastic program that represents the time of a possible capacity windfall as a random variable. The goal is to minimize the expected cost over the entire distribution of possible capacity increase times.
