Title: Robust Project Scheduling at a Large IT Services Delivery Organization<br>Author: Elvin Coban, Ozyegin University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Istanbul, Turkey, elvin.coban@ozyegin.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): John Hooker, Aliza R. Heching, Alan Scheller-Wolf<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a practical project scheduling problem at a large IT services delivery organization with cross-trained employees, heterogeneous projects, schedule disruptions, and service quality guarantees. Durations of subtasks, disruptions, and project arrival times are uncertain. Our goal is to identify an effective scheduling of project subtasks and assignments to each employee. We capture uncertainties in a robust scheduling model by uncertainty sets using logic-based Benders decomposition.
