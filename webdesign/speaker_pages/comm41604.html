Title: Robust Multi-stage Screening Strategies in the Face of Strategic Applicants<br>Author: Cen Song, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, United States of America, censong@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jie Xu, Xiaowen Wang, Jun Zhuang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Security check agency could use screening policy to deter adversary but could also lose the benefit from normal application, which generates a tradeoff. This paper studies the optimal security screening policy in an imperfect and N-stage queueing system balancing security and congestion facing strategic applicants. We compare the optimal policies under discriminatory and non-discriminatory screening policies. In addition, we use robust optimization for coping with uncertainties.
