Title: Airport Runway Scheduling under Environmental Constraints<br>Author: Babak Khorrami, Metron Aviation, Inc., 131 Elden St, Herndon, VA, 20170, United States of America, khorrami@metronaviation.com<br>Coauthor(s): Terrance Thompson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Airports are large bottlenecks in the National Airspace System network. Inefficient taxiing process of aircraft on the airport’s surface can aggravate traffic delays and also increase the level of pollutants emitted by aircraft engines. An integer program presenting the time-expanded network of the airport surface is introduced with the objective of finding an optimal path for movement of each aircraft on airport surface to reduce emissions and improve traffic delays.
