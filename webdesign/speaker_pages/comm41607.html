Title: A Branching Scheme Fixing Breaks First<br>Author: Dirk Briskorn, University of Kiel, Olshausenstr. 40, Kiel, 24105, Germany, briskorn@bwl.uni-kiel.de<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider single round robin tournaments (SRRT) with minimum number of breaks. We associate cost with each possible match. Finding a minimum cost SRRT turns out to be intractable for 10 teams employing standard IP solvers. We propose an approach fixing breaks for teams before matches are arranged. Here, breaks already fixed for teams restrict the set of possible breaks for the team the next break is assigned to. We present ideas to take this into account when choosing the next break to assign.
