Title: Airport Service Availability Meets Capacity to Yield Airport Effectiveness<br>Author: Jasenka Rakas, Ph.D, University of California at Berkeley, Nextor, 107B McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, jrakas@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Borhan Oskoorouchi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This study examines the limitations posed by Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) system outages on airport effectiveness. We show how effectiveness, as a new measure of performance, can be used for terminal airspace and airport capacity estimates by considering CNS outages and airport service availabilities.  The proposed model also takes into consideration various runway configurations, traffic mix compositions and weather conditions.
