Title: Advanced Risk Measures Applied in Hazardous Materials Routing<br>Author: Iakovos Toumazis, PhD Student, University at Buffalo, 339A Bell Hall, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, iakovost@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Changhyun Kwon<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: New classes of risk measures are introduced and analyzed for local route planning in hazardous materials transportation. In particular, value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, and a general class of spectral risk measures are considered for risk-averse and flexible routing methods. Tractable computational methods are suggested.
