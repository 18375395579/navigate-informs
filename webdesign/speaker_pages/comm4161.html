Title: Optimal Arrival and Service Rate Control of Multi-server Queues with Application to Could Computing<br>Author: Nelson Lee, Department of Statistics and Operations Research, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, leent@email.unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vidyadhar Kulkarni<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal control of a multi-server queue with controllable arrival and service rates. This study is motivated by its potential application to the design and control of data centers or cloud computing facilities. The cost structure includes customer holding cost, server operating cost, and system operating reward. We derive structural properties of the optimal control policies under both discounted cost and average cost criterions.
