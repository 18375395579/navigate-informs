Title: Stability of Time-delayed Queuing Networks<br>Author: Zheng Wang, Associate Professor, School of Automation, Southeast University, 2 Si Pai Lou, Nanjing, 210096, China, wangz@seu.edu.cn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Networked manufacturing systems (NMS) should be modeled by a time-delayed queueing network (TDQN) instead of usual queueing networks, because the time-delay for material flow cannot be neglected. Stability condition of a TDQN is obtained based on the Lyapunov Theorem, for the situation of non-stationary customer arriving or dispatching processes; and a stabilization algorithm is also proposed. Based on the stability theory of TDQN, the production process of an NMS can be well controlled.
