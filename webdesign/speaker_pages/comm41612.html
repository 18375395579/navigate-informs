<br>Title: Real-time Control of Long-distance-JiT Mass Manufacturing Processes</br><br>Author: Stefan Bock, Professor, University of Wuppertal, Gauﬂstraﬂe 20, Wuppertal, 42119, Germany, sbock@winfor.de</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Automotive manufacturers tend to force their suppliers to offshore their production systems to low labor cost countries. Although this may reduce their procurement costs substantially, there is a significant increase in distance between manufacturer and supplier which creates the need for sophisticated real-time control systems at the manufacturer site.  This presentation proposes a new real-time approach that integrates the scheduling problem of the painting shop into the sequencing problem.</br>
