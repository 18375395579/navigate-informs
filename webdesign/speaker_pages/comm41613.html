Title: Incorporating the Time of Day Component in Airline Passenger Demand Models<br>Author: Joan Walker, Boston University, 675 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States, joanw@bu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: An essential element of demand modeling in the airline industry is the representation of time-of-day demand. The objective of this work is to develop airline passenger demand models that explicitly capture the time of day behavioral dimension and are appropriately sensitive to scheduling adjustments. Two key aspects of the behavior are modeled: the preferred time of day for travel for a given individual on a particular trip and the impact of these preferences on itinerary choices.
