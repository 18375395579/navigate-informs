Title: Conflicts Resolution as a Game with Priorities: Multidimensional Cardinal Payoffs<br>Author: Thomas Saaty, University Professor, University of Pittsburgh, 322 Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States, saaty@katz.pitt.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Two ways to consider increase the effectiveness of game theory in applications 1) By deriving priorities for the payoffs using a cardinal absolute instead of an ordinal or interval scale to do equilibrium analysis; 2) By considering how complex influences are interdependent in non-cooperative situations to derive priorities for best outcomes.
