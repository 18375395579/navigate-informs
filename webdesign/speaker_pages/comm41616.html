Title: Modeling and Solutions for Seasonal Transmission Switching<br>Author: Masood Jabarnejad, PhD Student, Auburn University, 333 East Magnolia Ave, Cavell Court, Unit 44, Auburn, AL, 36830, United States of America, mzj0008@auburn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jianhui Wang, Jorge Valenzuela<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Recently, optimal transmission switching is proposed for cost reduction in the power generation and dispatch. Contemporary transmission infrastructure favors the infrequent periodic switching. We propose seasonal transmission switching (STS) to meet power demands and N-1 reliability requirements throughout a season and to manage technological limitations in transmission systems, while providing cost savings. To this end, we develop a decomposition algorithm to solve the STS problem efficiently.
