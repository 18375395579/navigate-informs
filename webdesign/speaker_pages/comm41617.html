Title: On the Service Performances of Shipment Consolidation Policies<br>Author: Fatih Mutlu, Texas A&M University, Mays Business School, College Station, TX, 77843-4217, fmutlu@mays.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sila Cetinkaya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop analytical expressions of various service performance measures in order to compare the performances of alternative shipment consolidation policies. We prove that hybrid policies provide superior service compared to both quantity- and time-based policies when the probability distributions of the maximum delay times and the expected values of the average delay times for the shipment of orders are considered.
