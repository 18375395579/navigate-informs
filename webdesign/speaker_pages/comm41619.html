Title: Short-term Allocation of Shipping Contracts in Strategic Transportation Procurement Auctions<br>Author: Yassin Feki, Laval University, 2325 Rue de la Terrasse, Montreal, QC, Canada, fekihyassin@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Adnene Hajji, Monia Rekik<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a context where the strategic selection of TL carriers  uses a combinatorial auction mechanism. We address the problem of allocating shipping contracts to these strategic carriers at the operational level where the objective is to minimize not only transportation costs but also inventory and backorder costs. In this case, one should manage the tradeoff between using the strategic carriers with which the shipper already engage on at the strategic level and spot carriers.
