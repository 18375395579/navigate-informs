Title: Merging Prediction Models and Optimization for Optimal Prevention Policy<br>Author: Leila Zia, Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, leilaz@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This research merges risk prediction and cost-effectiveness analysis to optimally apply an intervention or prevention to the “right?sub-group of patients while considering the potential benefit to each patient and the cost and operating characteristics of the intervention/prevention. In particular, the cost of applying the intervention is assumed non-linear. Using a functional approximation to the ROC curve we can apply optimization methods to maximize the benefit of the intervention policy.
