Title: DADs for Protecting Critical Infrastructure<br>Author: Kevin Wood, Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, kwood@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pablo Alvarez<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A defender-attacker-defender model (DAD) prescribes optimal allocation of limited defensive resources to an infrastructure system so that a worst-case attack causes the least possible damage to system operation. We devise two decomposition algorithms for DAD, one of which computes an optimistic bound by reordering the stages of the DAD to create an “ADD.? We improve that bound by supplementing the attacker’s resources appropriately, and illustrate by protecting a road network against attack.
