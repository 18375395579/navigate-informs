Title: Restless Bandit Index Policies for Demand Response<br>Author: Josh Taylor, University of Toronto, 10 King's College Rd., Toronto, Canada, josh.taylor@utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Johanna Mathieu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Electrical loads providing demand response are often not measurable until they have been deployed. Demand response algorithms must therefore balance utilizing good loads and learning about poorly characterized but potentially good loads; this is a manifestation of the classical tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We derive restless bandit index policies to optimize this tradeoff for both when deployed loads are directly observable and when they only observable in aggregate.
