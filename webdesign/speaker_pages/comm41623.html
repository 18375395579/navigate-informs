Title: Unit Train ETA Forecasting<br>Author: Erdem Eskigun, CSX, 500 Water Str, Jacksonville, FL, 32202, United States of America, erdem_eskigun@csx.com<br>Coauthor(s): Dharma Acharya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present an ETA forecasting tool developed to better estimate the arrival time of CSX unit trains to their destinations. The tool not only considers the standard and historical transit and dwell time data but also the real time delay information to have better forecasts. The delays considered might be due to curfews, derailments, no crew, no engine, and customer shut-downs. ETA forecasts are refreshed at every real time event like arrival, departure, crew call, and delay at route stations.
