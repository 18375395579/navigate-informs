However, a particular customer reveals information about themselves with every decision, and this information, combined with the state of the system, can be used to predict the customers?remaining path and optimally allocate resources to maximize system performance. Utilizing machine learning, I investigate methods to optimize the real-time performance of a multi-tiered queueing network.</br>
