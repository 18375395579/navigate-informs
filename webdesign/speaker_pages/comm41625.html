Title: Sequential Location of Two Facilities: Where to Locate the First Facility?<br>Author: Tammy Drezner, Professor, California State University, Dept. of ISDS, Fullerton, CA, 92834, United States of America, tdrezner@fullerton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zvi Drezner<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate locating two facilities. The best strategy is to locate them optimally. When there is no efficient way to find the optimal solution to the problem, the facilities can be located sequentially. We investigate whether it is better to locate the first facility at its single facility optimal location or at a random location.
