Title: Optimizing Both Risk and Costs with Multi-objective Metaheuristics for Rich Vehicle Routing Problems<br>Author: Andreas Reinholz, University of Dortmund, Otto-Hahn-Str. 14, Dortmund, 44227, Germany, andreas.reinholz@gmx.de<br>Coauthor(s): Tycho Möncks<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Cost optimized VRP solutions are often close to the infeasible region of the search space and therefore very sensitive to the inherent uncertainty of real world applications. We present a model to quantify risk and flexibility of VRP Solutions and optimize both cost and risk with three Multi-Objective Metaheuristics.
