We study complexity and algorithmic aspects of the least core value of cooperative games with supermodular costs. We also provide motivation for studying these games by showing that a particular class of optimization problems has supermodular optimal costs.  This class includes many problems in machine scheduling, and more generally, combinatorial optimization.</br>
