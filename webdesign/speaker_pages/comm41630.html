Title: Route Design in a Fast-Bus Urban Transportation System<br>Author: Andrés L. Medaglia, Centro de Optimización y Probabilidad Aplicada (COPA) Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial Universidad de los Andes, amedagli@uniandes.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): German Riano, Juan Camilo Acero<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a mixed-integer programming model to design the set of routes for a fast-bus urban transportation system by minimizing overall passenger travel time while limiting the number of routes so that the system remains manageable and understandable.  Several solution techniques are explored taking advantage of the model’s structure.
