Title: Advanced Access and Patient Panels in Primary Care<br>Author: Sergei Savin, Associate Professor, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, svs30@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Linda Green<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We model appointment system as a queueing system in which customers about to enter service have a state-dependent probability of rejoining the queue. We derive stationary distributions of the queue size as well as identify stability conditions. We use our results to provide means to identify the maximum panel sizes for a medical practice consistent with a policy of advanced access.
