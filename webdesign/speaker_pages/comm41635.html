Title: A Semantic Model for Multi-attribute Transportation Procurement Auctions<br>Author: Hichem Klabi, LARODEC, Tunis, Tunisia, Hichem.klabi@isg.rnu.tn<br>Coauthor(s): Monia Rekik, Sehl Mellouli<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A number of studies showed the importance of considering attributes other than the price to select carriers. This talk identifies the most important attributes (through an exhaustive study of the recent litterature) and proposes a calssification of them trough a semantic model. We show the importance of considering this semantic model when solving the winner determination problem for the carriers' selection in transportation procurement auctions.
