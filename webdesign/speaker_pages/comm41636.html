<br>Title: Optimal Coordination Policies in Distributed Software Development</br><br>Author: Vijay Mookerjee, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 W. Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, vijaym@utdallas.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of designing optimal coordination policies in distributed software development (DSD). Coordination in DSD can be both within one site and across different sites. The latter type coordination involves communication across spatial boundaries (different locations) and possibly temporal boundaries (different time zones) and is the main challenge that DSD faces.  We consider both symmetric and aymmetric sites with randomness.</br>
