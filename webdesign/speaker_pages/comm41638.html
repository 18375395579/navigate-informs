Title: Job Shop Scheduling with Uncertain Job Processing Time and Limited Distribution Information<br>Author: Jinfeng Yue, Associate Professor, Middle Tennessee State University, Department of Management and Marketing, Murfreesboro, TN, 37132, United States, jyue@mtsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amy (Yu) Xia<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a job scheduling with finite set of jobs in multi-machine job shop. Assume that each job follows given chain of operations. The processing time for each job in each machine is uncertain with unknown distribution, but known limited distribution information. To minimize the total long due date penalty and lateness penalty, our procedure and heuristic process provide the robust decision of job processing sequences and due date assignment for each job under consideration.
