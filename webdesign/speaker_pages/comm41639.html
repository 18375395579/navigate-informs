<br>Title: Security Games with Limited Surveillance</br><br>Author: Bo An, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, boa@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, David Kempe, Christopher Kiekintveld, Milind Tambe, Eric Shieh, Satinder Singh</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We model the process of an attacker observing a sequence of resource allocation decisions and updating his beliefs about the defender's strategy.  We present exact and approximate computational techniques for updating the attacker's beliefs and computing optimal strategies for both the attacker and defender, given a specific number of observations.</br>
