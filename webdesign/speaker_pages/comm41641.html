The goal is to reduce both congestion and vehicle emission, assuming travelers behave selfishly. The on-and-off signal timing is replaced with a time-dependent parameter imposed on each junction. An emission model that incorporates both vehicle acceleration/deceleration and the Gaussian dispersion function is proposed. The problem of optimal signal strategy is solved as a bi-objective MPEC.
