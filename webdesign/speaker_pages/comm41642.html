Title: Optimization of Tanker Capacity under Uncertain Demand and Lost Sale<br>Author: Nikoo Sabzevar, PhD Student - Research Assistant, University of Calgary, 2500 University Dr. NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N4, Canada, nikou.sabzevar@ucalgary.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Van Enns, Janne Kettunen, Joule Bergerson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: There has been considerable growth in LNG export demand for a few decades; however, there is limited work in determining optimal tanker sizes and numbers for maritime LNG transport under uncertainty. An optimization model and a heuristic algorithm were developed to maximize expected profit under probabilistic demand with the option of lost sales. Preliminary results indicate lost sales and the optimal number of tankers increase with increased demand uncertainty.
