Title: Covering Continuous Demand in the Plane<br>Author: Zvi Drezner, Professor, California State University, Fullerton, Department of ISDS, Fullerton, CA, 92834, United States of America, zdrezner@Fullerton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Atsuo Suzuki<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Continuous demand is generated in a convex polygon. A facility located in the area covers demand within a given radius. The objective is to find the locations for p facilities that cover the maximum demand in the area. A procedure that calculates the total area covered by a set of facilities is developed. A multi start heuristic approach for solving this problem is proposed and tested by applying a gradient search.
