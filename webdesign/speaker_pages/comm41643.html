A facility located in the area covers demand within a given radius. The objective is to find the locations for p facilities that cover the maximum demand in the area. A procedure that calculates the total area covered by a set of facilities is developed. A multi start heuristic approach for solving this problem is proposed and tested by applying a gradient search.</br>
