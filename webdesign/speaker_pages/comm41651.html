<br>Title: Stochastic Control of Runway Configurations and Service Rates at JFK Airport</br><br>Author: Alexandre Jacquillat, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-234a, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, alexjacq@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper optimizes the tactical utilization of airport capacity in the face   of queue stochasticity and operating stochasticity. We minimize congestion costs   by jointly controlling runway configurations and arrival and departure service rates,   as a function of flight schedules, capacity estimates, observed congestion and operating   conditions. Stochastic queue dynamics are combined to a dynamic programming framework.   The combination of exact and approximate algorithms enables on-line implementation.   The application at JFK suggests potential congestion costs savings of 15% to 20%.</br>
