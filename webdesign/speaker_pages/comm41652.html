The goal is to determine the resource allocation capacities for serving uncertain demand that maximize the expected net-benefit based on rewards and costs associated with the different resources. We derive the optimal control policy within a singular control setting, which includes simple expressions for governing the dynamic adjustments to resource allocation capacities over time.</br>
