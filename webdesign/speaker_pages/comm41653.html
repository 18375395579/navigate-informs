Title: Monotonicity and Selection of Bidding Equilibria<br>Author: Vladimir Mares, MARES@WUSTL.EDU<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In second price common-value auctions we can identify a continuum of equilibria. This paper identifies conditions under which the set of equilibria is monotone. This allows us to construct selection criteria which identify equilibria for asymmetric cases. The criterion uniquely selects the symmetric equilibrium the symmetric case.
