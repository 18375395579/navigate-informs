Title: Sequence Optimization for Block Cave Mining<br>Author: Anita Parkinson, PhD candidate, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Anita.Parkinson@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): S. Thomas McCormick, Maurice Queyranne<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: An early step in planning a block cave mine is sequence optimization, or deciding where to mine and when. Current practice is a trial and error process. In this work we summarize the techniques used to find a sequence that maximizes the Net Present Value. When the durations of drawpoints are not constant, the problem is similar to the NP Hard problem of scheduling jobs on parallel machines. Requiring a single, contiguous cave makes the problem more challenging.
