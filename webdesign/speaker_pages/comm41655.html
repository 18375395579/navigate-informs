Title: Maximum Entropy Principle with General Deviation Measures<br>Author: Bogdan Grechuk, Ph.D Student, Stevens Institute of Technology, bgrechuk@stevens.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Zabarankin, Anton Molyboha<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A random variable maximizing Shannon differential entropy with constraints on the mean and quantile-based deviation measure has been shown to have a log-concave distribution. In the case of comonotonic deviation measure, an optimal distribution has been obtained in explicit form. Conversely, through maximum entropy principle, a log-concave distribution has been shown to correspond to a comonotonic quantile-based deviation measure.
