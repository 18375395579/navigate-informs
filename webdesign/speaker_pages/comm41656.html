Title: A Log-linear Model for Allocating Overlapping Inventory to On-line Advertisers<br>Author: John Tomlin, Principal Research Scientist, Yahoo! Research, 2821 Mission College Blvd, Santa Clara, CA, 95054, United States of America, tomlin@yahoo-inc.com<br>Coauthor(s): Deepak Agarwal, Jimmy Yang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss the allocation of inventory, defined by pools of users possessing multiple characteristics, e.g. age-range, goegraphical location, etc., to on-line advertisers who may seek some or all of these characteristics. Since the pools may overlap, some form of optimization model is called for. We consider a log-linear, i.e. maximum entropy model, and several variants with desirable properties.
