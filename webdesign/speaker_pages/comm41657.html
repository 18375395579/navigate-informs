<br>Title: Do Drivers See Time Averages?</br><br>Author: Robert Hampshire, Assistant Professor of Operations Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College, 4800 Forbes Avenue, 2102B Hamburg Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, hamp@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Many cities are deploying smart parking information systems. The goal of smart parking initiatives is to reduce the number of cruising drivers. As a rule of thumb, smart parking interventions typically set average occupancy targets for each block throughout the day. We seek to explore how drivers experience these average occupancy targets. Using data, from 1 year of observations from 17,000 sensors, we analyze how average occupancy is experienced by drivers in San Francisco.</br>
