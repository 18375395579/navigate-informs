<br>Title: Emergency Room Service Facility Location and Capacity Planning Problem</br><br>Author: Elif Akcali, Associate Professor, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States of America, akcali@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chin-I Lin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A hospital may declare divert status, when its emergency room (ER) is full or all intensive care beds are occupied. To a critical patient, this can be the difference between life and death. We present a model that simultaneously determines the number of ER service facilities to be opened as well as their respective locations and capacity levels where the probability that an ER facility declares divert status does not exceed a pre-determined level.</br>
