<br>Title: Biased Random-key Genetic Algorithm for Overlapping Correlation Clustering</br><br>Author: Carlos Andrade, University of Campinas, Av. Albert Einstein, 1251, Campinas, SP, 13083-852, Brazil, andrade@ic.unicamp.br</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mauricio Resende, Howard Karloff, Flávio Keidi Miyazawa</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In Overlapping Correlation Clustering (OCC), a number of objects are assigned to clusters. Two objects in the same cluster have correlated characteristics. As opposed to traditional clustering where objects are assigned to a single cluster, in OCC objects may be assigned to one or more clusters since an object can have characteristics correlated with objects in more than one cluster. In this talk, we present a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm for OCC. Computational experiments are presented.</br>
