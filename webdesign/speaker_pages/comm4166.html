Our method is event-based dynamic programming. Such analysis allows insights into how admission policies are sensitive to price, demand, service rates, and workforce staffing choices; it is generally applicable to systems where service is delivered in stages and advance reservations are not taken. We give a counterintuitive result, an open problem, and a conjecture.</br>
