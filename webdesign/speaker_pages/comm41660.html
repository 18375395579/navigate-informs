<br>Title: Power-log Portfolio Optimization for Maximizing Portfolio Growth and Controlling Tail Risk</br><br>Author: Arnav Sheth, Saint Mary's College of California, Moraga, CA, United States of America, aas3@stmarys-ca.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jivendra Kale</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Power-Log utility functions combine behavioral finance with multiperiod portfolio theory to represent investor preferences realistically.  In this study we test portfolio optimization with Power-Log utility functions over multiple periods with annual rebalancing using a treasury security, the S&P500 index and a call option on the index. We find that optimal Power-Log portfolios deliver higher geometric average realized returns with lower tail risk, and surprisingly lower standard deviation than mean-variance efficient portfolios that have the same ex-ante expected returns. They also provide much better downside protection against large, negative return surprises, such as the down markets in 2002 and 2008.</br>
