Title: Online Routing with Nonlinear Utility Functions: Extensions and Examples<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, 78705, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Extensions are made to an earlier online non-additive routing algorithm to account for additional dependency structures among stochastic arcs in the network. Additionally, the solution sensitivity is explored by considering different types of disutility function, representing a variety of risk preferences and functional forms.
