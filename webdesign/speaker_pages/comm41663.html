<br>Title: Online Routing with Nonlinear Utility Functions: Extensions and Examples</br><br>Author: Stephen Boyles, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, 78705, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Extensions are made to an earlier online non-additive routing algorithm to account for additional dependency structures among stochastic arcs in the network. Additionally, the solution sensitivity is explored by considering different types of disutility function, representing a variety of risk preferences and functional forms.</br>
