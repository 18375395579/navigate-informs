Title: Algorithms for Finding Bayes-Nash Equilibria in Core-selecting Auctions<br>Author: Mark Schneider, University of Connecticut, Uconn School of Business, 81 Cheney Drive, Storrs, CT, United States of America, mschneider@business.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Day<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Determining Bayes-Nash equilibria in combinatorial auctions is quite difficult, and to date, the analytical approach to finding an exact equilibrium has been successful only in very limited settings. In this work, we explore the alternative possibility of approximating equilibrium behavior using numerical methods, with a focus on the class of core-selecting auctions.
