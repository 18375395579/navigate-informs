<br>Title: Provably Near-Optimal Balancing Policies for Stochastic Inventory Control Models with Lost-Sales</br><br>Author: Retsef Levi, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, BDG E53-389, 30 Wadsworth Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, retsef@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ganesh Janakiraman, Mahesh Nagarajan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We address the single-item, single-location periodic-review stochastic inventory problem with lost-sales. Except for the case with no lead time, little is known about the structure of optimal policies and computing good policies has been a challenge even with independent demands. We show how to find dual-balancing policies whose expected cost is at most twice that of the optimal policy. The worst-case analysis is fundamentally different from models with backlogged demands.</br>
