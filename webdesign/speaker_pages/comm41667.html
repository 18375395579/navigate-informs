Title: Risk Neutrality and Ordered Vector Spaces<br>Author: Matthew Sobel, Professor, Department of Operations, Case Weatherhead School of Management, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106-7235, United States, Matthew.Sobel@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Alexander<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A result clarifies when preferences over time and risk correspond to discounting without risk neutrality. Axioms on weak ordering, continuity, non-triviality, and decomposition imply that a utility function f[u()] has f linear if and only if the converse of decomposition is valid. Since the axioms imply the existence of discount factors and the linearity of an intra-period utility function, preferences support discounting without risk neutrality only if the converse of decomposition is false.
