Title: How “Good?are Multi-agent Systems for Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems?<br>Author: F. Jordan Srour, PhD Candidate, RSM Erasmus University, Burg. Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, NL, 3011AB, Netherlands, JSrour@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Tamas Mahr, Hans Moonen, Steef van de Velde, Rob Zuidwijk<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are classically seen as a software technique espoused by social technologists, but largely disregarded by operations researchers.  Increasingly there is, however, an interest in applying MAS to a variety of real-time or dynamic settings. We compare a MAS approach to an on-line optimization approach for vehicle routing in the context of maritime container transport.
