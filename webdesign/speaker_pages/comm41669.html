Title: Preferences for Multiperiod Consumption Streams<br>Author: Casey Lichtendahl, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia, PO Box 6550, Charlottesville, VA, 22906, United States of America, lichtendahlc@darden.virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samuel Bodily<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A decision analysis often requires eliciting the form of a decision-maker’s preferences for non-negative attributes such as consumption streams.  We propose a set of simple and desirable conditions on multiattribute preferences which together narrow down the search to some attractive forms.  These forms offer a rich set of possibilities for expressing degrees of multivariate and componentwise risk aversion while retaining an essential and compelling simplicity.
