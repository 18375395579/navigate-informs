Ali Torabi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Location routing problem (LRP) is an important logistical problem that comprises two of the main logistical drivers namely facility location and vehicle routing. We focus on the planar single-facility LRP with Euclidean distance. A hierarchical heuristic-based method is put forward which continuously takes into account the information from the routing results while systematically improving the location using the end-points of the obtained routes</br>
