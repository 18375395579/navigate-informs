<br>Title: MDP Approach for Optimization in Closed Loop Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Kenichi Nakashima, Professor, Kanagawa University, 3-27-1 Rokkakubashi, Kanawawa-ku, Yokohama, 2218686, Japan, nakasima@kanagawa-u.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Arvinder Loomba</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper deals with a remanufacturing problem with stochastic variability in closed loop supply chain system. We model the system as a time average Markov Decision Process (MDP) with production/ordering quantity considerations. The cost function is assumed to be composed of cost factors such as holding, backlog, manufacturing costs etc. We obtain optimal production and ordering policy that minimizes expected average cost per period. Numerical results show implementation of the methodology.</br>
