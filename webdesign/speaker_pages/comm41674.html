<br>Title: On the Total Curvature of the Central Path for Linear Programming</br><br>Author: Yuriy Zinchenko, AdvOL, McMaster University, ITB221, 1280  Main str W, Hamilton, ON, L8S4K1, Canada, yzinchen@optserv.cas.mcmaster.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antoine Deza, Tamas Terlaky</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: By analogy with the conjecture of Hirsch, we conjecture that the order of the largest total curvature of the central path associated to a polytope is the number of inequalities defining the polytope. We prove a continuous analogue of the result of Klee-Walkup, namely, we prove that the special case where the number of inequalities is twice the dimension is equivalent to the general case. We indicate a direction for establishing a polynomial bound on the curvature.</br>
