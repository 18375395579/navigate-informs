It ensures that no passenger has more than one transfer and involves transfer hubs, trunk routes between hubs with semi-flexible vehicle re-routing, and local rerouting around hubs. A decomposed optimization is used, with detailed rules for vehicle selection and routing. Optimization and simulation frameworks are discussed, with consideration of global optimality.</br>
