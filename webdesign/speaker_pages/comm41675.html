Title: Operations and Algorithms of a Real-time Shared Ride System<br>Author: R. (Jay) Jayakrishnan, Professor, University of California, Irvine, Institute of Transportation Studies, Univ. of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697, United States of America, rjayakri@uci.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jaeyoung Jung<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: High Coverage Point-to-Point Transit (HCPPT) is an alternative design for mass passenger transport with real-time shared rides. It ensures that no passenger has more than one transfer and involves transfer hubs, trunk routes between hubs with semi-flexible vehicle re-routing, and local rerouting around hubs. A decomposed optimization is used, with detailed rules for vehicle selection and routing. Optimization and simulation frameworks are discussed, with consideration of global optimality.
