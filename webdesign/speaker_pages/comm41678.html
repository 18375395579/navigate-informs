Title: Inventory Management Under a Broad Class of Stochastic Leadtimes<br>Author: Alp Muharremoglu, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, 410 Uris Hall, New York, NY, 10027, United States, alp2101@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nan Yang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We introduce a quite general class of stochastic leadtime processes for inventory systems. This class includes models from literature (e.g. Kaplan's leadtimes with no order crossing or i.i.d. leadtimes with order crossing) and new situations, such as a model with congestion dependent leadtimes. We provide a method to compute base stock levels. The method finds the optimal levels for single stage systems and near optimal levels for multi-echelon systems.
