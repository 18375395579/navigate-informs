<br>Title: Allocating Slots for Import Containers in Container Terminal Yards with Uncertain Pick-up Sequences</br><br>Author: Pengfei Zhou, United States of America, pfzhou@yeah.net</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anne Goodchild</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: An uncertain pick-up order model is considered to reduce rehandling in container terminals, while also capturing uncertainty in truck arrival times.  A least-second reshuffle based heuristic algorithm is proposed to reduce the reshuffle ratio. The experiments reveal that the proposed method could improve the relocation performance in reasonable time.</br>
