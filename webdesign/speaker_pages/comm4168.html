In order to achieve economy of scale within the demand-driven and total cost trade-off paradigms of supply chain management, we propose the consolidation of small orders shipments into container loads to be shipped together. This is effectively obtained by inserting a decision aid system based on bin packing models into the order-release process.</br>
