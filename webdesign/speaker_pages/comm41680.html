Title: Minimum Selective Dominating Set Problem<br>Author: Je Sang Sung, Research Assistant, Texas A&M University, 302 ball street, APT G204, College Station, TX, 77840, United States of America, blackism@neo.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sergiy Butenko<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce several variations of the classical graph-theoretic concept of domination that are motivated by practical considerations. Complexity of the corresponding optimization problems is analyzed showing these variations are hard on their own respect. We also establish some basic properties of the corresponding polyhedra,  and analytical bounds on the size of structures of interest.
