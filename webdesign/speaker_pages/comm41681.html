Title: Differences in Human Server Behavior Influenced by Queue Design<br>Author: Julie Niederhoff, Syracuse University, 721 University Ave, WSOM 500, Syracuse, NY, 13244, United States of America, jniederh@syr.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kyle Harshbarger, Maria Shunko<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study examines how human servers behave in queueing systems. Analytical work in queueing theory often assumes that servers work at the same speed and accuracy regardless of the setup of the queue, but behavioral theory suggests otherwise. Various queue setups are explored in a lab experiment in order to observe differences in speed and accuracy across different treatments.
