Title: The Min-max Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problem: Three-stage Heuristic and Computational Results<br>Author: Xingyin Wang, Department of Mathematics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, wangxy@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Golden, Edward Wasil<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The min-max multi-depot vehicle routing problem is a variant of the standard multi-depot problem. The objective is to minimize the total time of the most costly route taking into account travel time and customer service time. We develop a heuristic that produces high-quality solutions that compare favorably to previous results.
