Title: On the Efficiency of Ranking Methods<br>Author: Eric Friedman, Associate Professor, ORIE Cornell, Ithaca, NY, 14850, ejf27@cornell.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We analyze the effectiveness of various ranking systems from a statistical perspective. We consider a class of random graphs in which nodes are more likely to link to higher quality nodes which are themselves more selective. We show that both pagerank and indegree are significantly suboptimal  and thus there is significant room for improvement. Of independent interest, we prove new results about the distribution of pageranks on random graphs with bounded expected degree.
