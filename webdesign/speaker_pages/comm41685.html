Redundant Klee-Minty cubes (Nematollahi et al., 2007) have  central path whose geometric curvature is exponential in the dimension of the cube. We prove an analogous result for the curvature integral introduced by Sonnevend et al. 1990. Within an algorithmic framework, we rigorously prove that the iteration-complexity upper bound for the Klee-Minty cubes is tight.</br>
