Title: Optimal Policies and Approximations for a Bayesian Linear Regression Inventory Model<br>Author: Julia Miyaoka, Assistant Professor, San Francisco State University, 1600 Holloway Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94132, United States, jmiyaoka@sfsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Katy Azoury<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the periodic review inventory problem where the demand in each period is modeled by a normal simple linear regression model. The state space includes a backward look due to the Bayesian approach and a forward look due to the regression modeling of demand. We show that a base stock policy is optimal and give some strucural results. We also propose a heuristic that provides near optimal results.
