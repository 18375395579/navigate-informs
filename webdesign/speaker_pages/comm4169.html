Title: Polyhedral Analysis of an Alldifferent System<br>Author: Dimitrios Magos, Technological Educational Institute of Athens, Ag. Spyridonos, Egaleo, 12210, Greece, dmagos@teiath.gr<br>Coauthor(s): Ioannis Mourtos<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the Integer Programming (IP) representation of a system of alldifferent predicates. We identify several classes of facet defining inequalities for such a system. Further, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for some of these classes to describe the convex hull of such a system. Given also that these inequalities can be separated in polynomial time, this condition signifies a class of alldifferent systems for which the optimization problem is polynomially solvable.
