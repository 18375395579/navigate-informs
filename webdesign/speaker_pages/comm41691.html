<br>Title: Stochastic Optimal Dispatch of Electricity Considering Transmission Line Failures</br><br>Author: Mainak Mazumdar, Professor, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15206, United States, mmazumd@engr.pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lizhi Wang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a procedure for dispatching electricity with a view to providing protection against transmission line failures. This optimal dispatch procedure has the following features: (1) Credit contingencies are determined by considering individual transmission line reliabilities and network topology. (2) Preventive and corrective actions are integrated to protect the system in both pre- and post-contingency phases. (3) It models the probability of cascading failures after a contingency occurs.</br>
