Title: Bayesian Inventory Management with Potential Change-points in Demand<br>Author: Zhe Wang, UNC Chapel Hill, CB 3490, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, zhe_wang@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Adam Mersereau<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider an adaptive inventory control problem in which at some known potential change-points, the demand process may change abruptly with some probability. The underlying demand process is never revealed to the decision maker. Using a Bayesian framework, we analyze the optimal policy as demands are observed. We construct two novel lower bounds which are used to develop two heuristics and to numerically evaluate their performance.
