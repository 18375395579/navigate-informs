Title: Information Theoretic Bounds for Distributed Computation<br>Author: Munther Dahleh, Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, dahleh@mit.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a network of nodes, each having an  initial value, and seeking to acquire an estimate  of a given function of all the nodes?values in the network. Each  node may exchange with its neighbors a finite number of bits. We present an order optimal algorithm for computation of separable functions under such  constraints in terms of the “conductance?of the graph representing this topology.
