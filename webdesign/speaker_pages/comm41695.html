Title: Responding to Unexpected Overloads in Large-Scale Service Systems<br>Author: Ohad Perry, PhD student, Columbia university, Dep. of Industrial Engineering and, Operations Research, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, op2105@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ward Whitt<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider how two large-scale service systems that operate independently can help each other when one encounters an overload, involving a jump in the arrival rate. We propose a queue-ratio control, which activates sharing of customers by the service pools when a threshold is exceeded. This control requires no knowledge of the arrival rates. Our analysis is based on a fluid model, which includes a heavy-traffic averaging principle.
