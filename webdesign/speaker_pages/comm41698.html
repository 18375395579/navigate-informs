We focus our analysis in assessing two gaps of interest: the full exploitation versus  optimal policy gap and the uncensored versus censored optimal costs. We show that, for one of the few known tractable cases, neither gap is substantial, and we characterize their structural behavior. In particularw we conclude that there is no potential gain from exploring in this problem.</br>
