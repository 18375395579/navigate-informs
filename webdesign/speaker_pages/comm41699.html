Title: A Graph Patrol Problem with Overlook<br>Author: Kyle Lin, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Rd, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, kylin@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Atkinson, Tim Chung, Kevin Glazebrook<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A patroller traverses the graph through edges to detect potential attacks at nodes. To design a patrol policy, the patroller needs to take into account not only the graph structure, but also the different attack time distributions and different overlook probabilities at different nodes. We consider both random attackers and strategic attackers, and develop index-based heuristics.
