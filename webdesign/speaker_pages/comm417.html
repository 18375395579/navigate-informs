Title: Covering Models for Sensor Placement in Water Distribution Systems under Uncertainty<br>Author: Jianhua Xu, Doctoral Candidate, Department of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, United States, mumu@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeanne VanBriesen, Michael Johnson, Paul Fischbeck, Mitchell Small<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present math programming models for location of sensors across a water distribution network. Multiple objectives include minimizing placement cost, maximizing system coverage and minimizing the population at risk, all subject to probability thresholds on detection time. The model is applied to distribution systems of varying sizes. Computational results and policy implications are reported.
