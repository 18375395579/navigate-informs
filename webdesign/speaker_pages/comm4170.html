Title: Joint Optimization of X ?Control Chart and Preventive Maintenance Policies: A Discrete-Time Markov<br>Author: Yisha Xiang, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, xiangysh@mail.sysu.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Tongdan Jin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Process control and maintenance planning have long been treated as two separate problems. The interdependence between these two activities has not been adequately addressed in the literature, despite their apparent connections. The proposed model is developed for a production process that deteriorates according to a discrete-time Markov chain. A numerical example is used to illustrate the proposed integrated process control and preventive maintenance policies.
