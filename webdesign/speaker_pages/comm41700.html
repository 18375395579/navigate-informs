Title: Robust and Sample Path Optimization of Manufacturing Systems<br>Author: Mike Veatch, Professor, Gordon College, Department of Mathematics, 255 Grapevine Rd, Wenham, MA, 01984, United States of America, mike.veatch@gordon.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider performance and optimization of manufacturing lines with machine failures and finite buffers. Mixed integer programs are used to compute makespan and sojourn times. Interarrival and service times are either simulated once (sample path optimization) or their sums are constrained in a robust optimization.
