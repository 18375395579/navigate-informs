<br>Title: The Impact of Labor Markets on Managing Operations</br><br>Author: Evan Barlow, PhD Candidate, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Rd., Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, e-barlow@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Achal Bassamboo, Gad Allon</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Firms in need of specially trained employees often have limited hiring options.  If the skills are sufficiently rare in the hiring pool, firms must either pay the expense of training employees or poach trained employees from other firms.  We analyze the effect of poaching on operational measures and training decisions in a two-firm newsvendor model.  We extend the model to explore the effects on flexible training decisions in a basic newsvendor network environment.</br>
