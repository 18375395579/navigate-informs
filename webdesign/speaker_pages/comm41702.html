Title: Addressing Adjacency Concerns while Managing Flammable Forest Landscapes<br>Author: Andres Weintraub, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile, aweintra@dii.uchile.cl<br>Coauthor(s): David Martell, Juan Jose Troncoso<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider problems where uncertain fires can disrupt the satisfaction of adjacency constraints.  One cannot harvest stands adjacent to burned stands.  Our heuristic accelerates the harvesting of high risk stands.  Application of the heuristic to a hypothetical forest increased the value of the harvest while satisfying the adjacency constraints.
