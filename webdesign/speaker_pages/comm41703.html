<br>Title: Finding Eco Routes in a Time-dependent Traffic Network</br><br>Author: Hao Lei, Phd Student, University of Utah, 110 Central Campus Dr, MCE 2000, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, hao.lei@utah.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This talk presents algorithms for estimating and finding the time-dependent eco-friendly route in a transportation network. A cross-resolution traffic model is first adapted to provide accurate traffic state and emission forecasts. A dynamic least cost path-finding algorithm with reduced search space is developed to efficiently compute route solutions with the least emissions.</br>
