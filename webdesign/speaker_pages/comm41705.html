Title: Dynamic Lot Sizing Models for Managing Retailer Inventory Using Case Packs<br>Author: Ajay Mishra, Visiting Associate Professor, SUNY Binghamton, School of Management, Binghamton, NY, 13902, United States of America, amishra@binghamton.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Often distribution centers procure case packs from vendors and then send multiples of these to individual stores. E.g., a case pack of shirts may contain a mix of small, medium, and large shirts. This saves on handling costs at the distribution center and reduces lead time. Even though products come in a variety of case packs, they sell individually and a store must order an optimal number of case packs to avoid excess units. We study replenishment decisions for a family of products at a store.
