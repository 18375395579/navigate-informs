Title: Response Time and Revenue Mangement Under Competition and Customer Choice<br>Author: Philipp Afeche, Asst. Professor, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S3E6, Canada, Philipp.Afeche@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider the problem of two providers who compete for heterogeneous  and time-sensitive customers with private information about their  preferences. How should they design price-delay menus and schedule  their resources? We characterize the price-delay equilibria and discuss how they depend on capacity levels, competition, and the value of market segmentation.
