Title: Globally Optimized Sphere Packings: Models and Illustrative Results<br>Author: Frank Kampas, Senior Developer, WAM Systems, 600 W. Germantown Pike, Suite 230, Plymouth Meeting, PA, 19462, United States, fkampas@wamsystems.com<br>Coauthor(s): Janos D. Pinter<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A general sphere packing is to find the tightest   possible arrangement of a given collection of   spheres in a given container. The container   can be e.g. a sphere, or a rectangular box.   Tightness can be measured by the volume of the   container, or by the pairwise distance between   the sphere centres, or by a linear combination of   these two objectives. We present a general   formulation of such models in Mathematica and   solve model instances using our MathOptimizer Professional software.
