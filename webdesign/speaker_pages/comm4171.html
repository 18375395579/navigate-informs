Title: Large Newsvendor Games<br>Author: Marco Scarsini, Professor, LUISS, Via O. Tommasini 1, Roma, RM, 00162, Italy, marco.scarsini@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Luigi Montrucchio<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a game, called newsvendor game, where several retailers, who face a random demand, can pool their resources and build a centralized inventory that stocks a single item on their behalf. Profits have to be allocated in a way that is advantageous to all the retailers. A game in characteristic form is obtained by assigning to each coalition its optimal expected profit.  We show that in a game with a continuum of players, under a nonatomic condition on the demand, the core is a singleton.
