Title: A Parallel Development of Nonparametric Models<br>Author: Andy Johnson, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, 237K Zachry Engineering Center, College Station, TX, 77845-3131, United States of America, ajohnson@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Timo Kuosmanen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The single output multi-input DEA model will be shown to be a constrained special case of convex nonparametric least squares.  Also, DEA will be shown to be a nonparametric generalization of parametric programming.  Through similar arguments Stochastic Nonparametric Envelopment of Data (StoNED) is also a nonparametric generalization of SFA.  A new model that generalizes COLS to the nonparametric setting called corrected convex nonparametric least squares (C2NLS) is described.
