Calls arrive randomly over time customers are impatient and may abandon the system before their service commences. The objective is to minimize staffing costs subject to some QoS constraints. We use duality theory to convert this constrained problem into an unconstrained formulation. The resulting prescription for the staffing level can be shown to be almost optimal in a suitable mathematical sense.</br>
