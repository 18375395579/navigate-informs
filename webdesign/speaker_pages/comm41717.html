Title: Adaptive Routing in Multi-Skill Call Centers<br>Author: Ger Koole, Professor, Vrije Universiteit, Department of Mathematics, De Boelelaan 1081a, 1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands, koole@few.vu.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Auke Pot<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We introduce an adaptive routing call policy for multi-skill call centers. The objective is to satisfy the service level constraints of all job types as much as possible. This policy does not need prior information on parameter values and allows even for parameter values that change over time. We give ample numerical evidence on the effectiveness of our method.
