<br>Title: APMonitor Modeling Langauge for Mixed-integer Differential Algebraic Systems</br><br>Author: John Hedengren, Assistant Professor, Brigham Young University, 350 CB, Provo, UT, 84602, United States of America, john_hedengren@byu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The APMonitor Modeling Language (APM) is an optimization platform for differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) and is coupled with large-scale solvers for data reconciliation, dynamic optimization, and nonlinear predictive control. Applications include computational biology, unmanned aerial systems, chemical process control, smart grid optimization, and oil and gas upstream monitoring systems.</br>
