<br>Title: Average-Cost Markov Decision Processes with Weakly Continuous Transition Probabilities</br><br>Author: Eugene A Feinberg, Professor, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, United States of America, eugene.feinberg@sunysb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pavlo Kasyanov, Nina Zadoianchuk</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This talk presents broad sufficient conditions for the existence of  stationary optimal policies for discounted and average-cost Markov Decision Processes with Borel state and action sets and with weakly  continuous transition probabilities. The one-step cost functions  may be unbounded, and the action sets may be noncompact. The results allow multiple applications including applications to pricing problems.</br>
