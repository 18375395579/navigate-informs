Title: Production and Transportation Integration for a Make-to-Order Manufacturing Company<br>Author: Xuying Zhao, PhD Student, University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, Richardson, TX, 75083, United States, xuying.zhao@student.utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kathryn Stecke<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: To reduce shipping costs paid to a third party logistics company, a make-to-order manufacturer can take advantage of slow shipping modes through proper scheduling. We analyze such an integration problem for different distribution scenarios. When partial delivery is allowed, a non-preemptive EDD schedule is proved to be optimal. When partial delivery is not allowed, efficient and effective heuristic algorithms with numerical experiments are given following an NP-hard complexity analysis.
