Coordinating Capacity Investments in Joint Ventures<br>Author: Guillaume Roels, Assistant Professor, UCLA, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, 90095, United States of America, guillaume.roels@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Philippe Chevalier, Ying Wei<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk we study how to structure a joint venture between manufacturing firms that pool their resources in order to reduce their overall demand risk. In particular, we study whether capacity should be owned jointly or separately so as to ensure the joint-venture's long-term viability, depending on the number of partners, the magnitude of economies of scale, and the degree of asymmetry between partners.
