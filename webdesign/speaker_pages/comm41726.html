<br>Title: Computing Pure Nash Equilibria in Action Graph Games</br><br>Author: Kevin Leyton-Brown, Assistant Professor, University of British Columbia, 2366 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada, kevinlb@cs.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Albert Xin Jiang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Action graph games (AGGs) are a compact game-theoretic representation. Finding a pure Nash equilibrium of an AGG is NP-complete, but for certain classes there exist polynomial time algorithms. We give a dynamic-programming approach that constructs equilibria from equilibria of restricted games played on subgraphs of the action graph. If the game is symmetric and the action graph has bounded treewidth and in-degree, we can determine the existence of pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time.</br>
