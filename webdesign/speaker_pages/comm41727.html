Title: Scenario Planning and Goal Programming<br>Author: Theodor Stewart, Emeritus Professor of Statistical Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa, Theodor.Stewart@uct.ac.za<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Recently, we have sought to integrate scenario planning and MCDA approaches by means of the concept of metacriteria, referring to performance measures according to different criteria within distinct scenarios.  We now seek to apply this basic approach to goal programming models, with the aim of generating policies which are satisficing in terms of both objectives and scenarios.  Practicalities of implementation both algorithmically and in terms of user judgements will be discussed.
