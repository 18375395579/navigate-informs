Title: Medical Data Classification Via Optimizing Feature Selection<br>Author: Ya-Ju Fan, PhD Student, Rutgers University, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, yjfan@eden.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Art Chaovaitwongse<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Support Feature Machine (SFM) is proposed as a new optimization method for feature selection, whose objective is to find the optimal set of features with good class separability based on the concept of intra-class and inter-class distances and the nearest neighbor rule. The empirical study shows that SFM achieves very high classification accuracies on real medical data classification. SFM’s performance is comparable to that of Support Vector Machines while using a lesser number of features.
