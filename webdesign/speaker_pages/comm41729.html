<br>Title: Markov Decision Process with Risk</br><br>Author: Toshikazu Aiyama, Professor, Tokyo Metropolitan University, 1-1 Minami-Ohsawa, Hachi-Ohji, 192-0397, Japan, tyaiyama@yahoo.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Consider an optimal policy in expected reward.  Supposed a stream of periodic reward is somewhat turbulent following the optimal policy.  An alternate policy is not optimal in expected reward sense, but produces lower variance in a stream of periodic reward.  We will evaluate the difference in both expected reward, and variance.</br>
