<br>Title: Dynamic Coordination between Two Asymmetric Agents Moving Along a Route</br><br>Author: Boaz Golany, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, golany@ie.technion.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Konstantin Kogan, Uriel G. Rothblum</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a two-agent dynamic location problem with asymmetric settings. The model can be implemented in various environments: sales, inventory control, homeland security and more. Since each agent has its individual objective function and these functions are interdependent, decisions made by one agent may affect the performance of the other agent and thus affect the overall performance of the system. We show that under a broad range of system's parameters, centralized (system-wide optimal) and non- cooperative (Nash) behavior of the agents are characterized by a similar structure. Specifically, the faster agent captures first a greater territory at its maximum speed, but then slowly retreats to some optimal location to possibly rest before getting back to the starting point in a similar way. The timing of these trajectories and the intermediate speeds are however different. Moreover, non- cooperative agents travel more and may never rest and thus the system performance deteriorates under decentralized decision- making. We show that a general (static) linear reward approach developed in Golany and Rothblum (2006) can be extended to provide coordination of the moving agents and suggest its dynamic modification.</br>
