Title: The Value of Information Accuracy in the Designated Driver Problem<br>Author: Jordan Srour, Assistant Professor, Lebanese American University, Chouran, Beirut, Lebanon, fjsrour@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Niels Agatz, Johan Oppen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine a pick-up and drop-off problem in which passengers call for rides home after a night of drinking. In such a problem, customers may pre-announce their job location, but remain uncertain about the timing. We explore the value that this inaccurate time information brings by comparing several hybrid stochastic and dynamic routing strategies.
