Title: Queuing System Topologies with Limited Flexibility<br>Author: Kuang Xu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, kuangxu@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John N. Tsitsiklis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a multi-server model where n flexible servers are connected to rn queues through a fixed connectivity graph, with average degree d. We show that as n tends to infinity, both a diminishing delay and a large capacity region are jointly achievable, even under limited flexibility (d << n): a family of random graphs are shown to stabilize all bounded admissible arrival rates, while simultaneously ensuring a diminishing queueing delay under a new class of matching-based scheduling algorithms.
