We show that as n tends to infinity, both a diminishing delay and a large capacity region are jointly achievable, even under limited flexibility (d << n): a family of random graphs are shown to stabilize all bounded admissible arrival rates, while simultaneously ensuring a diminishing queueing delay under a new class of matching-based scheduling algorithms.</br>
