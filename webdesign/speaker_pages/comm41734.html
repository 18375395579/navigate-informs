Jacobson</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The problem of assigning sequentially arriving passengers to a multilevel aviation security screening system in real-time is formulated as a discrete-time set of difference equations.  Using feedback linearization, an optimal state feedback control algorithm is developed to achieve desired security class occupancies while maximizing a total system security measure.</br>
