Title: On the Link Travel Time Imputation Methods<br>Author: Lei Zhu, Graduate Research Assisant, University of Arizona, 1209 E 2nd street, RM 324J, Tucson, AZ, 85721, leizhu@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chang Chiu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Link travel time imputation is important for shortest path algorithms under a certain circumstance. Based on traffic flow conservation law and the average flow theorem, the missing travel time can be estimated by flow of adjacent upstream and downstream road segments. In this research, the missing link travel times are categorized into several conditions and the proposed imputation methods have been shown to deal with each condition effectively.
