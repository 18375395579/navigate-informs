This paper examines how flight delays can be reduced while minimizing the impacts on airlines?networks of flights and passengers?itineraries. The approach combines stochastic queue dynamics, capacity estimation at the operational level and an Integer Programming scheduling model at the strategic level. It shows that delays can be significantly reduced with limited interference with existing schedules.</br>
