Title: The Supply Chain Impact of Environmental Labeling Design<br>Author: Chonnikarn Fern Jira, Doctoral Candidate, Harvard Business School, Wyss House, Soldiers Field Road, Boston, United States of America, cjira@hbs.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We explore two designs of environmental labels: one where a fixed level of environmental performance is chosen by the retailer and the other where the supplier chooses his environmental performance, which the retailer communicates to consumers. We analyze the optimal levels of environmental performance in these two models under deterministic and stochastic demand. We show that while the two models are equivalent under deterministic demand, they can differ under stochastic demand.
