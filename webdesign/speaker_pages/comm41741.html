<br>Title: A Model of Facility Hardening in the Presence of Disruptions</br><br>Author: Michael Lim, Northwestern University, Department of IE/MS, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, m-lim2@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Daskin, Sunil Chopra, Achal Bassamboo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We formulate a location problem incorporating facility hardening in the presence of random disruptions.  We show the presence of two regimes:  one using only hardened facilities and one using hardened and non-hardened sites.  We examine the impact of misestimating the failure probability and derive managerial policies to mitigate facility disruptions.</br>
