Title: A Modified Fluid Delay Model for the Optimal Design of a Dynamic Call Center<br>Author: William Massey, Professor, Princeton University, ORFE Department, Princeton, NJ, United States, wmassey@Princeton.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Hampshire, Otis Jennings<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A call center queueing model is analyzed using dynamic optimization to estimate a profit optimal staffing and provisioning schedule consisting of three optimal operation modes.  Combining this with the modified offered load approximation for dynamical loss systems, we can estimate the blocking and abandonment probabilities plus the profit for the original call center delay model.
