Planning stock levels and allocating inventory properly is of paramount importance to the timely and cost effective completion of these overhauls. We present DP formulations of these planning and allocation problems, and apply ADP methods to solve them. Computational results show the advantage of using a dynamic stocking policy as opposed to myopic first-come-first-serve overhaul strategies.</br>
