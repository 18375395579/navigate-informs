Title: Railway Network Train Pathing by Timed or Physical Block Headway<br>Author: Steven Harrod, Assistant Professor, University of Dayton, 1143 Ashburton Dr., Dayton, OH, 45459, United States of America, a2soft@aol.com<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Schlechte<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Two commonly used modeling methods for railway train path scheduling or timetabling are applied to identical problem sets and compared on performance measures such as solution time, value of solution, and accuracy of solution. The objective is to maximize the utility of the network, measured in train count and adherence to preferred timings. The model formulations are differentiated by whether they enforce timed separation of trains or physical separation of trains.
