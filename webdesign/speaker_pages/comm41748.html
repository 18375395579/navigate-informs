Title: The Effect of the Boundary Conditions on the Operating Characteristics of a Service Delivery Test<br>Author: Yefim Michlin, Technion ?Israel Institute of Technology, Technion, Faculty IE&M, Haifa, 32000, Israel, yefim@technion.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Genady Grabarnik, Larisa Shwartz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A test is designed to assess the mean service time spent by a server on a maintenance request by a client. We refer to the server as a member of a group of relatively homogeneous system administrators in a large service center. This article analyzes the impact of non-stationarity of the service process at the beginning and end of the day on the operational characteristic of the test. The recommendations on the optimal ratio of the service group size and duration of the test are suggested.
