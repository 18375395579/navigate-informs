We constructed the supply chain for biofuel starting from farms and to the blending facilities where the biofuel is blended with the regular fuel. In our model we assumed that demand and supply are known and deterministic. Our objective is to determine the location of the collection facilities and biorefineries to be opened and also to determine the production, inventory and logistic (transportation) decisions.</br>
