Title: Interactive Evolutionary Multicriteria Scheduling<br>Author: Jon Marquis, Arizona State University, Dept of Industrial Engineering, Tempe, 85287-5906, United States, Jon.Marquis@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Esma Gel, Pekka Korhonen, John Fowler, Murat Koksalan, Jyrki Wallenius<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe an interactive genetic algorithm that develops solutions to multicriteria scheduling problems. Our algorithm assumes only that there exists a quasi-concave preference function of the scheduling criteria, and elicits decision maker preference information to partial order the population. We will present information about solution quality for the weighted completion time and total tardiness criteria.
