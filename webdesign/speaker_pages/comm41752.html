Title: Fuel Management for Wildfire Hazard Reduction with Spatial and Temporal Ecological Requirements<br>Author: James Minas, RMIT University, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, 3001, Australia, james.minas@rmit.edu.au<br>Coauthor(s): John Hearne<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a mixed integer programming model for multi-period fuel treatment scheduling that generates fire resistant spatial fuel patterns. Our model incorporates ecological requirements such as: minimum and maximum treatment intervals, requisite habitat growth stage proportions, and spatial contiguity and compactness of habitat.
