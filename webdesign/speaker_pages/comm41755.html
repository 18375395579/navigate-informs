<br>Title: The Dynamic Air Cargo Loading Problem</br><br>Author: Joseph Hartman, University of Florida, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Gainesville, FL, United States, jch6@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Storer</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Cargo containers of the same size but varying weights arrive to an airplane according to a stochastic process over time.  A tradeoff must be made as to whether containers should be loaded upon arrrival, ensuring an on-time or early departure, or held in order to achieve a better balance, improving the operation of the airplane.  We report on a number of scenarios defined by high and low variance of arriving weights.</br>
