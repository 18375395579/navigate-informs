Title: Assessing Transportation Network Vulnerability Considering Driver Re-routing<br>Author: Pam Murray-Tuite, Assistant Professor, Virginia Tech, 7054 Haycock Road, Falls Church, VA, 22043, United States of America, murraytu@vt.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Transportation network vulnerability assessments must consider more than the network topology.  The drivers are independent entities who exert independent control over their decisions to travel if at all and the route, which may change once begun.  A mathematical program is presented to identify links to which the network is most vulnerable considering driver decisions.
