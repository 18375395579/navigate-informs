Title: Joint Condition Based Maintenance and Spare Part Inventory Control for a Single Manufacturing System<br>Author: Haitao Liao, Assistant Professor, Department of Nuclear Engineering/Department of Industrial and Information Engineering, University of Tennessee, 211 Pasqua Engineering Building, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States of America, hliao4@utk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mitchell Rausch<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The problem of integrating condition based maintenance and spare parts inventory control for a single manufacturing system is studied. Based on the underlying degradation process, a preliminary stockout probability optimization model is formulated to initialize the number of spare parts. Condition based maintenance and spare parts management are then tied together into an overall production decision model to generate an optimal static preventive maintenance policy.
