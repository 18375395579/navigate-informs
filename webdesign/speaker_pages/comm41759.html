<br>Title: Stochastic Modeling Approaches to Influence Maximization in Social Networks</br><br>Author: Mohammadreza Samadi, Graduate Research Assistant, University at Buffalo, the State University of New York, University SUNY, 327 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, msamadi@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Nikolaev, Rakesh Nagi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion model based on the idea of exponentially distributed lag between until product or opinion adoption. Memorylessness property of the exponential distribution allows for handling the dependence between the lag rate and the state vectors of potential adopters in a social network.</br>
