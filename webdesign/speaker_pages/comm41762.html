Title: Evaluation of Coordinate Sensor System Reliability Using Monte Carlo Methods<br>Author: Qingyu Yang, University of Iowa, Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, qiyang@engineering.uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yong Chen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The diagnosability information of coordinate sensor systems in multistage manufacturing processes has a matroid structure when sensors in the system fail catastrophically. Evaluating the reliability of coordinate sensor systems is therefore an NP hard problem, which has not been investigated in the literature. In this paper, Monte Carlo methods are applied to evaluate/approximate the coordinate sensor system reliability and their performances are compared.
