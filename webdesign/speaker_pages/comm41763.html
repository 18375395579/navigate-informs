In many cases, the analysis is motivated by the need to decide on a transportation investment, regulation, or policy, to achieve system objectives desired by public authorities.  These analyses are normative, not descriptive.  We present an inverse variational inequality formulation and solution method based on a proximal point algorithm (PPA) for a class of network flow control problems.</br>
