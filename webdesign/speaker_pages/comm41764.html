There are two ways  to reduce the walking distance: The use of technology - convey or systems and/or the ability to transmit order information via mobile device.  And through design - where best to locate depots (where workers receive pick lists and deposit completed orders) and how best to lay out the product.  We build a stochastic model to determine how to minimize walk time for various configurations.</br>
