Title: The p-median with Construction Costs<br>Author: Vladimir Marianov, Professor, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Department of Electrical Engineering, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Sa, Chile, marianov@ing.puc.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Gabriel Gutierrez-Jarpa, Carlos Obreque, Oscar Cornejo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A known number of facilities are located in a rural zone.

We formulate the problem using a multicommodity flow formulation and propose a Lagrangean-based solution procedure. Computational experience is provided.
