Title: Dynamic Load Balancing in Parallel Networks with Heavy-Tailed Service Distributions<br>Author: Luz Caudillo, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan IOE, 1205 Beal Avenue, Industrial and Operations Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States, fuentesl@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Lewis, David Kaufman<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider dynamic load balancing for parallel processing networks (PPNs) with service times that follow a heavy-tailed distribution. With non-exponential services, the control problem is intractable. As an approximation, we consider a two station, two class exponential model with usual and slow customers. This amounts to a hyper-exponential approximation of the service times. Structural results for the exponential model are used to develop a heuristic for the original model.
