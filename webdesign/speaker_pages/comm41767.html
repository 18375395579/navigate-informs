Title: Tank Car Safety Design vs. Infrastructure Improvements in Reducing Hazardous Materials Transportation Risk<br>Author: Mohd. Rapik Saat, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N.

A cost-benefit model is being developed that compares tank car replacement to railroad accident rate reduction to determine the conditions when one is more effective than the other.
