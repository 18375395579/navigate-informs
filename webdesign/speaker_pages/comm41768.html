We focus on a setting where manufactured and remanufactured items are perfectly substitutable; manufacturing, remanufacturing, and disposal activities are capacitated; and manufacturing capacity is shared among multiple product types. We develop decomposition-based solution approaches, and present computational results illustrating the efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.</br>
