Title: Reducing No-notice Evacuation Time by Relocating Family Dependents to More Assessable Sites<br>Author: Sirui Liu, Virginia Tech, 7054 Haycock Road, Falls Church, VA, United States of America, lius77@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pam Murray-Tuite<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Under no-notice disasters, dependents in facilities such as schools and daycare centers usually wait for their families to pick them up. This pattern increases individual evacuation time and might cause extra delay for other vehicles, and therefore increases total evacuation time. This study focuses on reducing total evacuation time by relocating dependents to more accessible sites.  A mathematical program to select the optimal sites is presented.
