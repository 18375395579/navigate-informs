The goal is to find a set of vehicle tours over the entire motorway network. They are planned according to spatial and temporal traffic distributions. In addition, a duty roster plan is generated for each crew member that is assigned to the tours. We will show that many practical requirements can be modeled. Computational results demonstrate that real-world instances can be solved.</br>
