Title: Solving Multi-trip Vehicle Routing under Order Incompatibilities ? A RVRP Arising in SCM<br>Author: Ulrich Derigs, Professor, University of Cologne, Albertus Magnus Platz, Koeln, Germany, ulrich.derigs@uni-koeln.de<br>Coauthor(s): Markus Pullmann<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We introduce a new VRP class which is motivated by a specific 2-echelon distribution system where products come to the depot from different factories by semi-trailers and the trailers are also used for short-haul distribution with other trucks, i.e. the load from different factories is not consolidated at the depots. We model the problem as a set partitioning problem and show that concurrent LS/LNS- neighborhood search is effective and efficient.
