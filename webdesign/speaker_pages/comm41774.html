Title: Airline Flight Schedule Optimization<br>Author: Ahmed Abdelghany, Associate Professor, Embry-Riddle, Daytona Beach, FL, 32114, United States of America, abdel776@erau.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Khaled Abdelghany<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present an optimization model for airline schedule planning. Given the flight frequency in every city-pair, the model determines the optimal departure time for each proposed flight. The model considers the trade-off among maximizing the airline's market share, establishing efficient aircraft rotations, and minimizing aircraft ground time.
