The models consider both route and departure time choices and rely on a time-expanded network.  Because time is discretized, it is possible that no flow distribution satisfies the traditional user equilibrium conditions.  When this occurs, we assume that users switch to a least-cost route only if doing so reduces their costs by a sufficiently large amount.
