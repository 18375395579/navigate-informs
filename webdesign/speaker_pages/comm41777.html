Title: Fluid Limits of  GI/GI/N Queueing Systems with Many Servers<br>Author: Haya Kaspi, Professor, William Davidson Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion, Haifa, 32000, Israel, iehaya@techunix.technion.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Kavita Ramanan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The talk focuses on a fluid limit of a GI/GI/N queueing system when the number of servers coverges to infinity. To describe the evolution of the system we use a measure valued process that keeps track of the time in the service of the various customers in service, and in addition a variable that describes the total number of customers in the system.  We show that the limiting pair satisfies an evolution equation and discuss some of its properties.    This is joint work with Kavita Ramanan.
