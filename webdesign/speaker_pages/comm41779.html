Jeong, Mary Leitnaker<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper extends the adaptive thresholding to the versions of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) control for process monitoring based on functional data. Simulation studies show that proposed methods quickly detect smaller local and vertical shifts.
