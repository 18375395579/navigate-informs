Title: A Problem to Sequentially Screen Passengers for Aviation Security<br>Author: Laura McLay, Assistant Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, Statistics & Operations Research, 1001 W Main Street, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States, lamclay@vcu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sheldon H. Jacobson, John Kobza, Adrian Lee<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Passenger screening systems have become an important component in the design and operation of aviation security systems. This presentation introduces the Sequential Stochastic Multilevel Passenger Screening Problem (SSMPSP), which allows passengers to be optimally assigned (in real-time) to aviation security resources. SSMPSP is formulated as a Markov Decision Process, and an optimal policy is found using dynamic programming.  The model is illustrated with computational results.
