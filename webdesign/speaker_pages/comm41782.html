Title: Probability Elicitation, Scoring Rules, and Cooperation Among Forecasters<br>Author: Casey Lichtendahl, Assistant Professor of Business Administration, University of Virginia, Darden School of Business, P.O. Box 6550, Charlottesville, VA, 22906, United States, lichtendahlc@darden.virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert L. Winkler<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop the notion of a joint scoring rule (a collection of interdependent scoring rules) and show that proper joint scoring rules can be generated on a project-by-project basis when eliciting probabilities from independent forecasters.  These rules mimic the cooperative stakes business shares would naturally induce.  We discuss the extent to which dependent forecasters deviate from the truth under slightly revised stakes.
