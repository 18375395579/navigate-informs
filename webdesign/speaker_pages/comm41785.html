Title: Shared Transportation Systems: The Role of Stockouts<br>Author: Ashish Kabra, INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France, ashish.kabra@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karan Girotra, Francis de Véricourt<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Shared urban transportation systems have the potential to reduce urban pollution, relieve traffic congestion and increase economic activity in cities, while offering the convenience of personally owned vehicles. While the conveniences of the systems are manifold, the systems expose consumers to the risk of stockouts. We analyze data on stockouts from different operational systems and identify its impact and superior facility locations that might limit stockouts.
