Title: Optimality Proof of the Kise-Ibaraki-mine Algorithm<br>Author: Zhi-Long Chen, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, R.H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, zchen@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shan-Lin Li, Guo-Chun Tang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Kise, Ibaraki and Mine [Operations Research, 26 (1978), 121-126] give an O(n^2) time algorithm  to find an optimal schedule for the single-machine number of late jobs problem  with agreeable job release dates and due dates. We point out that their proof of optimality for their algorithm is incorrect by a counter-example, and give a correct proof of optimality.
