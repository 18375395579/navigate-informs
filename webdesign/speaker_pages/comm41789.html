To maintain coverage when demand fluctuates, EMS operators are practicing dynamic redeployment strategies by relocating the fleet during the day.  The more busy an ambulance is the greater the chance of crew fatigue and increasing attrition.  We formulate a probabilistic model to minimize the workload differences within the fleet while maintaining coverage requirements.</br>
