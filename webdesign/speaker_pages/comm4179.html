Title: Near-optimal Transportation and Fair Cost Allocation in an Agricultural Supply Chain with Perishable Products<br>Author: Christine Nguyen, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, nguyen7@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alejandro Toriello, Maged Dessouky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider an agricultural supply chain where several suppliers consolidate transportation of a perishable product to achieve economies of scale. Using industry data from California flower growers, we compare a practical greedy one-step lookahead policy against optimal solutions computed from a dynamic program, and determine whether transportation costs can be allocated fairly among the suppliers.
