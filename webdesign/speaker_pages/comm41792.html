This paper develops strategies to: (i) assign classes to servers, (ii) determine when each of servers would be powered on and off, (iii) set the processing speed of each server and (iv) route requests from dispatcher to servers. The objective is to achieve time-stable performance while maintaining high performance and cost-effectiveness with time-varying arrivals.</br>
