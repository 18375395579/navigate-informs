<br>Title: Sharp Bound For Probabilities In A Distribution With Given Shape Information</br><br>Author: Ersoy Subasi, RUTCOR, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, esub@rutcor.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mine Subasi, András Prékopa</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The binomial moment problem with finite, preassigned supports and given shapes of the distribution is formulated and used to obtain sharp lower and upper bounds for probabilities that exactly r out of n events occurs as well as probabilities that at least r out of n events occurs. The bounds are based on the knowledge of some of the binomial moments of the number of events which occur. Numerical examples and applications in reliability and finance are presented.</br>
