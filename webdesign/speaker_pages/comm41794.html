Andrade</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Network migration occurs when inter-nodal traffic from an outdated  network is migrated to a new network.  When a node is migrated, one  or more temporary arcs may need to be set up since the node migrated  may be adjacent to more than one still active node in the old network.  One seeks an ordering of the migration of the nodes that minimizes the  maximum sum of capacities of the temporary arcs.  We propose a hybrid  heuristic which combines GRASP with path-relinking for this problem.</br>
