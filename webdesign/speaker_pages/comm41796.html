Title: Routing with Queuing<br>Author: Bertil Liden, SkogForsk, Uppsala, Sweden, bertil.liden@skogforsk.se<br>Coauthor(s): Patrik Flisberg, Mikael Ronnqvist<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Routing of trucks is often done with the assumption that routes are independent. This can often lead to extensive queuing at larger mills and it is important to consider this aspect. We propose a solution method which adds on queuing as an important constraint. We present results from case studies in Sweden.
