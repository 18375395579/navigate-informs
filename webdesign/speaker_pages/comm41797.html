Title: Analysis of Tradable Mobility Credits under Uncertainty<br>Author: Nima Shirmohammadi, PhD student, University of Florida, 518C, weil hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6580, United States of America, nimashir@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Congestion pricing and tradable credits schemes achieve the same level of efficiency in an idealized environment of perfect certainty. However, these two instruments behave differently under uncertainty. This study analyzes and compares the performance of tradable credits and congestion pricing in controlling total vehicle miles travelled in a general network with uncertain demand and degradable capacity, and provides insights on how to design tradable credits schemes against uncertainty.
