Title: Density Expansion of the SABR Model: A Probabilistic Perspective<br>Author: Nan Chen, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Nian Yang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The SABR stochastic volatility model, introduced by Hagan et al. (2002), yields a good fitting to implied volatility smile curves and captures the correct co-movements between the volatility  and the underlying level. In this paper we investigate an innovative probabilistic approach to obtain an almost exact marginal transition density for the underlying price and volatility processes with the help of the time-changed Bessel processes and the Watanabe-Yoshida asymptotic expansion theory.
