Title: Rare Event Simulation for Processes Generated via Stochastic Fixed Point Equations<br>Author: Jeffrey Collamore, Associate Professor, University of Copenhagen, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Universitetsparken 5, Copenhagen, DK-2100, Denmark, collamore@math.ku.dk<br>Coauthor(s): Anand Vidyashankar, Guoqing Diao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Stochastic fixed point equations (SFPEs) arise in a wide variety of applications in, e.g., insurance, finance, and the analysis of algorithms.  A general SFPE has the form V =_d f(V) (=_d denotes equality in distribution), where the objective is very often to infer the tail probabilities of V. We present a general importance sampling algorithm for computing these rare event probabilities, establishing efficiency, optimality, and sharp estimates for the running time.
