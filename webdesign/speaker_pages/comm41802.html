Title: Dynamic Scheduling of Operating Reserves in Electricity Markets with Wind Power<br>Author: Zhi Zhou, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 South Cass Ave., Argonne, IL, 60439, United States of America, zzhou@anl.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Audun Botterud<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic methodology to estimate a demand curve for operating reserves representing the amount that a system operator is willing to pay for these services. The demand curve is quantified by the cost of unserved energy and the expected loss of load, accounting for uncertainty from generator contingencies, load and wind power forecasting errors. The methodology addresses two key challenges in market design: more efficient wind power integration and improved scarcity pricing.
