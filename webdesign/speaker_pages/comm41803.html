Title: Invariance Relations for N-switch Utility Functions with Multiple Attributes<br>Author: Ali Abbas, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Industrial and Ent. Systems Engineering, 104 S. Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, aliabbas@uiuc.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We extend Pfanzagl’s invariance principle to multiple attributes. We discuss invariance on all attributes; a proper subset; and invariance with identical shift parameters. We show that any continuous and monotonic MAU with mutual utility independence is an invariant utility function to a multivariate transformation. We discuss the functional equations whose solutions yield n-switch multiattribute utility functions between multivariate lotteries when modified by monotonic transformations.
