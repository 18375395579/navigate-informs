Title: Chasing Demand: Pricing and Learning in a Changing Environment<br>Author: Bora Keskin, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America, bora.keskin@chicagobooth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Assaf Zeevi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a dynamic pricing problem in which a seller faces an unknown demand model that can change over time. We measure the amount of change over the time horizon using a suitable metric, and allow a finite budget for such changes. We first derive a lower bound on the expected performance gap between any pricing policy and a clairvoyant who knows the temporal evolution of the underlying demand model up front. Then, we design a pricing policy that (asymptotically) matches said lower bound.
