Title: Bayesian Active Learning for Finding Maximally-valued Exemplars<br>Author: Peter Frazier, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, School of ORIE, Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, pf98@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jialei Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a Bayesian optimal search problem, related to active learning and arising in an application to materials science.  In active learning, we have training data with unknown binary labels.  Obtaining labels is expensive, and we wish to obtain a small number of labels, so that the statistical classifier built from them is good.  We consider a variant in which each datapoint has an associated known value, and our goal is to find a datapoint with a positive label and large value.
