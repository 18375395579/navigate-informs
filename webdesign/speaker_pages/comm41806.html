Title: Critical Node Detection in Sparse Graphs<br>Author: Ashwin Arulselvan, University of Florida, 1111 SW 16th Avenue, #106, Gainesville, FL, 32601, United States, ashwin@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Clayton Commander, Panos Pardalos, Lily Elefteriadou<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In the critical node detection problem, we seek a set of nodes in a graph with a specific cardinality whose deletion results in maximum disconnectivity. The problem has applications in several fields including biomedicine, telecommunications, and military strategic planning.
