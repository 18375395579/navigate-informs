We characterize the firm’s optimal policy about when and by how much to adjust the capacity in a multi-period model. We also propose simple data-driven heuristics, show the asymptotic convergence, and characterize the convergence rate. We finally illustrate the benefit of demand learning using data of Ford Focus.</br>
