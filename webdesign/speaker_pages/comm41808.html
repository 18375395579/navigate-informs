Neither airline has perfect probabilistic characterization of demand; only range of demand in each fare class is known. Each airline is interested in deriving policies with worst-case guarantees. We provide a game-theoretic analysis of the problem assuming nested booking limits are used by each airline. We provide sufficient conditions for unique Nash equilibrium to exist. Properties of the optimal policies are also discussed.</br>
