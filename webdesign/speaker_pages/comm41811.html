We investigate how runway configurations, crossings, and taxi distance factor into the decision to perform a single engine taxi. From the statistical analysis utilizing actual airline fuel consumption data we find enablers of single engine taxi to be a relatively long taxi distance, full information about taxiway congestion, and runways dedicated to departures.</br>
