While this amounts to a continuous location problem by nature, various discretizations are generally relied upon to solve such problems. The result is potential for representation errors that negatively impact analysis and decision making. This paper develops a solution approach for the continuous arc covering problem that theoretically eliminates representation errors.</br>
