Title: A Bounding based Solution Approach for the Continuous Arc Covering Problem<br>Author: Ran Wei, Arizona State University, P.O.Box 875302, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, rwei5@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Murray<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Siting facilities to serve continuous arc demand is common in many planning contexts. While this amounts to a continuous location problem by nature, various discretizations are generally relied upon to solve such problems. The result is potential for representation errors that negatively impact analysis and decision making. This paper develops a solution approach for the continuous arc covering problem that theoretically eliminates representation errors.
