Title: Finite First Moment Conditions for the Workload Components in FIFO Multiserver Queues<br>Author: Alan Scheller-Wolf, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, awolf@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rein Vesilo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We derive first moment results for all the components of the stationary workload vector in stable FIFO GI/GI/k queues (previous work has dealt only with the smallest component, delay).  Our conditions incorporate the interaction between service time distribution, traffic intensity and the number of servers in the queue.  Sufficient conditions for finite mean of the i’th smallest component of the workload vector depend on the relationship between the load and the actual index of the component.
