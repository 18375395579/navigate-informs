<br>Title: Indicator Functions and the Algebra of the Linear-quadratic Parametrization</br><br>Author: Arman Sabbaghi, Harvard University Department of Statistics, 1 Oxford Street, 7th Floor, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, sabbaghi@fas.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): C.F. Jeff Wu, Tirthankar Dasgupta</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Indicator functions are constructed under the linear-quadratic parametrization of contrasts, and applied to study partial aliasing for three-level fractional factorials. Algebraic operations are introduced to simplify calculation of indicator coefficients. These operations connect design constructions to analyses under the linear-quadratic system, and establish conditions for estimable interactions.</br>
