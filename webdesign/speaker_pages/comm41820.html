Title: Inventory Control When the Lead-time Changes<br>Author: Sven Axsater, Lund University, P. O. Box 118, SE-22100 LUND,Sweden, Lund, Sweden, sven.axsater@iml.lth.se<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A single-echelon inventory system with continuous review and Poisson demand is considered. There are linear holding and backorder costs. We study a change in the lead-time, which is typical in connection with a Just-In-Time philosophy. Our main focus is a lead-time decrease. Due to the lead-time change, the optimal steady state solution will, in general, change. We consider the transient problem of bringing the system from its original steady state to the new steady state in an optimal way.
