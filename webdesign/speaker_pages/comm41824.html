Title: A Power System Planning Model with Intermittent Wind Resources<br>Author: Richard Chen, University of Michigan, Industrial and Operations Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, richchen@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Duncan Callaway, Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a long term capacity planning model with wind resources. The model considers wind intermittency, uncertainty in demand and the trade-offs between system reliability and transmission costs (infrastructure and loss). The proposed model determines how, when and where to build a network of interconnected wind farms.
