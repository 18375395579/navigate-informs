<br>Title: Inventory Policies for Capacitated Systems with Multiple Products.</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mahesh Nagarajan, Ganesh Janakiraman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a production-inventory model in which multiple products are produced using a common production resource with finite capacity. The system is reviewed periodically and the demands for the products are random. Costs are linear and excess demand is backordered. We examine optimal and near-optimal policies (ordering & allocation policies) for long run average cost performance measure.</br>
