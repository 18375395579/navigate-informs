<br>Title: Optimal Multiple Stopping and Switching: An Eigenfunction Expansion Approach</br><br>Author: Lingfei Li, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 608 MMW Engineering Building, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong - PRC, lfli@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop an eigenfunction expansion based approach to solve finite horizon discrete time optimal multiple stopping and switching problems for a rich class of Markov processes. To illustrate the method we consider two applications: pricing chooser flexible cap (floor) under popular short rate models and valuation of combination cargo carriers in the shipping industry.</br>
