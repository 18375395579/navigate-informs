Title: Generalized Convex Equitable Partitions and Applications<br>Author: John Carlsson, Stanford University, 238 Ayrshire Farm Ct, apt 101, Stanford, CA, United States of America, johngcarlsson@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We have previously developed an algorithm for finding a convex partition that divides a convex polygon into n convex pieces, each having equal area and containing one element of a given point set. The initial motivation for this problem is a vehicle routing heuristic. In a related problem (also motivated by vehicle routing), we require each piece to contain a fixed amount of points and an equal fraction of the area of a polygon. We describe an algorithm that solves this problem polynomially.
