The scheduler can use machine time to test jobs and gain better information on the respective lengths. This captures a common practical tradeoff of allocating resources between diagnostic that improves information and allows better scheduling, and doing work. We use a new cost-accounting scheme to characterize properties of optimal policies and devise a surprisingly low dimensional DP formulation and FPTAS.
