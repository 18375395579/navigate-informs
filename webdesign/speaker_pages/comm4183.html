Title: A DSS for Workforce Scheduling at an Emergency Services Call Center<br>Author: Gerald Evans, Professor, University of Louisville, Department of Industrial Engineering, Louisville, KY, 40292, United States of America, gwevan01@louisville.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This presentation describes a simulation-based tool for workforce scheduling at an emergency services calling center for a large metropolitan area.  The tool also employs an optimization model which allows for the analysis of tradeoffs between two objectives: 1) minimization of the fraction of calls which are not answered within 12 seconds, and 2) minimization of the number of call taker hours scheduled.
