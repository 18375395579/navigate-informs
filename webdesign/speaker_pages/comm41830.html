Title: A Single Settlement Energy only Market to Harness Wind Generation<br>Author: Golbon Zakeri, University of Auckland, 70 Symonds Street, Auckland, New Zealand, g.zakeri@auckland.ac.nz<br>Coauthor(s): Geoff Pritchard, Andy Philpott<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We discuss a stochastic-programming-based method for scheduling electric power generation subject to  uncertainty. Such uncertainty may arise from either imperfect forecasting or moment-to-moment fluctuations,  and on either the supply or the demand side. The method gives a system of locational marginal prices  which reflect the uncertainty, and these may be used in a market settlement scheme in which payment is for energy only.  We show that this scheme is revenue-adequate in expectation.
