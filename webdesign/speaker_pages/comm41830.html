Such uncertainty may arise from either imperfect forecasting or moment-to-moment fluctuations,  and on either the supply or the demand side. The method gives a system of locational marginal prices  which reflect the uncertainty, and these may be used in a market settlement scheme in which payment is for energy only.  We show that this scheme is revenue-adequate in expectation.</br>
