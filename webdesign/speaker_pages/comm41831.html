The tool is developed in ArcGIS, using Visual Basic and C-programming. In the developed tool, origin and/or destination of a trip can be either a single node, or a set of nodes within a Traffic Analysis Zone/county/whole-network. In addition, the developed tool assesses short term impacts of infrastructure investments on the FMC of trips.</br>
