Title: Evaluating Capacity Investments Using a GIS-Based Tool - Network-Wide Full Marginal Cost Approach<br>Author: Kaan Ozbay, Associate Professor, Rutgers University, 623 Bowser Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, kaan@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Yanmaz-Tuzel, Sandeep Mudigonda, Bekir Bartin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a constrained k-shortest path algorithm to estimate the trip-based FMC of a trip along a set of feasible paths between each O-D pair. The tool is developed in ArcGIS, using Visual Basic and C-programming. In the developed tool, origin and/or destination of a trip can be either a single node, or a set of nodes within a Traffic Analysis Zone/county/whole-network. In addition, the developed tool assesses short term impacts of infrastructure investments on the FMC of trips.
