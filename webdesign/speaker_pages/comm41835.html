Title: A Stochastic Mixed-integer Programming Approach to Facility and Energy-technology Management<br>Author: Stephen Stoyan, Analytics Manager, Starbucks Coffee Company, 2401 Utah Street S., Seattle, WA, 98134, United States of America, sstoyan@starbucks.com<br>Coauthor(s): Maged Dessouky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a model that addresses facility location and employs energy technologies that aim to improve a companies carbon footprint. The approach involves a Stochastic Mixed-Integer Program (SMIP) that minimizes cost, emission levels, etc. while also considering the optimal location in the companies network.  The results provide encouraging outcomes with respect to cost, emission levels, and energy-technologies that should be utilized for future generation.
