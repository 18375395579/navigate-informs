The approach involves a Stochastic Mixed-Integer Program (SMIP) that minimizes cost, emission levels, etc. while also considering the optimal location in the companies network.  The results provide encouraging outcomes with respect to cost, emission levels, and energy-technologies that should be utilized for future generation.</br>
