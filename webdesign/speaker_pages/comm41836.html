<br>Title: PBS: Priority Based Blind Scheduling</br><br>Author: Vishal Misra, Associate Professor, Columbia University, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, New York, NY, United States, misra@cs.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Rubenstein, Hanhua Feng</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A novel CPU scheduling policy is designed and implemented. It is a configurable policy in the sense that a tunable parameter is provided to change its behavior. With different settings of the parameter, this policy can emulate the first-come first-serve, the processor sharing, or the feedback policies, as well as arbitrarily different levels of their mixtures. This policy is implemented in the Linux kernel as a replacement of the default scheduler, and it's performance analyzed with different workloads and benchmarks. The scheduler's superior performance under different workloads indicate its promise as a configurable replacement for a wide variety of schedulers.</br>
