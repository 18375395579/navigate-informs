Title: Task Mapping for Non-contiguous Allocations<br>Author: Vitus Leung, Sandia National Labs, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, United States of America, vjleung@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): David Bunde, Johnathan Ebbers, Nickolas Price, Matthew Swank, Stefan Feer, Zachary Rhodes<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Several studies have shown that task placement affects job running time for both contiguously and non-contiguously allocated jobs. This paper examines task mapping algorithms for non-contiguously allocated parallel jobs. We apply novel and adapted task mapping algorithms to this setting and evaluate them using experiments and simulations. Our strategies improve running time by as much as thirty percent over a baseline strategy. Furthermore, this improvement increases markedly with the job size.
