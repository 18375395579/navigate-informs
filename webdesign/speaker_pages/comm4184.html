Title: Improving Portfolio Performance by Constraining the Portfolio Norms<br>Author: Victor de Miguel, Associate Professor, London Business School, Regents Park, London, UK, United Kingdom, avmiguel@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francisco Nogales<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: To reduce the impact of estimation error on portfolio performance, we propose computing the portfolios that minimize the sample variance subject to the additional constraint that the norm of the portfolio-weight vector must be smaller than a certain threshold. We show that these portfolios generalize several policies from the literature. Our empirical results show that the proposed portfolios perform very well out-of-sample.
