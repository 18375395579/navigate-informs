Title: Optimal Portfolio Liquidation with a Markov Chain Approximation Approach<br>Author: Jingnan Chen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, United States of America, jchen98@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Liming Feng, Jiming Peng<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper considers the optimal portfolio liquidation problem where the objective is to minimize trading cost and risk when financial portfolios are liquidated over a short period of time. We propose Markov chain approximation approaches for computing the optimal trading strategies numerically and for studying analytical properties of such strategies.
