Title: On Computational Experiment in the Parallel Public Transportation System<br>Author: Runmei Li, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, rmli@bjtu.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): JiangZhong Liu, Fenghua Zhu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The problem of how to carry out the computational experiments in the parallel public transportation system is studied. The computational experiments is done by the following three steps: determining the initial departure time of the buses; adjusting the initial departure time in a small interval in order to get some experiment plans, and then, applying these adjusted departure times to the parallel public transportation system and choosing the suitable departure time.
