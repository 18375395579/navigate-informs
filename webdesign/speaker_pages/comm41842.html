Title: Dynamic Tolling Strategies for Managed Lanes<br>Author: Yingyan Lou, University of Florida, Department of Civil & Costal Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, yingyan@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper proposes two practical but sensible approaches to determine pricing strategies for operating managed or express toll lanes. The tolls vary dynamically in response to real-time traffic conditions in order to provide a superior free-flow travel service to the users of the toll lanes as well as maximize the freeway's throughput rate. A simulation study is conducted to validate and compare the proposed approaches.
