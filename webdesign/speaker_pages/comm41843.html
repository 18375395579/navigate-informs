<br>Title: Real Time Integer Programming to Improve Ambulance Response Time at San Francisco Fire Department</br><br>Author: Jodi Blomberg, Technical Architect, SAS, 6501 S Fiddler's Green Circle, Greenwood Village, CO, 80111, United States of America, jodi.blomberg@sas.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bill Storti</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The San Francisco Fire Department positions ambulances for emergency response. An integer programming model places ambulances to minimize the distance to call volume. As ambulances go out on calls, using the original model to reposition all remaining ambulances is an impractical solution. Rather, additional constraints were added to the model to determine the best way to reposition a limited number of ambulances. This real time information can be fed to the dispatcher to improve response times.</br>
