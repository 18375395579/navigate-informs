Title: Time Varying Maximum Flow Problem With Polynomial Capacities and Flows<br>Author: Farid Alizadeh, Professor, Rutgers  Business School, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Rd, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, farid.alizadeh@rutgers.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the maximum flow problem in a network where each arc has a time varying capacity: a univariate polynomial of fixed degree. We seek time varying polynomials representing instantaneous flow on each arc such that the total flow into the sink between times 0 and 1 is maximal. Nonnegative flow should not exceed capacity at any instance between 0 and 1. This problem can be solved by semidefinite programming. We examine extension of classical methods using augmenting paths.
