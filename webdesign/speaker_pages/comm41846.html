This paper presents a sensor-driven adaptive spare part replenishment strategy for several machines of the same type. A joint estimation approach is utilized to quantify the health status of each machine for updating the system-level replenishment strategy. An example of a bench top CNC milling machine is provided for demonstration.</br>
