Title: Information Concentration in Common Value Environments<br>Author: Mikhael Shor, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, United States of America, mike.shor@uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vladimir Mares<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider how information concentration affects a seller’s revenue in common value auctions. The common value is a function of n random variables partitioned among m <= n bidders. For each partition, the seller devises an optimal mechanism. We show that whenever the value function allows scalar sufficient statistics and a common regularity condition is satisfied, a coarser partition always reduces revenues. In particular, any merger or collusion among bidders reduces revenue.
