Title: Saving Seats: Reservation Policies with Strategic Customers<br>Author: Martin Lariviere, Professor, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern Univeristy, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL, 60091, United States, m-lariviere@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eren Cil<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider a service provider dealing with two sets of customers.  The first segment contacts the provider before the date of service and only patronize the firm if they can reserve access to the provider’s limited capacity.  The second segment is made up of walk-in customers who only arrive at the time of service and have a cost to access the provider.  We examine the interplay between the amount of reservations given out and demand from walk-in customers.
