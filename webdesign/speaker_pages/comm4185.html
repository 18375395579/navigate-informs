Here, frequent changes of speed as often observed in peak times increase emissions significantly. To this end, Dijkstra’s algorithm is extended by time-dependent sampling, which allows for more realistic estimation of emission and arrival time functions. Based on a large real-world data set, results will show that our approach yields less emissions than common distance and travel based optimization.</br>
