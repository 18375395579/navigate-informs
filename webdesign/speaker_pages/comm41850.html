An algorithm is proposed to solve the problem with general distributions of value of time and cost of schedule delay. The uniqueness and the existence conditions of user equilibriums are explored.  Another algorithm s introduced to solve the system optima in which queuing delay is eliminated by a system optimum (SO) toll scheme.
