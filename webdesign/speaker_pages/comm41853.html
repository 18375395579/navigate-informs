In general, players' behavior may be irrational, non-strategic, misinformed or biased. Thus, we use robust optimization to study screening policy with uncertainty about the applicants' strategic ability, utility functions, and constraints, and how sensitive their optimal decisions and expected payoffs are to those uncertainties and the desired level of robustness.</br>
