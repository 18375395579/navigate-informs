Title: Service Times in Multi-echelon Systems<br>Author: Ton de Kok, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Dept. Technology Management, P.O. Box 513, Eindhoven, 5600 MB, Netherlands, a.g.d.kok@tm.tue.nl<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider general multi-echelon systems under synchronized base stock policies. We translate the concept of service times proposed by Simpson a.o. to this situation. We show how to compute optimal service times based on service level constraints for each item and how to use them in MRP systems.
