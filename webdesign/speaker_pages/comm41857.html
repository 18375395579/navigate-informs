We show a local search procedure that converges to the optimal schedule with a weighted average of expected waiting times of patients, idle time of the doctor and tardiness as an objective. We allow for no-shows to happen. For certain combinations of parameters we find the well-known Bailey-Welch rule as optimal appointment schedule.</br>
