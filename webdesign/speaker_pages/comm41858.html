Title: Strictly Proper Mechanisms with Cooperating Players<br>Author: Ross Shachter, Associate Professor, Stanford University, Department of Management Science and Eng, Huang Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, shachter@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): SangIn Chun<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Prediction markets provide an efficient means to assess uncertain quantities from forecasters.  Although traditional and competitive strictly proper scoring rules have been shown to incentivize forecasters to provide accurate probabilistic forecasts acting alone, when forecasters with different beliefs can cooperate, these mechanisms instead discourage honest reports.  Nonetheless, we show conditions under which the decision maker can confidently apply the assessed probabilities.
