Title: Task Selection, Assignment and Sequencing in Multistage Batch Processes<br>Author: Christos Maravelias, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Wisconsin at Madison, 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, christos@engr.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pradeep Prasad<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a novel MIP model for the scheduling of multistage batch processes with parallel units of different capacities. The problem is difficult because orders cannot be a priori assigned to batches. Thus, selection, as well as assignment and sequencing decisions are required. To solve large instances we develop an algorithm that lends itself to parallelization.
