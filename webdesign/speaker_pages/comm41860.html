We construct a stable cost allocation with budget balance guarantee equal to the Held-Karp integrality gap for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem, using a new variant of the Held-Karp relaxation and a previously unknown connection to linear production games. We provide examples in which stable cost allocations necessarily have poor budget balance guarantees, and discuss their implications on future work.</br>
