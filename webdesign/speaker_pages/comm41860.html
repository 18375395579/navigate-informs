Title: On Traveling Salesman Games with Asymmetric Costs<br>Author: Nelson Uhan, Assistant Professor, United States Naval Academy, Chauvenet Hall, Annapolis, MD, 21402, United States of America, uhan@usna.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alejandro Toriello<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study cooperative traveling salesman games with asymmetric costs. We construct a stable cost allocation with budget balance guarantee equal to the Held-Karp integrality gap for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem, using a new variant of the Held-Karp relaxation and a previously unknown connection to linear production games. We provide examples in which stable cost allocations necessarily have poor budget balance guarantees, and discuss their implications on future work.
