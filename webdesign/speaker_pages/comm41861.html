<br>Title: Testing the Regular Ultra Passum (RUP) Law with a Convex DEA-technology</br><br>Author: Ole Bent Olesen, Professor, University of Southern Denmark, Department of Business and Economics, Campusvej 55, Odense M, DK 5230, Denmark, ole@sam.sdu.dk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Niels Christian Petersen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The nature of scale properties in DEA is at focus. DEA may have some irregular properties concerning the shape of the optimal scale curve/the M-locus. Imposing a maintained hypothesis of the Regular Ultra Passum (RUP) law (R. Frisch) on a piecewise linear estimator of the technology would stabilize these properties. Concerning the convex hull estimator (the BCC-model) we derive a test for this hypothesis and propose some modifications of this estimator if the RUP-law is violated.</br>
