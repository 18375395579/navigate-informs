Title: Reconciling Strategic and Tactical Fleet Inventory Targets with Cyclical Demand<br>Author: Michael Gorman, Associate Professor, University of Dayton, School of Business, Dayton, OH, United States, Michael.Gorman@notes.udayton.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Rolling stock fleets must be managed on an on-going basis so that they are positioned where they provide the greatest value for the fleet owner.  We evaluate models for the optimal strategic and tactical strategies for establishing target fleet inventory levels in the face of highly cyclical weekly demand. We observe that strategic and tactical targets may not always agree.  We further develop an approach for the estimating the cost of deviaiton from optimal fleet targets.
