Title: Capacitated Period Routing<br>Author: David Ronen, Professor of Logistics and Operations Management, University of Missouri-St. Louis, 214 Computer Center Bldg., One University Boulevard, St. Louis, MO, 63121-4499, United States, david.ronen@umsl.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: With increased productivity and expanding demand less and less spare capacity is available in operations. We designed a system for planning store deliveries at a major retailer. This is a Period (Vehicle) Routing Problem with tight constraints on DC picking volume and on transportation capacities. We took a three-stage approach, at the core of which is an ILP model for assigning store clusters to weekly delivery patterns.
