<br>Title: Location-Allocation of Service Units on a Congested Network</br><br>Author: Oded Berman, Professor, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, Berman@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zvi Drezner, Robert Aboolian</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of locating and allocating servers on a congested network. The service and demand processes are assumed to be Poisson distributed. The objective is to minimize the total fixed installation, variable, travel time and waiting time costs. Analysis of the problem, exact and approximate solution approaches are presented.</br>
