Title: A Joint Surveillance and Patrol Problem for Law Enforcement<br>Author: Belleh Fontem, PhD Candidate, The University of Alabama, 300 Alston Hall, 361 Stadium Drive, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487, United States of America, bafontem@crimson.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sharif Melouk, Burcu Keskin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate the problem of using unmanned aerial systems (UASs) as visual aids to ground law enforcement agents while assigning dangerous incidents to these agents in order to maximize the cumulative harm averted to society. We introduce a very tight formulation of the resulting team orienteering problem and and draw insights from theoretical analyses as well as from numerical experiments.
