Title: Physical Commodity Trading in a Network and Its Impact on Prices<br>Author: Victor Martinez de Albeniz, Assistant Professor, IESE Business School, Av. Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, valbeniz@iese.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider in this paper the trading of a single commodity in several locations which define a network. We model shipping capacity constraints through quadratic trading costs. We first analyze the basic strategy of a trader between two nodes, which affects prices in each node. This allows us to characterize the (stochastic) price evolution in the nodes over time. We use the model to analyze numerically the kerosene price differences between New York, Los Angeles and the Gulf Coast.
