Title: Control of a Two-Class Call Center with Upgrades<br>Author: Mark Lewis, Associate Professor, School of Operations Research and Industrial Engineering, Cornell University, 226 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, mel47@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Doug Down<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consider a call center with two classes, modeled as parallel queues, and (random) customer upgrades from the second class to the first class. We study the problem of resource allocation in this system under several decision-making scenarios. In the first, a single decision-maker must allocate finite capacity between each class. We then extend to multiple servers at each station. Structural results are obtained via sample path and MDP arguments.
