Each customer requests one unit of the resource for a certain period of time which is a-priori random; if served, he/she is willing to pay for the resource. Our goal is to find admission policies that (i) Can be computed efficiently; (ii) Are intuitive conceptually; (iii) Admit worst-case performance guarantees for any value of capacity C.</br>
