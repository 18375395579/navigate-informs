<br>Title: Towing Processes at Airports ?What is the Optimal Fleet Mix?</br><br>Author: Jia Yan Du, Technische Universität München, Arcisstr. 21, München, Ba, 803333, Germany, jia-yan.du@wi.tum.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rainer Kolisch, Jens Brunner</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Towing tractors are required to push plans off the gate before departure. Tractors differ with respect to investment costs, variable costs and plane type compatibility. We address the question of the cost minimal fleet mix. For this we introduce a MIP which takes into account a maximum lifetime, an overhaul option and a sell option. In a case study we derive an optimal fleet (de-)investment plan for a towing service provider at a cooperating airport considering various demand forecast scenarios.</br>
