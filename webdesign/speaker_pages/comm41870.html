<br>Title: Estimating Primary Demand for Substitutable Products from Sales Transaction Data</br><br>Author: Garrett van Ryzin, Professor, Columbia University, 412 Uris Hall, NY, NY, 10027, United States of America, gjv1@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gustavo Vulcano, Richard Ratliff</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider an approach for estimating substitute and lost retail demand when only sales transaction data are available and not all products are available in all periods. The problem we consider is how to jointly estimate the parameters of a choice model and arrival rates using only sales transaction data. We develop an efficient algorithm based on estimating primary (first-choice) demand and illustrate it on two industry data sets.</br>
