It produces more than 20 million tons which is transported with trains to two harbours. In order to increase the production, LKAB needs to optimize its train logistics. We report on a modeling system and experiences that is used to schedule locomotives and wagons including maintenance. This is the basis for what-if-scenarios including new locomotives, new terminals and the opening of two mines.</br>
