<br>Title: Maintenance Scheduling Model for Thermal Generators</br><br>Author: Jasper Quach, University of South Florida, 15339 westminister ave., Clearwater, FL, 33760, United States of America, jasper@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng, Brian Buckley</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Thermal generators are subject to performance degradation and random failures. In particular, coal-fired generators are typically old and suffer serious reliability issue, resulting in only 75 ?85% availability year round. To address this challenge, we developed an optimization model to determine the optimal schedule for generating assets to minimize the gap between demand and generation capacity. We expect the research will ultimately increase power reliability, reduce cost and meet demand.</br>
