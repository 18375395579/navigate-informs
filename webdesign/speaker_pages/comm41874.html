Title: The Network Restoration Ratio and Meshiness<br>Author: John Klincewicz, Principal Member of Technical Staff, AT&T Labs, 200 South Laurel Avenue, Room D5-3C06, Middletown, NJ, 07748, United States of America, klincewicz@att.com<br>Coauthor(s): Herbert Shulman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Given a set of nodes and traffic demands, an important problem is to find a minimum cost topology (links and link capacities) that can carry the traffic under normal and failure conditions.  In our investigation, we studied the relationship between “Restoration Ratio? a measure of overbuild, and Average Node Degree, a measure of “meshiness.? In this talk, we describe a number of interesting empirical results relating these two measures, based on an analysis of a large number of networks.
