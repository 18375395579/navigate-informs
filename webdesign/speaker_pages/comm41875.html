Title: Sequential Facility Location-allocation for Fast Pyrolysis Biofuel Production Network<br>Author: Yihua Li, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States of America, yihuali@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guiping Hu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The revised Renewable Fuel Standard mandates the U.S. to consume 16 BGY of cellulosic biofuel by 2022. Fast pyrolysis is a thermochemical process to produce liquid transportation fuels from cellulosic biomass. A sequential facility siting problem is formulated to optimize an orderly fast pyrolysis facility location and capacity that maximize the net present value (NPV) of the total profit during the next 10 years (2013-2022). Numerical examples based on a case study for Iowa are also presented.
