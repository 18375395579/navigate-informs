Fast pyrolysis is a thermochemical process to produce liquid transportation fuels from cellulosic biomass. A sequential facility siting problem is formulated to optimize an orderly fast pyrolysis facility location and capacity that maximize the net present value (NPV) of the total profit during the next 10 years (2013-2022). Numerical examples based on a case study for Iowa are also presented.</br>
