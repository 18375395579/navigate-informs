Title: Open Queuing Network Model for Autonomous Vehicle Storage and Retrieval Systems (AVSRS)<br>Author: Sunderesh Heragu, Professor and Duthie Chair in Engineering Logistics, University of Louisville, Room 309, JB Speed Building, Department of Industrial Engineering, Louisville, KY, 40292, United States, s.heragu@louisville.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cai Xiao<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss application of an open queuing network model for a warehouse with multiple storage levels. The storage and retrieval are done by autonomous vehicles that are restricted to travel within a designated level. To move pallet loads between different levels, a mechanism to transfer the pallet load from a vehicle to an elevator and from the elevator to another vehicle at another level is assumed to be available.
