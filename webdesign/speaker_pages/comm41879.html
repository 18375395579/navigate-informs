Title: Storage Operations and Investments in an Electrical System<br>Author: Santhosh Suresh, PhD, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan St, ANN ARBOR, MI, 48109, United States of America, sssandy@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Roman Kapuscinski, Owen Wu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Storage technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in today's electric grid. We discuss the optimal siting and sizing of storage units in the view of minimizing overall operating costs accounting for transmission losses unlike individual profit maximization setting in most previous literature. We show the degree of storage pooling to be related structurally with: the efficiency of storage and transmission, variance, correlation and mean in the demand distribution; using a three node model.
