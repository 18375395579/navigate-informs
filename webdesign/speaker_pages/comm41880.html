<br>Title: Managing Underperformance Risk in Project Portfolio Selection</br><br>Author: Jin Qi, National University of Singapore, Singapore, qijin@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Melvyn Sim, Nicholas G. Hall, Zhuoyu Long</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a project selection problem where each project has an uncertain return with partially characterized probability distribution. The decision maker selects a feasible subset of projects so that the risk of the portfolio return not meeting a specified target is minimized. Our work extends the riskiness index of Aumann and Serrano (2008) by incorporating the target and also distributional ambiguity. We minimize the underperformance risk and capture correlation and interaction effects.</br>
