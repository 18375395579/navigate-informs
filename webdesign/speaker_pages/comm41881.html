The method considers that in such networks, communication among mobile nodes is enabled through one or more backbone sub-networks, which have significant impact on the reliability of the MAWN and thus, are critical for its reliable operation. This method is the basis of an optimization model where the objective is to maximize reliability via the design of backbone networks yet constrained by cost and/or weight.</br>
