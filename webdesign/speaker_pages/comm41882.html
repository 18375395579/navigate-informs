Title: Adaptive Control Variates for Pricing Multi-Dimensional American Options<br>Author: Samuel Ehrlichman, PhD Student, Cornell University, School of ORIE, 294 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States, se52@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shane Henderson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We explore a class of control variates for the American option pricing problem.  Using regression splines, we approximate the option's value function at each time step and combine the resulting functions to construct a martingale that approximates a perfect control variate. Significant variance reduction is possible even in a high-dimensional setting. The technique is applicable to a wide variety of option contract specifications and underlying stochastic processes.
