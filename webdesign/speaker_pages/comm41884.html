Linear programming may be used to decide what rate to serve each campaign in each inventory type; however, 1) as targeting becomes sophisticated the number of inventory types grows combinatorially; and 2) the number of impressions of each inventory type is unknown ex-ante.  We explore some decomposition techniques and provide experimental results applied to the scheduling of ads in online video games.
