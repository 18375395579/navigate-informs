Title: Optimal Scheduling of Automotive Glass Furnaces<br>Author: Yakov Fradkin, Research Scientist, Ford Motor Company, 2101 Village Rd, MD 2122, Dearborn, MI, 48121, United States of America, yfradkin@ford.com<br>Coauthor(s): Giuseppe Rossi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Glass furnaces are continuous operations producing glass of different colors and thicknesses for automotive and other applications. Changeover times are sequence dependent. We consider the problem of devising an optimal schedule given the level of available product storage and given patterns of demand and demand variability. We develop both analytical and computational models: the latter use composite variables, that encapsulate a number of business rules into a single modeling object.
