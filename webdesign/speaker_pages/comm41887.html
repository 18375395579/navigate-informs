Title: Integrated Departure Route Planning<br>Author: Dr. Lixia Song, Lead Modeling & Simulation Engineer, MITRE, 7515 Colshire Dr., Mclean, VA, 22102, United States of America, lixia@mitre.org<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This research is to develop algorithms to determine and rank the available reroute options for departure traffic. Filed flight plans and acceptable alternatives, predicted convective weather impacts on airspace resources (route, fix, sector, etc.), predicted airspace congestion, and forecast uncertainty all must be considered in evaluating the reroute options.
