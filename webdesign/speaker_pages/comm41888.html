<br>Title: Cost-effectiveness of Task Assignments with an Application to Military Planning</br><br>Author: Ahti Salo, Professor, Aalto University, Dept of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, Systems Analysis Laboratory, Aalto, 00076, Finland, ahti.salo@aalto.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jussi Kangaspunta</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider portfolio problems in which agents are assigned to tasks with the aim of maximizing the total value resulting from the completion of tasks while minimizing the costs arising from these assignments. We determine for a range of cost levels which assignments are cost-effective in the presence of incomplete information about the value of these tasks. We also analyze which agent-task combinations outperform others based on sets of value judgments stated by different groups of experts.</br>
