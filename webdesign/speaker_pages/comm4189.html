Title: Control of a Queueing System with Nonidentical Servers<br>Author: Mike Pinedo, Professor, NYU, Stern School of Business, New York University, NY, NY, 10012, United States of America, mpinedo@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiuli Chao<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Consider a queueing system with m nonidentical servers in parallel.  Customers arrive according to an arbitrary renewal process.  A customer of type j can only be served by a specific subset of the m servers.  The service time  of a customer is arbitrarily distributed according to F.   We assume that the subsets of the servers of the different classes are nested and we develop conditions under which a scheme that gives priority to the least flexible customer performs optimally.
