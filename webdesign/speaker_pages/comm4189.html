Customers arrive according to an arbitrary renewal process.  A customer of type j can only be served by a specific subset of the m servers.  The service time  of a customer is arbitrarily distributed according to F.   We assume that the subsets of the servers of the different classes are nested and we develop conditions under which a scheme that gives priority to the least flexible customer performs optimally.</br>
