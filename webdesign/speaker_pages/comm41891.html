Title: Adversarial Patrolling on Networks<br>Author: Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Sandia National Labs, 7011 East Ave, Livermore, CA, 94550, United States of America, eug.vorobey@gmail.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We will address the problem of patrolling physical infrastructure on a network when an adversary aims to inflict damage on a target.  We show that, in general, there exists a Stackelberg equilibrium in Markovian stationary strategies, and present general-purpose solution techniques.  Additionally, we offer highly scalable methods for special cases.
