Max Shen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a reliable facility location model that allows disruptions to be correlated with an uncertain joint distribution, and minimizes the expected cost under the worst-case distribution. We believe this robust optimization model could serve as an alternative approach for solving reliable facility location problems. Compared to the traditional approach, it better captures disruption propagation effect, requires much less computational effort, and delivers more favorable designs.
