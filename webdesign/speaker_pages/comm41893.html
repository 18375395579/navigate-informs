Title: Energy Station Location Problem in a Transportation Network with Autonomous Users<br>Author: Yingyan Lou, Assistant Professor, The University of Alabama, 260 H.M.

We first develop a capacitated SLP with constant travel time and stepwise delay function at each station. We also extend this model to consider varying travel time and continuous delay function with autonomous users following the user equilibrium conditions to better capture travelers?behaviors in the network. These models are solved by specialized branch-and-bound and Lagrangian relaxation algorithms.
