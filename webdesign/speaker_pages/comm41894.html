Title: Start-up Prices and Shadow Prices in Binary MILP Problems<br>Author: Suvrajeet Sen, Professor, The Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, sen.22@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Talat Genc<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The issue of finding a price system in MILP models with attributes of shadow prices has remained a long-standing unresolved problem in both optimization and economic theory. In this presentation, we resolve this issue for binary MILP problems. We provide an important step in allocating charges of indivisible goods, and recover the total costs of inputs. Moreover, we characterize unique (two-sided) shadow prices for resources in binary MILP problems.
