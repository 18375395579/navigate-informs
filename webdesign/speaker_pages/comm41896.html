Title: Spatially Differentiated Trade of Permits for Multipollutant Electric  Power Supply Chains with Power Plants of Distinct Technologies<br>Author: Trisha Woolley, University of Massachusetts, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, twoolley@som.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Stranlund, Anna Nagurney<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper, we model the electric power supply chain network in which the  power generators have distinct power plants and associated technologies and  multiple tradable pollution permits with spatially distinct receptor points.  We formulate the governing equilibrium conditions as a finite-dimensional  variational inequality and consider special cases as well as present numerical  examples.
