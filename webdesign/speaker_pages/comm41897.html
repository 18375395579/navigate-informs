Title: Towards the Dominating Set Edge Blocker Problem<br>Author: Jose L. Walteros, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, jwalteros@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vladimir Boginski, Panos Pardalos, Foad Mahdavi Pajouh<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the problem of removing a subset of edges of minimum cardinality, such that the weight of any dominating set in the remaining graph is bounded below by a given constant r. This problem can be seen as a generalization of the minimum bondage set problem and is motivated from the practical need of evaluating robustness and vulnerability of any given graph in terms of preserving the weight of the dominating sets while its edges are being removed.
