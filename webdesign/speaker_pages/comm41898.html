Title: A Reliability Model for the Stochastic RCPSP<br>Author: Patricio Lamas, KU Leuven, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, Belgium, Patricio.LamasVilches@econ.kuleuven.be<br>Coauthor(s): Erik Demeulemeester<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this presentation we consider the stochastic RCPSP where the stochasticity is incurred because either resource availabilities or activity durations are uncertain. We model the problem as a Chance Constrained Program. The objective is to minimize the project makespan under a predefined reliability level.
