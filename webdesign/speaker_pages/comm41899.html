Title: Multi-objective Optimization of a Contingency Logistics Network<br>Author: Edward Pohl, Associate Professor, University of Arkansas, Department of Industrial Engineering, Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, epohl@uark.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A contingency logistic network can be responsible for resourcing several missions at the same time with different levels of desirability for mission success. Furthermore, depending on the time and budget available at each node or region in the network, a decision maker has a different level of cost and time tolerance for the different missions. In this paper, Physical Programming is used in conjunction with a memetic algorithm to optimize the performance of a contingency logistics network.
