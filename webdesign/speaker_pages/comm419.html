<br>Title: Debris Flow Hazard Management via Global Optimization</br><br>Author: Vitaliy A. Krasko, Colorado School of Mines, Engineering Hall, 816 15th Street, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, vkrasko@mymail.mines.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Timo Lohmann, Kevin McCoy, Steffen Rebennack, Paul Santi, Daniel Kaffine</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Debris flows are fast moving landslides consisting of a mixture of debris which can include logs and boulders. We derive a coupled natural-social science model that provides guidance for allocation of scare management resources towards reducing the economic impacts of debris flows. We present a highly non-convex optimization problem which optimizes the allocating of scarce funds into prevention of debris flow occurrences, reduction of debris flow volume, and protection of people and property.</br>
