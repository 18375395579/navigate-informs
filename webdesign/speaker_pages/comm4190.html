Title: Perfusion Production Planning<br>Author: Dan Bu, University of California, Berkeley, IEOR Dept., Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, julia200907@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Phil Kaminsky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by a specific type of semi-batch biotech manufacturing, perfusion, we consider production planning and control for processes where manufacturing has to be periodically restarted and yield is random, but is known soon after processing begins.  In this setting, firms must decide when to start and when to restart production of multiple products to minimize costs and to meet customer service requirements.
