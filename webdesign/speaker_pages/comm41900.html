Title: Intertemporal Pricing for a Capacity Constrained Just-in-time Supply Chain<br>Author: Dehui Tong, University of Toronto, 105 St. George St. PhD Program, Toronto, ON, M5S3E6, Canada, dehui.tong@rotman.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Opher Baron, Joseph Milner<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a hierarchical planning model for a capacity constrained service system for multiple customer classes with heterogenous schedule preferences. Strategic level prices are determined to regulate customers' preferences. Customers observe posted prices, arrive and are assigned capacity slots dynamically over a planning horizon. Extension to overbooking is discussed.
