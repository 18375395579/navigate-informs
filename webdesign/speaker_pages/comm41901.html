Title: The Error in Steady-State Approximations for Time-Dependent Performance Measures<br>Author: Shane Henderson, Associate Professor, Cornell University, School of ORIE, 230 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, sgh9@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samuel Steckley<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Arrival processes to queues invariably exhibit time dependence, but such queues are difficult to analyze. Usually one adopts some kind of steady-state approximation for time-dependent performance. We develop approximations for the resulting error for a range of queueing models. The results reinforce and extend what is known about such errors.
