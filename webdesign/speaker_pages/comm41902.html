Title: A Model for Risk Management in a Supply Chain<br>Author: Helene Tokou, Student (PHD), The University of Iowa, Department of CS 14 MacLean Hall, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, htokou@engineering.uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dennis L. Bricker<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Robust operation of a supply chain should allow for corrective  actions (recourses) to recover from any possible disruption (scenario). A stochastic program can manage risk of disruption by selecting decisions to minimize the maximum regret over all foreseeable scenarios. Because 100% reliability of the supply chain may be unrealistic, it allows for the exclusion of a set of scenarios   with acceptably low total probability. A decomposition scheme is described for the optimization of the model.
