Bricker</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Robust operation of a supply chain should allow for corrective  actions (recourses) to recover from any possible disruption (scenario). A stochastic program can manage risk of disruption by selecting decisions to minimize the maximum regret over all foreseeable scenarios. Because 100% reliability of the supply chain may be unrealistic, it allows for the exclusion of a set of scenarios   with acceptably low total probability. A decomposition scheme is described for the optimization of the model.</br>
