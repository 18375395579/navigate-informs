In current practice, however, the FAA does not explicitly consider the delay-related costs incurred by passengers; but permits airlines to adjust assigned delays (where passengers may be considered).  We show that if the FAA were to directly consider the delays incurred by passengers, it could be substantially reduce (30-40%) the overall delay cost incurred by passengers during a GDP.</br>
