Title: Competitive Analysis of Port Production and Trucking Emissions<br>Author: Bruce Hartman, Professor, University of St Francis, 500 Wilcox St, Joliet, IL, 60435, United States of America, bhartman@stfrancis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Clott<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Controlling harbor truck emissions is an important requirement for sustainable port operations. The burden imposed may well drive business to other ports. We use a nonlinear optimization model with Cournot competition between ports for throughput at a given emissions level; a port chooses the percentage of trucks to upgrade. We identify shadow prices for emission levels and output, and determine whether side payment subsidies to insure cooperation are necessary.
