The burden imposed may well drive business to other ports. We use a nonlinear optimization model with Cournot competition between ports for throughput at a given emissions level; a port chooses the percentage of trucks to upgrade. We identify shadow prices for emission levels and output, and determine whether side payment subsidies to insure cooperation are necessary.</br>
