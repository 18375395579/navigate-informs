<br>Title: Expense Constrained Bidder Optimization in Repeated Auctions</br><br>Author: Ramakrishna Gummadi, Stanford University, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, gummadi@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Key, Alexandre Proutiere</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the online bidding problem of an agent involved in repeated auctions against a stationary random environment. The bidder has expense constraints modeled by a time varying balance and a non-negative income that augments the balance after each auction. For a limiting scenario motivated by sponsored search auction markets, we present a convergence result that reduces the optimal bidding strategy in repeated auctions to its equivalent static version.</br>
