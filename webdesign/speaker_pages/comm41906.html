Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, hwang7@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yanfeng Ouyang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: It is assumed that a congestion state of each highway segment follows a known probability distribution while local road has identical congestion state. This study deals with the problem of truck driver who decides whether to use highway or local road at each decision point to minimize expected total cost including carbon emission. Dynamic programming approach is adopted.
