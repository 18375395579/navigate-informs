<br>Title: Extremely Hard to Borrow (Bankrupt) Stocks</br><br>Author: Richard Sowers, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States of America, r-sowers@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiao Li, Michael Lipkin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We extend a model of Avellaneda and Lipkin to cover extremely hard-to-borrow (bankrupt) stocks.  The only source in stochasticity is Poisson relaxations after short squeezes.  We find asymptotic formulae and a risk-neutral model.</br>
