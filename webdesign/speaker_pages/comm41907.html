Title: Extremely Hard to Borrow (Bankrupt) Stocks<br>Author: Richard Sowers, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States of America, r-sowers@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiao Li, Michael Lipkin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We extend a model of Avellaneda and Lipkin to cover extremely hard-to-borrow (bankrupt) stocks.  The only source in stochasticity is Poisson relaxations after short squeezes.  We find asymptotic formulae and a risk-neutral model.
