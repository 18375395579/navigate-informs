<br>Title: Optimization Models for the Equitable Assignment of Slot Lifetime</br><br>Author: Moein Ganji, University of Maryland, 3429 Tulane Dr.,, Apt 24, Hyattsville, MD, 20783, United States, moein_g@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The FAA is investigating new airport slot management policies that involve the use of  “Operating Authorizations?with finite lifetimes.  Since expiration dates must be staggered, the initial lifetimes assigned will vary between one and ten years.  We develop integer programming and heuristic methods for the equitable assignment of lifetimes.  Equity is measured relative to the historic slot ownership/use.</br>
