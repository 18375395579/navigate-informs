Title: Maximizing Service Productivity through Task Routing Rules<br>Author: Geoff Ryder, Ph.D. Candidate, University of California - Santa Cruz, 4190 Sophia Way, San Jose, CA, 95134, United States of America, gryder@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Ross, Christoph Heitz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Call center routing rules assign incoming customer traffic to agents in order to meet pressing short-term goals.  Here we add a new objective:  we seek to develop and maintain agent expertise over time by taking into account on-the-job learning, forgetting, and turnover trends.  We present routing rules that balance skill development with other objectives, and in so doing we optimize the distribution of skills among the workforce of agents.
