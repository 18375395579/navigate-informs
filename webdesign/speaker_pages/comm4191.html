Title: Cheap Talk in Queues with Multiple Customer Classes<br>Author: Gad Allon, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL, United States of America, g-allon@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Achal Bassamboo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We examine the problem of information communication by considering a model in which both the firm and the customers act strategically. In this model, the customers are heterogeneous both with regards to their waiting cost and the value they obtain from the service. The customer type is private information. We characterize the equilibrium language that emerges between the service provider and her customers.
