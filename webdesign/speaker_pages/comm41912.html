<br>Title: Runway Assignments that Minimize Terminal Airspace and Airport Surface Emissions</br><br>Author: John-Paul Clarke, Associate Professor, Georgia Tech, 270 Ferst Drive N.W., Atlanta, GA, 30332-0150, United States of America, johnpaul@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bosung Kim, Leihong Li</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Arrivals and departures often experience unnecessary delays and generate unnecessary emissions during peak periods because one or more runways at an airport are in great demand while other runways at the same airport are underutilized. We present an optimization model for simultaneously assigning aircraft to runways, and scheduling the arrival and departure operations on these runways, such that the total emissions produced in the terminal area and on the airport surface is minimized.</br>
