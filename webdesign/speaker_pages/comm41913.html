A mathematical model is adopted to solve train conflicts through reordering and local rerouting (dynamic use of platform tracks and alternative corridors). Rolling stock and passenger connections are also formulated. An iterative reordering and rerouting algorithm is developed to increase the punctuality. Experiments on a Dutch railway network show that the algorithm improves the solutions provided by practical dispatching rules.</br>
