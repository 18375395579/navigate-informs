Title: Exact Sampling of Jump-diffusions<br>Author: Dmitry Smelov, Stanford University, 141M Huang Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, dsmelov@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kay Giesecke<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a method for the exact simulation of a skeleton, hitting time and other functionals of a 1-dimensional jump-diffusion with state-dependent drift, volatility, jump intensity and jump size. It requires the drift function to be C1, the volatility function to be C2, the intensity function to be locally bounded, and leads to unbiased simulation estimators of security prices, transition densities, and other quantities. We also discuss extensions of the method to the multidimensional case.
