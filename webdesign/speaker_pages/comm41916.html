Title: Optimal Design of Accelerated Testing Plans Considering Maintenance Requirements<br>Author: Haitao Liao, Assistant Professor, Wichita State University, Industrial & Manufacturing Engineering, Wichita, KS, 67260, United States, haitao.liao@wichita.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Murad Hamada<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Accelerated life tesing (ALT) is usually conducted to predict the reliability of a product and optimize the maintenance activity. In many cases, however, mainenance requirements have been given in advance by some mandatory regulations. In this paper, the maintenance-oriented optimal design of ALT plans is presented. The goal of this research is to provide a new set of optimal testing plans under a variety of maintenance requirements.
