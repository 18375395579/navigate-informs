<br>Title: Integrating Univariate Control Charts and Mahalanobis Distance for Near Zero TypeII Error Monitoring</br><br>Author: Weihong Guo, Ph.D Pre-Candidate, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, IOE Building, ANN ARBOR, MI, 48105, United States of America, graceguo@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin, Tae Hyung Kim, Jack Hu, Mike Wincek, Hui Wang, Chenhui Shao, Patrick Spicer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: It is highly needed to ensure high product quality through online sensing monitoring for emerging manufacturing processes especially in producing mission-critical parts such as rechargeable batteries for electrical vehicles. This research proposed an integrated monitoring scheme that targets at a near zero Type II error rate by integrating univariate control charts and Mahalanobis distance. The detailed algorithms and its implementation in a real-world example will be presented.</br>
