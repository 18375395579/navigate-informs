<br>Title: Integer Programming for Cyclic Railway Timetabling and Routing on a Single Track Unidirectional Line</br><br>Author: Matthew Petering, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, 3200 North Cramer St., EMS E367, Milwaukee, WI, 53211, United States of America, mattpete@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mojtaba Heydar, Dietrich Bergmann</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a MILP model for cyclic train timetabling and routing along a single track, unidirectional railway line. The MILP model can handle (1) more than one siding per station, (2) more than two train types, and (3) different origins and destinations for each train type. Several heuristic and exact methods are employed in preliminary phases to set up the model, allowing CPLEX 12.4 to find optimal solutions to hundreds of large problem instances in a surprisingly short time.</br>
