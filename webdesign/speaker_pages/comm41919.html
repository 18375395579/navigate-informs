Title: Strategic Intermodal Planning to Support a Low Emission Transportation System<br>Author: Megan Smirti, Graduate Student Researcher, UC Berkeley, 109 McLaughlin Hall, Institute of Transportation Studies, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1720, United States of America, msmirti@berkeley.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This study will evaluate the impact of a large-scale Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction mandate for the transportation system. Policy scenarios fuel both the introduction of low emission technologies and the distribution of passengers among transportation modes to minimize GHG emissions. The ability of the system to meet a mandated GHG reduction target will be evaluated along with policies and incentives to support a low emission transportation system.
