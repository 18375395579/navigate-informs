Title: Robust Network Design for Multispecies Conservation<br>Author: Bistra Dilkina, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, bistra@cs.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ronan Le Bras, Yexiang Xue, Carla Gomes<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Ideally conservation plans should ensure the connectivity of habitat areas is robust to changes in the landscape. We introduce the Shortest Maximally Connected Network Design problem, which captures the need to both protect multiple edge-disjoint paths as well as minimize the species-specific resistance length of such paths, and provide solution approaches. Our models extend to multispecies conservation, providing a tool to systematically study tradeoffs between species, in addition to costs.
