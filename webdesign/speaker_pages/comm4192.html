We introduce the Shortest Maximally Connected Network Design problem, which captures the need to both protect multiple edge-disjoint paths as well as minimize the species-specific resistance length of such paths, and provide solution approaches. Our models extend to multispecies conservation, providing a tool to systematically study tradeoffs between species, in addition to costs.</br>
