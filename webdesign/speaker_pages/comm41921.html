Title: Coordinated Inventory Allocation-Facility Location Problem<br>Author: Divya Mangotra, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Campus Box 0205, Atlanta, GA, 30022, United States, divya@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jye-Chyi (JC) Lu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We propose a two-phase approximation method for solving a multi-echelon inventory coordination-facility location problem. Our model integrates facility, inventory and transportation costs with service levels and supply-demand variability. We present a numerical study and compare results for the coordinated and uncoordinated model. These results are generated for two cases - identical and non-identical retailers.
