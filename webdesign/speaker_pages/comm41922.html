Essentially, the space of random returns is partition into positive and negative half-spaces, which map directly into profit and loss respectively in the portfolio outcomes. Using the statics information on these two half-spaces, we introduce a so-called partitioned VaR measure, in which minimizing the risk measure is a tractable problem in the form of SOCP.</br>
