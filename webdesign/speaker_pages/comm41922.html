Title: Portfolio Value-at-risk Optimization Using Partitioned Statistics<br>Author: Melvyn Sim, Professor, NUS Business School, Singapore, dscsimm@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Kian-Guan Lim<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present an approach for minimizing portfolio VaR that takes into consideration asymmetries in the distributions of asset returns. Essentially, the space of random returns is partition into positive and negative half-spaces, which map directly into profit and loss respectively in the portfolio outcomes. Using the statics information on these two half-spaces, we introduce a so-called partitioned VaR measure, in which minimizing the risk measure is a tractable problem in the form of SOCP.
