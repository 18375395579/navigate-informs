Title: Fleet Composition of Commercial Jet Aircraft 1952-2005: Developments in Uniformity and Scale<br>Author: Jani Kilpi, Manager, ERP Support, Finnair, Hernemäentie 16, Tuusula, 04330, Finland, jani.kilpi@kolumbus.fi<br>Coauthor(s): Ari P.J. Vepsäläinen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The fleet composition of an airline is an important cost driver affecting its operational performance. The fleet composition is characterised here using a fleet uniformity index and a structured way of measuring fleet scale. The history of all jet aircraft operated by commercial passenger or cargo airlines world-wide is analysed for this study, with the results showing that the uniformity of the airline fleets has been steadily decreasing, while their scale has been steadily increasing.
