The fleet composition is characterised here using a fleet uniformity index and a structured way of measuring fleet scale. The history of all jet aircraft operated by commercial passenger or cargo airlines world-wide is analysed for this study, with the results showing that the uniformity of the airline fleets has been steadily decreasing, while their scale has been steadily increasing.</br>
