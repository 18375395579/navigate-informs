Title: Reactivity Models to Analyze Online Auction Dynamics<br>Author: Wager Miera, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Av. Antônio Carlos 6627 - Prédio do ICEx, Minas Gerais, Brazil, meira@dcc.ufmg.br<br>Coauthor(s): Paulo Goes, Adriana Pereira<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We introduce the concept of reactivity to analyze the dynamic behavior of online auction participants. We then develop two constructs to assess reactivity levels: the entropy of the auction and the outbid-by graph. Advanced techniques for time series and graph mining are discussed to detect dynamic behavior patterns.
