I establish a parametric analysis for the model. Then, I prove the impacts of number of products and degree of risk aversion to the problem in independent demand case. For dependent demands, I conduct a special case analysis to obtain a closed-form solution. A numerical study confirms my analytical results to show how risk aversion and dependent demands jointly affect to the optimal solution.</br>
