However, the sink node is ultimately interested in a function of the measured values, such as maximum, minimum, etc. To efficiently perform this under stochastic conditions, we seek a set of spanning trees to route the sensed information. We model the flow of information as a fork-join queueing network. We obtain bounds on the performance, and thereby select ideal set of spanning trees.</br>
