Title: A Stochastic Network with Concurrent Resources: Heavy Traffic Limit Under Multiple Bottlenecks<br>Author: Hengqing Ye, Dept of Logistics, Faculty of Business, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China, lgtyehq@inet.polyu.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): David D. Yao<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a stochastic network where the resources (service capacities) are controlled by a utility maximizing scheme. We establish a heavy traffic (HT) theorem for such a network when there are multiple bottlenecks and the resource pooling condition does not hold.
