The deterioration (fatigue) of the server and the job processing times are functions of the sequence of jobs that have been processed by the server. We focus on the simultaneous effects of sequencing jobs and scheduling start times by considering the overtime cost. We create a set of test problems and provide a computational procedure that evaluates the optimal job schedules.</br>
