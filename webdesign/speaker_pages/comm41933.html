Title: Fluid Limits for Multiclass Many-server Queues with Reneging under Global FCFS Discipline<br>Author: Weining Kang, University of Maryland at Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, United States of America, wkang@umbc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guodong Pang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a multiclass many-server queueing system, where customers from different classes are served according to a global first-come-first-serve discipline and will abandon from their queues when their patience times are reached. We establish the fluid limit for such a system under some mild assumptions on the general service and patience time distributions.
