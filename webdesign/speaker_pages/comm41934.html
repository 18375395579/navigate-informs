Title: Network Location with Uniform Pricing<br>Author: Dmitry Krass, Professor, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, krass@rotman.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Aboolian, Oded Berman<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We analyze the integrated location/pricing problem for a set of retail facilities on a network. All new facilities are assumed to charge the same price.  Pre-existing competitive facilities may be present. Both the number and locations for the new facilities must be determined. We show that optimal pricing and location decisions can be separated, and pricing discretized, leading to efficient solutions.
