Title: On a Least Absolute Deviations Estimator of a Convex Function<br>Author: Eunji Lim, Assistant Professor, University of Miami, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, United States of America, lim@miami.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yao Luo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: When estimating a performance measure of a complex system from noisy data over a domain of interest, the underlying function is often known to have a certain shape characteristic such as convexity. We propose a computationally efficient way of fitting a convex function by minimizing the sum of least absolute deviations. We present numerical examples to illustrate the performance of the proposed estimator. We also establish the consistency of the proposed estimator and its derivative.
