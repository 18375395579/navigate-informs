Title: Degree-bounded Vertex Partitions<br>Author: John Arellano, Rice University, 6100 Main St., Houston, TX, 77005-182, United States of America, jda2@rice.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Illya Hicks, Benjamin McClosky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper studies degree-bounded vertex partitions, derives analogues for well-known results on the chromatic number, and presents two algorithms for constructing degree-bounded vertex partitions. The first algorithm minimizes the number of partition classes. The second algorithm minimizes a weighted sum of the partition classes, where the weight of a partition class depends on the level of adjacency among its vertices.
