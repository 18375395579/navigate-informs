Title: The Vehicle Scheduling Problem with Electric Vehicles<br>Author: Jonathan Adler, Arizona State University, 699 S. Mill Ave., Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, jonadler@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pitu Mirchandani<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Vehicle Scheduling Problem (VSP) consists of assigning a fleet of vehicles to travel a certain set of trips with given start and end times. VSP changes when the fleet is composed of electric vehicles, since the vehicles can only travel a limited distance before needing to recharge or exchange batteries. In this talk we will define and formulate the problem of using electric vehicles in these scheduling settings, show the problem is NP-hard, and present a heuristic solution.
