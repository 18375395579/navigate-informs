<br>Title: Modeling the Effects of a Transportation Security Incident upon the Marine Transportation System</br><br>Author: David Kelton, Professor, University of Cincinnati, Department of Quant. Analysis & Ops. Mgmt., Cincinnati, OH, 45221-0139, United States of America, david.kelton@uc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Pidgeon, Gerald Brown, Jeff Kline</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We simulate US west-coast container ports with an eye toward the effect of incapacitation or degradation of one or several ports.  If a ship's destination port is down, the shipper's economic self interest determines an alternate port.  We include container unloading, storage, and landside transport to one-digit ZIP codes.  Outputs include demurrage, time delays, and utilizations.  Several transportation security incidents are modeled and their effects are measured.</br>
