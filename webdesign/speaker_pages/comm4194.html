Title: Dispersion of Group Judgments<br>Author: Luis Vargas, Professor, University of Pittsburgh, 314 Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States, lgvargas@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Saaty<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: To achieve a decision with which the group is satisfied, the group members must accept the judgments, and ultimately the priorities. This requires that (a) The judgments be homogeneous, and (b) The priorities of the individual group members be compatible with the group priorities.  In this paper we study the homogeneity of group preference for a single paired comparison (monogeneity) and the impact it has on group priorities.
