Title: Cost-recovering Bayesian Algorithmic Mechanism Design<br>Author: Balasubramanian Sivan, PhD Student, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1210 W Dayton St., Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, balu2901@cs.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hu Fu, Brendan Lucier, Vasilis Syrgkanis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Consider a group of participants competing to receive service from a mechanism that can provide such services at a cost. The mechanism aims to serve agents to maximize social efficiency, without suffering an expected loss: the agents' payments should cover the service cost in expectation. We develop a general method for converting arbitrary approximation algorithms for the underlying optimization problem into Bayesian incentive compatible mechanisms that are cost-recovering in expectation.
