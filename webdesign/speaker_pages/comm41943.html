Title: Limit Order Queue with Heterogeneous Traders<br>Author: Arseniy Kukanov, Columbia University, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, ak2870@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Costis Maglaras<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In financial markets, heterogeneous agents trade in an order book, which can be modeled as a queueing system. Empirical data shows exceptionally long waiting times for orders in large queues and anomalous bursts of cancelations from small queues. To describe this behavior we develop a multiclass model for an order queue at the best bid (ask) of an exchange. Our model can explain empirical waiting time observations and it sheds light on the composition of limit order queues.
