Title: Scheduling Truckload Shipments with Customer Flexibility<br>Author: Jonathan Turner, IEMS at Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL, 60201, United States of America, jonathan@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Soonhui Lee, Karen Smilowitz, Mark Daskin, Tito Homem-de-Mello<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A small trucking firm wishes to maintain its delivery rate while reducing its fleet size. While existing scheduling techniques can achieve some of the desired results, we demonstrate that shifting delivery times can achieve even more. To receive a load at an hour different than initially requested customers will require an incentive. Our model schedules delivery of certain and uncertain demand and reduces fleet size while minimizing needed incentives.
