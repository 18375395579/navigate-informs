While existing scheduling techniques can achieve some of the desired results, we demonstrate that shifting delivery times can achieve even more. To receive a load at an hour different than initially requested customers will require an incentive. Our model schedules delivery of certain and uncertain demand and reduces fleet size while minimizing needed incentives.</br>
