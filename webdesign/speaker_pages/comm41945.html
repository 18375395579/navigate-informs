<br>Title: Grid Computing as an Exchange Economy</br><br>Author: Giri Tayi, Professor, SUNY Albany, 1400 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY, United States of America, GTayi@uamail.albany.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gireesh Shrimali</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider grid computing as a pure exchange economy, using a finite discrete model that captures interaction among agents over time. We then derive some necessary conditions based on the requirements of individual agents. We finally establish, if these necessary conditions are met, the existence of an exchange economy as a competitive equilibrium, when the agents' utility functions satisfy some minimal requirements.</br>
