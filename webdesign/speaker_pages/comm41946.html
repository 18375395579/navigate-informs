<br>Title: Level Workforce Schedules for 2-Stage Transfer Lines</br><br>Author: George Vairaktarakis, Associate Professor, Case Western Reserve University, Weatherhead School of Management, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, gxv5@case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Szmerekovsky</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We define two different workforce leveling objectives for transfer lines - maximin workforce size and range - which seek schedules that minimize workforce size fluctuations from cycle to cycle. For maximin size we develop a  polynomial algorithm. The range problem is NP-complete. We develop a very fast optimal alg by finding Hamiltonian cycles in bipartite graphs. We show that range schedules minimize size fluctuations with minor increase in the workforce size.</br>
