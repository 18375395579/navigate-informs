Title: Efficiency Analysis for Service Industries with Nonlinear Demand and Congestion Effects<br>Author: Wei Sun, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, sunwei@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This work focuses on efficiency analysis of an asymmetric oligopoly with nonlinear demand and nonlinear congestion cost. We derive tight upper and lower bounds on the welfare loss of an oligopoly with respect to its social optimum. We show that the loss depends on the nonlinearity of the demand and cost functions. In addition, it depends on whether one’s congestion cost could be influenced by others?output level.
