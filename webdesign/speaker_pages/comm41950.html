Title: A Newsvendor Model with Endogenized Demand and Search Costs<br>Author: Kwan Eng Wee, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, LKC School of Business, 50 Stamford Road #04-01, 178899, Singapore, kewee@smu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Petruzzi, Maqbool Dada<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper we consider a newsvendor problem with inventory-dependent demand.  Demand depends on the inventory decision because it is costly to look for the goods so the likelihood of its availability must be taken into account.  A modeling framework is introduced and the resulting control problem is shown to reduce to an optimization problem in one variable.  We also develop technical conditions under which the profit function is unimodal.
