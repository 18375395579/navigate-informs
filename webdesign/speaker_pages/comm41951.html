The genetic algorithm (GA) seems a natural tool for solving such a problem. In this talk, I will first demonstrate that the GA is actually not terribly effective for such a purpose. I will then propose a simple “twist.?The idea is to run a number of GAs in parallel without allowing each GA to fully converge, and to consolidate the information from the individual GAs in the end.</br>
