Title: Planning Uncertain Projects Under the Threat of Disruptive Events<br>Author: Gary Mitchell, Associate Professor, University of Portland, Pamplin School of Business, Portland, OR, 97203, United States of America, mitchelg@up.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Klastorin, Issariya Sirichakwal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a project defined by a series of stages where the duration of each stage is determined by the level of allocated resources and random work content described by some distribution. There exists the threat of multiple disruptions; each will stop the project for some random time.   We define a model that allocates resources over time to minimize expected total costs (defined by resource costs, overhead/indirect costs, and penalty costs).  Optimal policies and implications are discussed.
