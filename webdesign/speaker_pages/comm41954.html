<br>Title: Rational Swarm Routing for Military Networks</br><br>Author: Chenyang Li, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Virginia, Dept. of Systems & Information Engr., 151 Engineer's Way, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States, cl2ha@Virginia.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fernan Pedraza, Alfredo Garcia</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Military networks require quick-response dynamic routing schemes for adequate performance. Unlike most MANET protocols that barely respond to link quality change after a path is established, a novel Rational Swarm Routing algorithm that can deal with highly dynamic topology and link quality changes in military networks is presented. Performances comparison with the existing Ant Colony algorithm obtained from a preliminary MATLAB simulation test bed are very encouraging.</br>
