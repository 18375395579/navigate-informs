The customer balks or joins. Even if he takes a ticket, he may abandon later, an event unbeknownst to the server until service would have begun. We use limit theory to compare ticket and standard queues, proving the two processes converge together to the same limit. We conclude that for balanced systems with patient customers, the approaches are relatively identical.</br>
