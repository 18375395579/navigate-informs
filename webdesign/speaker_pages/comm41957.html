Title: Optimal Control of Assembly Systems with Multiple Stages and Multiple Demand Classes<br>Author: Saif Benjaafar, Professor & Director, Division of Indusrial & Systems Engineering, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Sreet SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55419, United States, saif@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mohsen Elhafsi, Weihua Zhou, Chung-Yee Lee<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the optimal production and inventory control in a multi-stage assembly system with multiple demand classes. Each assembly stage consists of a production facility with finite production rate. Demand classes differ in their demand rates and their shortage costs. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and characterize the structure of an optimal policy.
