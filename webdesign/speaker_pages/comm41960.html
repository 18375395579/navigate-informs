Title: Connectivity Measures for Internet Topologies on the Level<br>Author: Frits Spieksma, Professor, KULeuven, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, 3000, Belgium, frits.spieksma@econ.kuleuven.be<br>Coauthor(s): Linda Moonen, Thomas Erlebach, Danica Vukadinovic<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Classical measures of connectivity are the number of disjoint paths, and the size of a minimum cut. We adapt these classical measures to the so-called valley-free path model which is relevant for the Internet on the level of Autonomous Systems. We describe and report on exact algorithms for these measures.
