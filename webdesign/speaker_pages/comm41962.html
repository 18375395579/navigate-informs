Glynn</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a single product periodic review inventory with lost sales with unrecorded pilferage and/or spoilage. As a consequence, the actual and the recorded inventory levels might disagree, but managerial decisions, such as ordering products or performing inventory counts, must be made based solely on the recorded inventory level. We present a model which reduces the problem of finding the optimal counting/ordering policy to that of solving a two-dimensional MDP with perfect information.</br>
