Title: Forecasting and Dynamic Adjustments of  Staffing Level  in Operating Rooms<br>Author: Su Xie, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business Knight Way, Stanford, 94305, United States of America, xiesu@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider strategy that allows managers to review and adjust staffing levels on a weekly basis as information accumulates. We use dynamic programming to formulate the problem of setting the optimal staffing strategy that minimizes total staffing costs. Numerical analysis suggests that the ability to adjust staffing levels dynamically in response to information about the types of cases can lead to a reduction of up to 20% in total expected operating room labor costs.
