Title: Striving for Operational Availability: Investing in Reliability or Maintenance Logistics?<br>Author: Nhi Mai, Texas State University, 601 University Drive, San Marcos, TX, 78666, United States of America, nm1178@txstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rana Dawud, Jett Piechota, Tongdan Jin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Performance-based contracting aims to lower the asset ownership cost while ensuring the equipment operational availability goal. We present a multi-echelon, multi-item logistics supply chain solution that jointly optimizes the system reliability, spares stock level, and repair turn-around times. We further argue that the system operational availability can be warranted under a zero spares inventory policy provided the reliability is designed into early product phase.
