Mudd Building, 500 W. 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, xh2140@columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Starting from the requirement that risk measures of financial portfolios should be based on their losses, not their gains, we define the notion of loss-based risk measure and study the properties of this class of risk measures. We characterize convex loss-based risk measures by a representation theorem and give examples of such risk measures. We then discuss the statistical robustness of the risk estimators associated a family of loss-based risk measures.</br>
