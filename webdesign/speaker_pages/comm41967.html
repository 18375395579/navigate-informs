Title: On Service Capacity Pooling and Cost Allocation Among Independent Forms<br>Author: Saif Benjaafar, Professor & Division Director, University of Minnesota, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, saif@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yigal Gerchak, Yimin Yu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We analyze the benefit of capacity pooling for a set of independent firms. Firms decide jointly on capacity level for the shared facility to minimize capacity investment and delay costs subject to service level requirements. Firms also decide on how costs are allocated. We identify conditions under which firms prefer a grand coalition to any other facility sharing arrangement. We also describe settings when this is not the case.
