<br>Title: Set Solvers Revisited</br><br>Author: Carmen Gervet, Brown University, Box 1910, Providence, RI, 02912, United States, cgervet@cs.brown.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pascal Van Hentenryck</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The language of sets naturally models combinatorial designs. Our findings show that by designing set solvers in analogy with Finite Domain solvers, we can strengthen propagation effectively. A set domain is now totally ordered by length-lex ordering that directly encodes cardinality and lexicographic information essential in set problems. The solver enforces bound-consistency on all unary constraints in time O(k log k), where k is the set cardinality. The approach can be applied to multisets.</br>
