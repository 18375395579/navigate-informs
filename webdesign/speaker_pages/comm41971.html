Title: Capacity Expansion in an Electrical System with Intermittent and Weather-dependent Generation<br>Author: Phil Bishop, Senior Economist, Electricity Authority, P.O. Box 10041, Wellington, 6143, New Zealand, phil.bishop@ea.govt.nz<br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The electricity system in NZ is dominated by generating plant based on highly variable hydrological resources yet conditions currently favor investment in geothermal and intermittent plant. Capacity expansion in this setting entails challenges for the efficient and reliable operation of the system and imposes costs beyond those incurred by the generation investor. A capacity expansion model with a detailed treatment of firming requirements is described and simulation results are presented.
