Norman, PhD, University of Pittsburgh, 1033 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, banorman@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alice Smith, Chen Li</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This talk considers detailed layout design and optimization for retail stores. Given initial aisle settings and preliminary department assignments, we redesign the aisle structure including  constructing additional aisles, changing aisle widths, and locating the departments in each sub-area of the facility with adjusted sizes to maximize the overall profit. We utilize a concave linear piecewise profit per unit area function rather than a constant one for all departments in the retail area.</br>
