The customer can now choose between two options: join this queue, or buy information about the length of the other queue and then join the shorter line.   The model has a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium strategy, and it is characterized by cascades. These cascades reflect a behavior in which the actions of other customers serve as signals for the present customer.</br>
