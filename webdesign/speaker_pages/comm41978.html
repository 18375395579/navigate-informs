Title: Spatiotemporal Change Detection Methods in Non-homogeneous Change Size<br>Author: Sung Won Han, Fellow, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 340 Kingsland St., Nutley, NJ, United States of America, sung_won.han@roche.com<br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim, Kyu Jong Lee, Hua Zhong<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In the classical change point detection problem, the change pattern is homogeneous over time and space, and the change size is sustained after the change. However, in practical spatotemporal health care surveillance, the underlying assumptions of problems are more complicated. Change size can be various over space, so the change size can be large at the center of outbreak but small at the edge. We investigate the existing methods to see how they perform under the complex cases.
