<br>Title: Investigating Cycles in Metabolic Networks</br><br>Author: Tim Nunamaker, Trinity University, 1 Trinity Pl 1818, San Antonio, TX, United States of America, Timothy.Nunamaker@Trinity.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We construct a metabolic network for E. coli and interpret the behavior of cycles within the network. A graph is constructed by connecting all pairs of reactions in which the first reaction produces a resource and the second reaction consumes it.    A cycle is a subgraph in which a closed path can be identified, allowing amy reaction to process a finite quantity of resources infinitely many times. We attempt to classify cycles according to unique characteristics and trends.</br>
