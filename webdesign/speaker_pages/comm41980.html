The method consists of counting the number of samples in which zero defectives or zero defects per unit occur and signaling an increase in quality if k in a row or 2 in t samples have zero counts of defectives or  zero defects per unit.  This method enjoys some similarities to the very popular Shewhart control chart.</br>
