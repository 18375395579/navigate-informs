<br>Title: Shadow Prices in Territory Division</br><br>Author: John Carlsson, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St SE, Office 130C, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, jgc@umn.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a geographic optimization problem in which we are given a geographic region, a probability density function defined on that region, and a collection of utility density functions defined on the region. Our objective is to divide the region into sub-regions so as to “balance?the overall utilities on the regions.  Using a simple complementary slackness argument, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal boundaries between sub-regions.</br>
