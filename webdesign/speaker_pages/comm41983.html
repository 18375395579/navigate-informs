<br>Title: A Robust Dynamic Programming Approach to Buying a Large Block of Security with Adaptive Safe Price</br><br>Author: Ye Lu, MIT, 77 Mass. Ave.  E40-130, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, yelu@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Asu Ozdaglar, David Simchi-Levi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of dynamically trading a security over a finite time horizon. We assume that a trader has a ``safe price for the security, which is the highest price that the trader is willing to pay for this security in each time period. We show that the greedy policy is not always optimal and provide conditions under which the greedy policy is optimal. We also provide bounds on the performance of the greedy policy relative to the performance of the optimal policy.</br>
