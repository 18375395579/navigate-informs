Title: A c\mu Rule for Parallel Servers with Nested Preferences<br>Author: Michael Veatch, Gordon College, 255 Grapevine Rd, Wenham, MA, 01984, United States of America, mike.veatch@gordon.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We establish a c\mu-rule for systems with parallel servers, memoryless service times, linear holding costs and certain c\mu orderings. Multiple job classes arrive and wait in separate queues. Heterogeneous servers each can serve a subset of the classes at different rates. Stochastic coupling sample path arguments are used.
