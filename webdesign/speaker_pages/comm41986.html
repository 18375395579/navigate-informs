<br>Title: Inventory Optimization for a Product with Random Defects</br><br>Author: Jim Shi, Assistant Professor, Georgia State University, 35 Broad Street, Altanta, GA, 30303, United States of America, shigsu@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies single-period and multiple-period inventory optimization of a single product with random defects. The amount of available inventory to satisfy demand is randomly proportional to the total amount of inventory after ordering. We apply dynamic programming to derive and characterize the optimal ordering quantity.</br>
