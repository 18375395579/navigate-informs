Title: A Bayesian Adaptive Control Approach to Robust Parameter Design<br>Author: Arda Vanli, PhD Student, The Pennsylvania State University, 350 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, oav100@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Enrique Del Castillo<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In the dual response approach to RPD, the optimal operating settings are determined based on (static) regression models. These settings, however, may be ineffective in minimizing the process variability if the noise factors have strong autocorrelation or if they are nonstationary.  We propose a Bayesian predictive approach to RPD in which the optimal settings of the controllable factors are adjusted during the operation of the process according to the levels of the response and noise factors.
