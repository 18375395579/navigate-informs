Title: Online Scheduling for Energy Minimization with a Constrained Adversary<br>Author: Tulia Herrera, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, Rm. 313, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, tjh2128@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cliff Stein<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of online scheduling to meet deadlines while minimizing energy in a two power state consumption system with a transition penalty. In general, no online algorithm can minimize energy and meet all deadlines. We propose using a constrained adversary and develop an algorithm that meets all deadlines and has small energy consumption. We bound the competitive ratio of the energy consumption and the total number of idle periods.
