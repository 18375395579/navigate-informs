<br>Title: Average Cost Inventory Models: An Analysis using a Vanishing Discount Approach</br><br>Author: Mahesh Nagarajan, Assistant Professor, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z2, Canada, mahesh.nagarajan@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Woonghee Tim Huh, Ganesh Janakiraman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We characterize, for single stage stochastic inventory models that can be modeled as Markov decision processes with non-compact action spaces and weakly continuous transition probabilities, a set of sufficient conditions under which the optimal policies under the infinite horizon discounted cost criterion converge to the optimal policy under the average cost criterion as the discount factor approaches one. These conditions are relatively easy to verify.</br>
