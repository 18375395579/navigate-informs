Title: Tight Approximations of Dynamic Comonotonic Risk Measures<br>Author: Dan Iancu, Assistant Professor, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, daniancu@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dharmashankar Subramanian, Pu Huang, Marek Petrik<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We compare two frameworks for measuring dynamic risk: (1) involves a static risk measure,and (2) uses a (time-consistent) compositional risk measure.We characterize the tightest multiplicative factor approximation of the former measure by means of the latter.We show that computing the approximation factors is generally NP hard; for the case of CVAR under a uniform measure,we provide analytical expressions for a two-period case, and a polynomial-time algorithm for the general (multi-period) case.
