<br>Title: Tandem Queues with Non-collaborative Flexible Servers and Set-up Costs</br><br>Author: Tugce Isik, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, tugceisik@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir, Hayriye Ayhan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Consider a system of two queueing stations in tandem with a finite intermediate buffer and two flexible servers who are unable to collaborate. Revenue is collected when jobs leave the system, and set-up costs are incurred when servers move between stations. We completely characterize the server assignment policy that maximizes the long-run average profit for arbitrary revenue, set-up cost, and buffer size, and analyze the limiting behavior of the optimal policy as the buffer size increases.</br>
