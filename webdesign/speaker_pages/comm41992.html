<br>Title: OURS: Optimal Unicast Routing Systems in Non-Cooperative Wireless Networks</br><br>Author: Xiang-Yang Li, Associate Professor, Illinois Insitute of Technology, 10 West 31st Street, Chicago, IL, 60616, United States, xli@cs.iit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Wang, WeiZhao Wang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose novel solutions for the problem of routing in a wireless network that consists of selfish terminals. We design a mechanism that results in Nash equilibria rather than the traditional strategyproofness. In addition, we systematically study the \emph{unicast routing system} in which both the relay terminals and the service requestor could be selfish.</br>
