Title: An Efficiency Measure for Dynamic Networks with Application to the Internet and Vulnerability<br>Author: Anna Nagurney, John F.

We provide both continuous time and discrete time versions of the efficiency measure. We illustrate the efficiency measure for the time-dependent Braess paradox and demonstrate how it can be used to assess the most vulnerable nodes and links.
