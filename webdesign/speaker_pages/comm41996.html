Many businesses face the challenge of maintaining inventories that suddenly become obsolete.  These circumstances render traditional inventory analysis unsuitable for balancing reordering costs with the costs of overstocking. We construct a mathematical model of an inventory with simultaneous obsolescence, and a new method for determining its optimal control policy.</br>
