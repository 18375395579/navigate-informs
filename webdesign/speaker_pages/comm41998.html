<br>Title: Discrete Event Sequence Data Monitoring Using Rank Test</br><br>Author: Zhiguo Li, Research Assistant, University of Wisconsin, Madison, College of Engineering, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, zhiguoli@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shiyu Zhou</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Discrete event sequence data has become an important type of data in the service and maintenance. This paper, without any distributional assumption for the event history data, develops a monitoring procedure for the hazard rate of failures using the rank test. Based on the asymptotic properties of the rank statistic, a generic formula for the operating-characteristic of the control chart is derived to show the relationship of the type-I error, type-II error, sample size and hazard rate change.</br>
