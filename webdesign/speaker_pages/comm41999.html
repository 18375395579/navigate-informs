Title: To Fill or Not to Fill: The Gas Station Problem<br>Author: Azarakhsh Malekian, Graduate Student, University of Maryland, Room #1103, A.V.

We consider a more general model that incorporates the actual cost in terms of gas prices and also tank capacity of the vehicle. The objective is to find the cheapest route to go from s to t, or the cheapest tour visiting a given set of locations. For the first problem, we develop a polynomial time algorithm. For most other versions, the problem is NP-complete and we develop approximation algorithms for them.
