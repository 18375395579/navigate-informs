<br>Title: Optimal Design for Complex Toxicology Experiments</br><br>Author: Naha Farhat, PhD Candidate, Virginia Commonwealth University, 2306 Cascade Meadows Drive, Midlothian, VA, 23112, United States of America, farhatnj@vcu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Toxicology experiments often involve multiple responses and multiple predictors from which tolerable dosage limits will be inferred.  An optimal experimental design strategy is presented considering A, E, and D optimal designs as well as weighted and most probable design criteria.</br>
