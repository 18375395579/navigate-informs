Title: Diffusion Model for a Double-ended Queue with Renewal Arrival Processes<br>Author: Xin Liu, University of Minnesota, 207 Church Street SE, 306 Lind Hall, Minneapolis, MN, United States of America, liuxin@ima.umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Qi Gong, Vidyadhar Kulkarni<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a double-ended queue where buyers and sellers arrive to conduct trades. When there is a pair of buyer and seller in the system, they immediately transact a trade and leave.  We assume renewal arrivals and exponential impatience time for both buyers and sellers.   A diffusion approximation is established in a heavy traffic regime, and the invariant measure of the limiting diffusion process, which is an asymmetric O-U process, is studied.
