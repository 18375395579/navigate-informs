<br>Title: Scenario-based Reserve Policies for Transmission-constrained Unit Commitment</br><br>Author: Joshua Lyon, PhD Student, Arizona State University, P.O. Box 875706, Tempe, AZ, United States of America, jdlyon@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Muhong Zhang, Kory Hedman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: On a daily basis, grid operators solve a MIP (unit commitment) that includes a network flow problem (optimal power flow) and reliability standards (N-1). Currently, deterministic reserve policies are used to approximate the standby capacity that is needed to ensure reliable operations. New reserve policies are proposed that efficiently address reserve deliverability on a per-scenario basis without increasing the number of variables and adding only a trivial number of constraints to the problem.</br>
