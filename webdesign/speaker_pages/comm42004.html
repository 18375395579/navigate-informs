<br>Title: Appointment Scheduling with Discrete Random Durations</br><br>Author: Mehmet Begen, PhD Candidate, Sauder School of Business,  University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z2, Canada, mehmet.begen@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maurice Queyranne</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We determine optimal appointment times for a given sequence of jobs (medical procedures) on a single processor (operating room, examination facility), to minimize the expected total underage and overage costs when each job has a random duration given by its discrete probability distribution. A simple condition on the cost rates implies that the objective function is submodular and L-convex. Then there exists an optimal appointment schedule which is integer and can be found in polynomial time.</br>
