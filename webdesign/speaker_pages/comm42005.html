Title: A Simple Expansion Formula for Local Volatility Model<br>Author: Yingda Song, PhD Candidate, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Department of Industrial Engineering, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, ysong@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Ning Cai<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a simple expansion formula for European options  under local volatility model. The expansion series are given explicitly  in terms of Black Scholes greeks. The convergence of the formula is  justified both theoretically and numerically.
