Title: Modeling Nonrecurrent Congestion<br>Author: Melike Baykal-Gursoy, Associate Professor, I&SE Department Rutgers, 96 Frelinghuysen Rd., Piscataway, NJ, 08854-8018, United States of America, gursoy@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhe Duan, Kaan Ozbay<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Multi-server queue with service interruptions is introduced to model the traffic flow subject to incidents. Under incidents, either all lanes or part of a lane is closed. We analyze this system and present a scheme to obtain the stationary number of vehicles. Large capacity links can be approximated as infinite server queues. The effect of recurrent congestion due to excess demand is also incorporated into the flow model. We present simulation results showing the validity of queueing models.
