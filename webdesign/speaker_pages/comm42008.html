The problem assumes that evacuees arrive at a constant rate, and seeks a schedule of pick-ups and the routes for a fleet of buses that minimizes their waiting time at various pick-up locations. In addition, the effect of service level over the waiting time is explored and upper and lower bounds on the fleet size and an upper bound on the number of arc traversals per bus are proposed.
