Title: Perishable Product Transportation with Costly Observation<br>Author: Tae Su Cheong, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, H. Milton Stewart School of  ISyE, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, tcheong3@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chelsea C. White, III<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the value of knowing freight status in the movement from an origin to a destination through intermediate points in the cold-chain logistics. Freight status can be observed at each intermediate point for a cost. At each intermediate point, freight may be returned to the origin, or can continue toward the destination. We model the problem as partially observed MDP.
