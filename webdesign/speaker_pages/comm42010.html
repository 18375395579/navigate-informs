We focus on Single-Source Capacitated MFWP (SSCMFWP). An iterative two-phase heuristic algorithm is put forward. At the phase I, we aim to determine proper locations for facilities, and during the phase II, assignment of customers to these facilities is pursued. The proposed iterative two-phase algorithm produces promising results.</br>
