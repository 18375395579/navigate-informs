Title: Asymptotic Theory of Sequential Change Detection and Identification<br>Author: Kazutoshi Yamazaki, Graduate Student, Princeton University, ORFE Department, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, kyamazak@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell, Savas Dayanik<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Suppose the distribution of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables changes suddenly at some unobservable time to one of finitely many distinct alternatives, then one needs to detect and identify the change at the earliest. We propose a sequential decision strategy that triggers an alarm when the posterior probability of a certain type of change exceeds some threshold, and show its asymptotic optimality under the Bayesian and the fixed-error formulations.
