Title: FIFO versus LIFO Issuing Policies for Stochastic Perishable Inventory Systems<br>Author: David Perry, Professor, University of Haifa, Department of Statistics, Haifa, 31905, Israel, dperry@stat.haifa.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Mahmut Parlar, Wolfgang Stadje<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider an inventory system for perishable items in which the arrival times of the items to be stored and the ones of the demands for those items form independent Poisson processes. The aim of this paper is to compare two issuing policies: FIFO and LIFO. We determine the long-run net average profit as a function of the system parameters under each of the  two policies.
