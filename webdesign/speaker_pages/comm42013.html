Box 11100, Aalto, 00076, Finland, juuso.liesio@aalto.fi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The linear-additive value model (i.e. portfolio value is the sum of additive multiattribute project values) is widely employed to support multiobjective project portfolio selection even though the underlying preference assumptions do not often hold in practice. We relax these assumptions and derive a more general class of multilinear portfolio value functions. Furthermore, we develop techniques to elicit these value functions and algorithms to identify the optimal project portfolio.</br>
