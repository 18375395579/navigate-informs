<br>Title: Bid Price Controls for Network Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Baris Ata, Assistant Professor, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, b-ata@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Akan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a continuous-time model of network revenue management, and construct an epsilon-optimal bid-price control, where the associated bid-price process forms a martingale. The epsilon-optimal bid-price control can be viewed as a perturbation of a bid-price control in the Talluri & van Ryzin (1998) sense. We also show how an epsilon-optimal bid-price control and the corresponding solution to the network revenue management problem can be characterized as a solution to a Forward-Backward SDE.</br>
