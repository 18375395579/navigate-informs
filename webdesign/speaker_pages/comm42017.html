A tunnel function is  constructed at a local minimizer of the objective function such  that it achieves local maximum at the current solution. Moreover,  a local minimizer of the tunnel function leads to a new solution  to the original problem with lower objective value. Iteration  follows in this manner to reach a global minimizer. Promising  computational results are included and discussed.</br>
