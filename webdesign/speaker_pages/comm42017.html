Title: A New Tunnel Function Method for Global Optimization<br>Author: Yong Wang, SAS Institute Inc., 100 SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC, 27513, United States, yong.wang@sas.com<br>Coauthor(s): Lian-Sheng Zhang, Shu-Cherng Fang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We introduce a new tunnel function for finding the global minimum  of a general coercive C1 function. A tunnel function is  constructed at a local minimizer of the objective function such  that it achieves local maximum at the current solution. Moreover,  a local minimizer of the tunnel function leads to a new solution  to the original problem with lower objective value. Iteration  follows in this manner to reach a global minimizer. Promising  computational results are included and discussed.
