Children are considered to be safer when walking together in groups rather than alone. We propose a bi-criteria model in which both the total risk (particularly, the total distance walked alone) and the total distance traveled by children are minimized. We apply the problem to road networks and analyze Pareto optimal solutions which provide a good compromise between safety and distance.
