Title: An Experimental Investigation of Risk-Pooling Effect<br>Author: Tony Haitao Cui, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota, 321 19th Ave South, 3-150 CSOM, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, tcui@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Teck-Hua Ho, Noah Lim<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper experimentally investigates the effect of centralization in inventory ordering decisions.  The results suggest that subjects do not risk-pool in the manner predicted by the classical inventory theory.    We generalize the classical theory to capture the empirical regularities by allowing subjects to form (possibly mistaken) belief about the demand and have reference-dependent preference.
