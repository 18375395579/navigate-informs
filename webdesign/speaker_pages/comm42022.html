Title: Pooling of Spare Parts via Lateral Transshipments<br>Author: Geert-Jan van Houtum, Associate professor, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, PO Box 513, Eindhoven, 5600MB, Netherlands, G.J.v.Houtum@tm.tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Bram Kranenburg<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Spare parts of capital goods have to be at close distance of installed systems in order to realize high uptime percentages. At the same time, pooling of inventories is desired because total demand rates are low for many parts. We show how both requirements can be met via decentralized stockpoints, the use of lateral transshipments, and smart inventory control algorithms. We also show results from a case at a tools supplier in the semiconductor industry.
