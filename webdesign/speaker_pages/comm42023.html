<br>Title: Optimal Serving Schedules for Multiple Queues with Size-independent Service Times</br><br>Author: Yuhang Liu, Graduate Student, University of Minnesota, 1849 Washington Ave S Apt112, Minneapolis, MN, 55454, United States of America, liuxx839@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zizhuo Wang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a service system with two Poisson arrival queues.  A server chooses which queue to serve at each moment. Once a queue is served, all the customers are served within a fixed time. This model is useful in studying airport shuttling or certain online computing systems. We first establish an MDP for this problem and study its structures. We then propose a simple yet optimal state independent policy for this problem which is not only easy to implement, but also performs very well.</br>
