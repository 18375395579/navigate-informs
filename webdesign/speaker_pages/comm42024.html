Title: Transport Equation Models for Transient Production Flows<br>Author: Dieter Armbruster, Professor, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States of America, armbruster@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Wienke<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Transient production flows, like e.g.  recovery from failure, require to determine ensemble averages instead of time averages typical for stationary production.  We  show that coupled transport equation models for describing the time evolution and flow of work in progress and production speed along a production line are an effective way to study transient behavior. It is shown that the boundary conditions are the crucial modeling step  connecting  transient queueing theory and continuum models.
