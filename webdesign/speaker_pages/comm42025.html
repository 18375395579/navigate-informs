<br>Title: Operational Decisions in Inventory Models with Unknown Demand and Unobserved Lost Sales</br><br>Author: Arnab Bisi, Assistant Professor of Management, Purdue University, 403 W. State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, abisi@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Surya Tokdar, Maqbool Dada</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study optimal ordering policies in dynamic inventory problems with censored demand data. We address storable and perishable inventory models over finite horizon as well as perishable model over infinite horizon. For Weibull and exponential demand distributions, we compute the optimal policies and develop managerial insights. The implications of scalability for the censored newsvendor problem is discussed.</br>
