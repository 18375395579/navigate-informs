Title: Robust Inventory Management and Piecewise Linear Optimization<br>Author: Aurelie Thiele, P.C. Rossin Assistant Professor, Lehigh University, 200 W. Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, aut204@lehigh.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate piecewise linear models that arise in inventory management and present robust optimization approaches to incorporate demand uncertainty without the precise knowledge of the underlying demand distributions. We explain why some models may lead to overconservatism and develop techniques to achieve a tradeoff between the number of parameters deviating from their mean and the robustness of the resulting solution.
