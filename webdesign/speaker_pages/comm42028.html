Chou, National University of Singapore, NUS Business School, 15 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore, 119245, Singapore, mabelchou@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): James Ang, Hui-Chih Hung, Qi Yu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a patient scheduling problem for a single class of patients and seek to determine the optimal scheduled interval between patient's appointment time involving a range of patient punctuality distributions. Our objective is to achieve an acceptable trade-off between average patient waiting time and the average makespan of the doctor. We present an analytical model of the problem and obtain a suitable timing policy which presents a near optimal interval between scheduled appointments.
