Due to weather conditions, car accidents, congestion, time and spatial fluctuations of traffic flows can be observed. Minimizing the expected travel time does not account for this. Consequently, the road traffic conditions and its variability can not be ignored in order to carry out a good quality route optimization, represented here as the 95th - percentile of the travel time distribution (lognormal).</br>
