Epelman<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging problem of finding coordinated intersection control policy and routing choices simultaneously in a network with flow-dependent link travel times. We employ the game-theoretic paradigm of fictitious play to iteratively converge to a locally optimal solution. The algorithm can be parallelized to scale to realistic size networks modeled with high-fidelity simulations such as city of Troy, Michigan. Significant savings can be achieved by this approach.
