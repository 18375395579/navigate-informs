<br>Title: A Parallel Algorithm for Dynamic Routing and Intersection Control</br><br>Author: Shih-Fen Cheng, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 80 Stamford Road, 178902, Singapore, sfcheng@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert L Smith, Marina A. Epelman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging problem of finding coordinated intersection control policy and routing choices simultaneously in a network with flow-dependent link travel times. We employ the game-theoretic paradigm of fictitious play to iteratively converge to a locally optimal solution. The algorithm can be parallelized to scale to realistic size networks modeled with high-fidelity simulations such as city of Troy, Michigan. Significant savings can be achieved by this approach.</br>
