<br>Title: Optimal Threshold Probability in Markov Decision Processes with a Target and an Extinction</br><br>Author: Masahiko Sakaguchi, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan, sakaguchi@kochi-u.ac.jp</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We maximize a down-side chance probability of total costs until attaining a target set before hitting a cemetery set in undiscounted Markov decision processes. We formulate the process as infinite horizon case with a recurrent class. We show that an optimal value function is a unique solution to an optimality equation and there exists an stationary optimal policy. Also we give a policy improvement method.</br>
