Title: Facility Reliability with Site-specific Failure Probabilities<br>Author: Lezhou (Roger) Zhan, CitationShares Management, 5 American Ln, Greenwich, CT, 06831, United States, zhan@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Max Shen, Mark Daskin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of locating facilities to minimize the expected   facility, transport, and failure-to-serve costs when candidate locations   have site-specific failure probabilities. Several models are formulated   and solution algorithms are outlined. Computational results are provided   as are insights obtained from exercising the models.
