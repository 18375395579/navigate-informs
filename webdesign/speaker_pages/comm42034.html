Title: Delegate and Conquer: An LP-Based Approximation Algorithm for Minimum Degree MSTs<br>Author: Mohit Singh, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, mohits@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): R Ravi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper, we study the minimum degree MST problem: Given an edge weighted graph G, the objective is to find an MST T such that the maximum degree of any node in T is minimized. We obtain an algorithm which returns an MST of maximum degree at most OPT+k where OPT is the maximum degree of an optimal MST and k is the distinct number of costs in any MST. Our techniques involve a stronger lower bound given by a LP relaxation to the problem and strengthening of the known graph theoretic results.
