Multi-criteria IMRT planning typically involves many objective functions, which leads to a large parameter space to search over. We develop an inverse optimization method to determine convex objective functions and parameters that are most critical in treatment planning. Results show the potential to both streamline the planning process and increase the treatment effectiveness.</br>
