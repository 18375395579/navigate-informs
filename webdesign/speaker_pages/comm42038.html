Title: Electricity Markets for Unpredictable and Uncertain Participants<br>Author: Geoffrey Pritchard, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, Au, New Zealand, g.pritchard@auckland.ac.nz<br>Coauthor(s): Andy Philpott, Golbon Zakeri<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss a stochastic-programming-based method for scheduling electric power generation subject to  uncertainty. Such uncertainty may arise from either imperfect forecasting or moment-to-moment fluctuations,  and on either the supply or the demand side. The method gives a system of locational marginal prices  which reflect the uncertainty, and these may be used in a market settlement scheme in which payment is for energy only.  We can show that this scheme is revenue-adequate in expectation.
