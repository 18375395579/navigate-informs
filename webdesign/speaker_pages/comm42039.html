Title: Optimal Edge Search for an Immobile Hider with Imperfect Detection Probability<br>Author: Shantih Spanton, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, sspanton@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Geunes, J. Cole Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of a single searcher traversing a network to find an immobile hider. The likelihood of finding the hider upon a particular edge decreases with each traversal the searcher makes upon the edge.  Given a finite search time limit the problem maximizes the searcher's probability of finding the hider on the network.
