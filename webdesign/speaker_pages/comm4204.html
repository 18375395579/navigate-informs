Title: A Stochastic Programming Approach for Sector Level Traffic Flow Management<br>Author: Yu-Heng Chang, GaTech ISyE, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, gth795b@mail.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ellis Johnson, Senay Solak, Earl Barnes, John-Paul Clarke<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the single sector traffic flow management problem and develop a solution methodology based on a stochastic programming model. Given the probability distributions for sector capacity, which are calculated by probabilistic weather forecasts, the number of aircraft to send towards a given sector is determined in the first stage. The second stage decisions are the re-routing options for the aircraft according to the capacity of the sector under the realized weather and traffic conditions.
