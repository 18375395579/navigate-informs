The Aviation Weather Routing Tool (AWRT) addresses the complexity of forecasting flight route weather impacts on aircraft by implementing an automated route optimization capability to determine the best route(s) to a target area, loitering waypoints, or desired destination point with the lowest enroute weather hazards risk.</br>
