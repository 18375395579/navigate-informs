<br>Title: Container Vessel Scheduling: Some Solvable Cases</br><br>Author: Lei Lei, Rutgers University, Rutgers Business School, United States, llei@business.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Endre Boros, Selim Bora</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Container vessel scheduling in a supply chain environment is a new but difficult optimization problem because of the additional constraints on suppliers?capability and customer-delivery requirements. We introduce some strongly polynomial time solvable cases encountered in such scheduling processes involving customer receiving time-windows, cargo release times and due dates, and capacitated heterogeneous vessels.</br>
