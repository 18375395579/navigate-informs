<br>Title: Robust Dynamic Portfolio Selection with Learning</br><br>Author: Andrew Lim, Professor, University of California, Berkeley, Department of Industrial Engineering, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, lim@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. George Shanthikumar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of dynamic robust portfolio selection with learning in the framework of relative regret, and provide a Bayesian characterization of the solution. The solution involves a tilted posterior distribution, where the tilting is defined in terms of a likelihood ratio that involves the benchmarks in the definition of the problem.</br>
