Title: Modeling Interactions between Microgrids, Utilities, and Power Markets: A Regulator’s Perspective<br>Author: Venkat Prava, PhD Student, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States of America, vprava1@jhu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ben Hobbs, Chiara LoPrete<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study development of microgrids (MG) in two settings: a regulated vertically integrated utility and a distribution utility/degulated bulk power market.  Cost and technology scenarios are considered for each. For each of setting and scenario we use cooperative game theory to determine whether entry would take place and be consistent with market efficiency. Market failures could block efficient entry, or incent inefficient entry. Regulatory mechanisms to ensure efficient outcomes are analyzed.
