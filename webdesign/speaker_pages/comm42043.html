Cost and technology scenarios are considered for each. For each of setting and scenario we use cooperative game theory to determine whether entry would take place and be consistent with market efficiency. Market failures could block efficient entry, or incent inefficient entry. Regulatory mechanisms to ensure efficient outcomes are analyzed.</br>
