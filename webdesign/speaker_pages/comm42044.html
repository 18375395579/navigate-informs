Title: Energy and Climate Decisions Under Uncertainty: A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis<br>Author: Mort Webster, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, mort@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Morris<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a two-stage stochastic dynamic computable general equilibrium model to explore electricity technology choice under policy uncertainty. We demonstrate the expected welfare-maximizing amount of non-carbon backstop to use in the first stage when the future cap is uncertain. We also explore the impacts of a safety valve and uncertainty in backstop cost on first stage decisions, with tradeoffs between expected penalty for exceeding the cap and expected cost of stranded vintage capital.
