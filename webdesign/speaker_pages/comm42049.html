Title: Using Multiobjective Analysis for Multi-dam Removal Decisions in the Lake Erie Basin<br>Author: Pearl Q. Zheng, PhD Candidate, 313 Ames Hall, Department Geography & Environmental Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD, 21218, pzheng1@jhu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin F. Hobbs, Joseph F. Koonce<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Removal of deteriorating dams on tributaries to Lake Erie involves tradeoffs between ecological benefits and costs.  We develop a mixed integer linear program to select a portfolio of potential dam removals that could achieve the best possible value of a weighted sum of objective(s), while still satisfying the constraints.
