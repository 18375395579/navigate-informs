<br>Title: Fluid Models of Multi-server Queues with Abandonment</br><br>Author: Jiheng Zhang, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 ferst dr, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, jrz@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jim Dai</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study multi-server queues with abandonment. Customers are assumed to have generally distributed service and patience times, which can can be dependent. The dynamics of the system are modeled using measure valued process, keeping track of the residual service and patience times of each customer. Deterministic fluid models are developed to provide first-order approximations for various performance quantities. The approximation yields insights on the impact of the dependency.</br>
