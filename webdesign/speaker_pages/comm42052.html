Title: Serial Multi-Echelon Systems with Economies of Scale via Approximate Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Diego Klabjan, Associate Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1206 West Green Street, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, klabjan@mit.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the serial multi-echelon system with transportation economies of scale. Since optimal policies are not known, we apply approximate dynamic programming to compute policies. We experiment with several value function approximations.
