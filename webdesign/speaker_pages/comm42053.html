<br>Title: On Many Server Queues in Heavy Traffic</br><br>Author: Josh Reed, New York University, Stern School of Business, New York, NY, United States of America, jreed@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anatolii Puhalskii</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We establish heavy traffic limit theorems on convergence in distribution for the G/GI/N queue in the Halfin-Whitt regime. Our results generalize previously known results by allowing for arbitrary initial conditions.</br>
