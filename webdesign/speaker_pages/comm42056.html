Title: Revisit of Stochastic Mesh Method for Pricing American Options<br>Author: Guangwu Liu, Department of Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,, Clear Water Bay,, Hong Kong, China, liugw@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Hong<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We revisit stochastic mesh method for pricing American options, from a conditioning point of view, instead of the importance sampling viewpoint in Broadie and Glasserman (1997). Based on this new viewpoint, we derive new weights which exploit not only the backward but also the forward information. These weights may be fast to implement for some models where the existing weights may not be able to handle because of the huge computational effort required, e.g., the variance-gamma model.
