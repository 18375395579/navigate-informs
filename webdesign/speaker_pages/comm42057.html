Title: Planning Plug-in Electrical Vehicles Recharging Infrastructure in CBD area<br>Author: Yu Nie, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60608, United States of America, y-nie@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mehrnaz Ghamami, Ali Zockaie Kheiraie<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study considers recharging stations in the CBD area. Based on the basic model (available in literature), which considers building and transport costs, a deterministic capacitated model is proposed which considers the inconvenience of unmet demand and switching parking lots, followed by a stochastic model under demand uncertainty. The compatibility of these models with real world situations makes them a great tool for policy makers and charging station companies as this industry grows.
