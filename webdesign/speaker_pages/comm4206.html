Title: Online Network Design with Economies of Scale<br>Author: Adam Meyerson, Professor, University of California, Los Angeles, 4732 Boelter Hall, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States, awm@cs.ucla.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The steiner tree problem where edge costs are concave increasing functions in the demand is considered. Finding a minimum-cost flow in this model has received a great deal of attention and poly-logarithmic approximation results are known. The online variant of these problems, where demand arrives gradually and must be routed upon arrival, is somewhat less studied.  In this talk a poly-logarithmic competitive algorithm for the single commodity variant is presented.
