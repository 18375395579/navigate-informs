Title: Dynamic Cost-Per-Action Mechanisms and Applications to Online Advertising<br>Author: Hamid Nazerzadeh, Stanford University, Terman Eng.

The utility that each agent derives  from consumption of the item is private information to that agent,  and prior to consumption, may be unknown to that agent.  We describe a mechanism based on a sampling-based learning algorithm that under suitable assumptions is asymptotically individually rational, asymptotically Bayesian incentive compatible and asymptotically ex-ante efficient.
