Title: Strategic Forest Management Taking into Account Supply Chain Issues<br>Author: Mathieu Bouchard, Postdoctoral Fellow, Universit?Laval, Mechanical Engineering/FORAC, Pavillon Adrien-Pouliot, bureau 3514, Québec, QC, G1K 7P4,, Canada, mathieu.bouchard@forac.ulaval.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Sophie D'Amours, Alain Martel, Mikael Ronnqvist<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a modeling approach for strategic forest management that takes into account supply chain economic impacts by considering more spatial and market information. This approach is motivated by recent research showing that there is enough flexibility in sustainable harvests to consider both ecological and economic considerations. We also present a road design algorithm to evaluate transportation costs from regions not yet linked to the road infrastructure. Numerical results are presented.
