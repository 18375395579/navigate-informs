<br>Title: Identifying Critical Nodes in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks</br><br>Author: Vladimir Boginski, University of Florida REEF, 1350 N Poquito Road, Shalimar, FL, 32579, United States of America, boginski@reef.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Clayton Commander</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the critical nodes of a network and its potential applications to protein-protein interaction networks. The study presents an innovative approach of applying the recently introduced combinatorial optimization technique to detecting target proteins in protein-protein interaction networks, which has important applications in biology, biomedicine and drug design.</br>
