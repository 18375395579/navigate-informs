<br>Title: Coordinated Scheduling of Customer Orders with Decentralized Machine Locations</br><br>Author: Jinwen Ou, PhD Candidate, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Logistics, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, 03900425r@polyu.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chung-Lun Li</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a scheduling model with two machines at different locations. Each job is composed of two tasks where each task must be processed by a specific machine. The finished tasks are shipped to a distribution center in batches before they are bundled together and delivered to customers. The objective is to minimize the sum of the delivery cost and customers' waiting costs. We develop polynomial-time heuristic algorithms for this problem and analyze their worst-case performance.</br>
