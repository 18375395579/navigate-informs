Dharma Kwon, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1206 South Sixth Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, dhkwon@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Lim<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a class of stopping problems under uncertainty with non-linear utility functions.  We focus on stationary stopping problems and consider stationary stopping policies.  We formulate credible stationary stopping policies, from which the decision-maker will have no incentive to deviate.
