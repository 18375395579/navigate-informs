Title: Inventory Ordering Decisions in a Single Echelon: The Effect of Backorders<br>Author: Jaime Andrés Castañeda, Universit?della Svizzera italiana (USI, Lugano), Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, Lugano, 6904, Switzerland, castanej@usi.ch<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Behavioral work studying ordering decisions in single echelons has focused mainly on the classic Newsvendor problem in which excess demand is lost. In a lab experiment, I test a Newsvendor extension to the case of backorders and compare it to the traditional Newsvendor problem. Main results show that although people continue to underweight backorders in a simple inventory system, they do realize the benefits of an inventory system with backorders, especially for a low-safety stock product.
