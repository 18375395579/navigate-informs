In a lab experiment, I test a Newsvendor extension to the case of backorders and compare it to the traditional Newsvendor problem. Main results show that although people continue to underweight backorders in a simple inventory system, they do realize the benefits of an inventory system with backorders, especially for a low-safety stock product.</br>
