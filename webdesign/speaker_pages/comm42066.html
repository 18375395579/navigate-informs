Title: Integer Programming Models to Manage Hospital’s Blood-products Inventory<br>Author: Grisselle Centeno, Associate Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, ENB118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, gcenteno@usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Serkan Gunpinar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Reducing shortage and wastage is a major challenge in the management of blood products. We present stochastic and deterministic integer programming models to minimize the total cost, shortage and wastage levels at a hospital and explicitly consider age of blood inventory, uncertain demand rates and crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio. Results reflect significant reduction on wastage rates which decreased from 19.9% to 2.57% on average.
