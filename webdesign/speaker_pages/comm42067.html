Title: Comparing AHP and ANP Shiftwork Models: Hierarchy Simplicity V/S Network Connectivity<br>Author: Isabel Spencer, Fulcrum Ingenieria, L.T. Ojeda 0180 Of.1004, Santiago, Chile, isabelspencer@fulcrum.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Claudio Garuti<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The method called Analytic Network Process  (ANP), is a mathematical extension of the AHP method, where the feedback process is allowed, moreover, you can connect any criteria with any other one (even with himself) in different ways. These new groups, called clusters, may have a set of criteria or alternatives (now called nodes) inside. Once the model is built, we continue by entering the judgments or pairwise comparisons of elements with respect to each of the influenced element.
