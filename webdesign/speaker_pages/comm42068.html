The sensors' signature, which is prone to inspection error, enables to classify the system state and decide whether it is reliable, or needs certain preventive maintenance action.    We study the performance of the analytics policy under different inspection and malfunctioning scenarios. We use both Rough Set Theory and Error Correcting Codes measures for this analysis.</br>
