Title: Energy Management of Interconnected Price-Responsive Demands<br>Author: Antonio Conejo, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Department of Electrical Engineering, Campus Universitario, Ciudad Real, 13071, Spain, Antonio.Conejo@uclm.es<br>Coauthor(s): Morteza Rahimiyan, Luis Baringo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a cluster of price-responsive demands. An energy management system coordinates these demands and provides the interface for energy trading between the demands and the suppliers: a renewable source and the main grid. We propose a smart grid robust optimization algorithm that results in maximum expected utility for the demands. The uncertainty of both the production level of the renewable source and the energy price from the main grid is modeled using robust sets.
