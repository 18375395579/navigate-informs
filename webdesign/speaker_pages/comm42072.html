The optimal contract is more steeply-sloped for the largest output levels than that in either the standard moral hazard setting or the standard adverse selection setting. This reflects an important intertemporal effort externality: inducing higher levels of effort after the agent acquires more information also motivates the agent during the earlier periods when the agent has little information.</br>
