Title: Fast-tracking Priority Customers through Queueing Networks with Application to Destination Hospital<br>Author: Jonathan Helm, Assistant Professor, Indiana University, Kelley School of Business, ODT, 1309 East Tenth Street, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, jhelm@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Van Oyen, Thomas Rohleder<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: At a destination hospital, patients travel long distances to receive treatment. For these patients, itinerary completion - defined as the completion of their treatment segment before the weekend ?is an important metric. Motivated by itinerary completion, we present a new methodology for modeling and optimizing flows in a network of outpatient clinic visits to minimize flow times of priority patients within a queueing network with hard deadlines for service completion.
