<br>Title: Approximate Solutions for the Capacity Allocation Problem- Performance and Computation</br><br>Author: Thiam Lee, Columbia University, 500W 120th Street, MC 4704, New York, NY, thl2102@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Woonghee Tim Huh, Retsef Levi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We define a new class of solutions for the airline flight capacity allocation problem with independent demands and non-monotonic demand arrivals, and prove for them performance bounds relative to an  optimal one. We show an algorithm that obtains from demand samples an instance from this class with high probability. Furthermore, the number of samples required to obtain, with a certain  confidence probability, a solution of a desired performance level is polynomial in the parameters.</br>
