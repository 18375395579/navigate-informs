<br>Title: A Dynamic Index Policy for Liver Allocation System</br><br>Author: Fatih Safa Erenay, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States of America, erenay@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Akan, Oguzhan Alagoz, Baris Ata</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a more efficient liver allocation system considering patient preferences, where efficiency is measured by number of wasted organs or total quality adjusted life years. We capture the dynamics of disease evolution by a fluid model, whose solution leads to an intuitive dynamic index policy for assigning livers. We compare the proposed policy with current liver allocation policy by using a simulation model and real data, which shows that our proposed policy outperforms the current one.</br>
