Title: Trajectory-based Vehicle Fuel Consumption/Emissions Estimation using Mobile Sensing Data<br>Author: Zhanbo Sun, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 12 25TH ST, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, sunz2@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuegang Ban<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this research, trajectory-based energy/emissions estimation method is proposed for signalized arterials. Using mobile sensing data, the method constructs the trajectories of the entire traffic population. Macro-scale and micro-scale energy/emission estimations are provided. The results show that adding random noise to the cruise mode and using state-dependent acceleration process lead to better estimations. It is found that the estimations are typically within 15% of the ground truth values.
