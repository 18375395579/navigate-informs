Title: Algorithms for Managing Sector Congestion<br>Author: Robert Hoffman, Principal Analyst, Metron Aviation, 131 Elden St., Fulton, MD, 20759, hoffman@metronaviation.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present automated algorithms for applying air traffic restrictions that prevent sectors of airspace from becoming overloaded, with the focus being more regional than national. Heuristic approaches are compared with classical optimization approaches. Results show that a hybrid algorithm may work best.
