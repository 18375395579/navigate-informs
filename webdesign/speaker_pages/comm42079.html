Title: Dynamic Server Assignment in a Finite-population Queuing System<br>Author: Nilay Tanik Argon, University of North Carolina, Department of Statistics and OR, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, nilay@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chao Deng, Vidyadhar Kulkarni<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the dynamic control of a single server in a finite-population queueing network. We prove that under certain routing structures, the policy that assigns the server to a job that has the shortest remaining service time in some stochastic sense maximizes the long-run average throughput. Our numerical results show that this policy could also be a good heuristic for systems with more general routing structures.
