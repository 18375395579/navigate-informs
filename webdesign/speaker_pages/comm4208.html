Title: A Strategic Model for Healthcare Resource Allocation<br>Author: Eylem Tekin, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial Engineering, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, eylem@iemail.tamu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of service capacity allocation to new patients in multi-physican healthcare facilities. Due to random patient arrivals, the allocation of workloads to physicians may not be always balanced, resulting in long waiting times. Taking into account that some patients would like to switch from their primary physican, we provide insights on the optimal allocation policy with the objective of minimizing long-term average costs.
