Robust planning attempts to reduce the impact of these disruptions. We develop a less conservative robust plan using the concept of recoverable robustness for the tail assignment problem. Simultaneously solving the tail assignment planning and recovery problems to integrate recovery decisions into the original plan. Resulting in a tail assignment that is recoverable with a minimal number of operational changes.</br>
