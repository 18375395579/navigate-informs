Title: The Recoverable Robust Tail Assignment Problem<br>Author: Stephen Maher, University of New South Wales, School of Mathematics and Statistics, Sydney, 2052, Australia, stephen.maher@unsw.edu.au<br>Coauthor(s): Gary Froyland, Cheng-Lung Wu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Disruptions affect airline operations, resulting in increased operational costs. Robust planning attempts to reduce the impact of these disruptions. We develop a less conservative robust plan using the concept of recoverable robustness for the tail assignment problem. Simultaneously solving the tail assignment planning and recovery problems to integrate recovery decisions into the original plan. Resulting in a tail assignment that is recoverable with a minimal number of operational changes.
