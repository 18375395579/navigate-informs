It seeks to collaborate  with other carriers who may share all, part, or none of its network. The  goal of the LTL carrier is to identify the routes that minimize the sum  of the collaborative path costs. A mixed integer formulation is  presented which precludes load splitting between arcs. Issues are  identified, and solutions are presented and discussed on varying network  sizes.</br>
