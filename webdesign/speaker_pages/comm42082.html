Ambulances can be assigned to calls of either priority level, but undesirable allocations are penalized. We formulate this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP); its value function is, in general, neither concave nor submodular. We characterize, under certain conditions, the structure of the optimal policy.</br>
