<br>Title: Liner Shipping Alliances and the Theory of the Core</br><br>Author: Richa Agarwal, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, ragarwal@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Ergun</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Alliance formation among liner shipping carriers is common. Carriers form strategic alliances by pooling their ships and operating them together to gain economies of scale, extend customer base and increase asset utilization. We design a mechanism to allocate benefits, costs and capacity on the ships among the carriers in an alliance . Further we utilize notions from game theory, specifically the notion of the core of a game, to study the fairness of the allocation provided by our mechanism.</br>
