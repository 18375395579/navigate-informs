Title: Traffic Engineering over Hop-constrained Node Survivable Networks<br>Author: Luis Gouveia, CIO and DEIO-FCUL, Edifício C6, Campo Grande, Lisbon, Lx, Portugal, legouveia@fc.ul.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Pedro Patrício, Amaro de Sousa<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We address a traffic engineering problem of routing a new demand matrix R over a dimensioned network, complying with the installed bandwidth on each edge and guaranteeing D node disjoint hop-constrained paths for every commodity. An optimal routing is the one that minimizes i) the average number of hops or ii) the largest number of hops of all paths supporting every commodity.
