In the preparedness phase, we determine the warehouses to be active in the city and their inventory levels by a Stochastic Program to provide fast distribution to hazardous areas. In the response phase, we use the Stochastic Program to prepare a Mixed Integer Program to quickly dispatch the supplies and route vehicles with updated information. We include a case study of two earthquake scenarios in the Seattle area.</br>
