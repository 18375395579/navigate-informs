Title: Parallel Machine Scheduling with S-precedence Constraints<br>Author: Marc Posner, Professor, Ohio State University, Integrated Systems Engineering, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, posner.1@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eun-Seok Kim<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: For s-precedence constraints, a job cannot start processing until all preceding jobs have started. While not discussed in the scheduling literature, S-precedence constraints have wide applicability in real world settings such as FIFO processing systems. We study an identical parallel machine problem where the objective is to minimize the makespan.
