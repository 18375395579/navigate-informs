<br>Title: A Network Support System for Ad-hoc Networks Using Autonomous Intelligence Agents</br><br>Author: Abdulah Konak, Pennsylvania State Berks, Tulpehocken Road, P.O. Box 7009, Reading, PA, 19610, United States of America, auk3@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized approach to maintain the connectivity of a MANET using autonomous, intelligent agents.  Concepts from the social network analysis along with flocking algorithms are utilized to maintain the connectivity of mobile nodes. Computational results are presented to demonstrate the effect of various local agent behaviors on the global network connectivity.</br>
