Title: Heuristic and Metaheuristic Solutions to the Wireless Network Tower Placement Problem<br>Author: Jason Deane, Virginia Tech, 1007 Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States, jdeane1@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Scheibe, Loren Rees, Terry Rakes<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Much of our expansive fiber optic backbone remains unused because of the data capacity bottleneck which exists at the user level. While various technologies have emerged to provide greater end-point capacity, one very promising alternative is high-speed wireless service. While models have been developed to assist in the planning for minimum cost tower placement, these models can be quite large and complex to solve.  This paper explores alternate heuristic and meatheuristic (GA) solution methods.
