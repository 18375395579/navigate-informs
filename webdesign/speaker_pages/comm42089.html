While various technologies have emerged to provide greater end-point capacity, one very promising alternative is high-speed wireless service. While models have been developed to assist in the planning for minimum cost tower placement, these models can be quite large and complex to solve.  This paper explores alternate heuristic and meatheuristic (GA) solution methods.</br>
