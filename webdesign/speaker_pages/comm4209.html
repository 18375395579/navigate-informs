Title: A New Recursive Family of Discrete Power-series Distributions<br>Author: Bill Corley, Professor, The University of Texas at Arlington, IMSE Dept., Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, corley@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A new recursive family of discrete power-series distributions involving the generalized hypergeometric function is proposed. The general probability mass function, mean, variance, and probability generating function are given. New extensions of the Poisson, negative binomial, log-series, uniform, binomial, and hypergeometric distributions with an additional parameter are presented as examples.
