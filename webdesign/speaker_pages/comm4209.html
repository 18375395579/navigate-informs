<br>Title: A New Recursive Family of Discrete Power-series Distributions</br><br>Author: Bill Corley, Professor, The University of Texas at Arlington, IMSE Dept., Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States, corley@uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A new recursive family of discrete power-series distributions involving the generalized hypergeometric function is proposed. The general probability mass function, mean, variance, and probability generating function are given. New extensions of the Poisson, negative binomial, log-series, uniform, binomial, and hypergeometric distributions with an additional parameter are presented as examples.</br>
