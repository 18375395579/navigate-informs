While in some cases, all customers are served according to the order in which they arrive, cutting the line is possible in other systems. We provide conditions under which these intrinsic priorities may emerge. Our results suggest that when priority rules are not centrally managed, they depend on arrival and service rates, customer heterogeneity and patience.</br>
