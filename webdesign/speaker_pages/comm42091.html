<br>Title: Approximation Algorithms for Capacity Expansion Problems</br><br>Author: Huanan Zhang, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, zhanghn@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiuli Chao, Cong Shi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic capacity expansion problem with deterioration. The goal is to coordinate a sequence of expansion decisions to satisfy the demand for services with a minimum expected total maintenance, lost sale and purchasing cost. Given a general structure of demand and deterioration, the computation of optimal policy is usually intractable. We provide a polynomial time algorithm with a constant worst-case bound, and we extend the algorithm to problems with more general structures.</br>
