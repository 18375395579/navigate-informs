Title: The Optimal Shape for a Middle Aisle in a Warehouse with Multiple Pickup & Deposit Points<br>Author: Kevin Gue, Associate Professor, Auburn University, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Auburn, AL, 36830, United States of America, kevin.gue@auburn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Russell Meller, Goran Ivanovic,<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We show how to configure the middle aisle in a unit-load warehouse to minimize expected travel distance when travel can begin or end from many points on one side of the warehouse, as, for example, when doors are arranged to form a shipping dock.  We show that there is a benefit to considering new aisle designs, but the benefit is more modest than in the single point case.
