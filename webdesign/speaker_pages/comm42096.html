Title: Controllability of Complex Networks for Sustainable System Dynamics<br>Author: PaholaThathiana Benavides Gallego, Ph.D Student, University of Illinois at Chicago, 55 West Chestnut Apt3006, Chicago, 60610, United States of America, tati1821@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Urmila Diwekar, Heriberto Cabezas<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we study the sustainability of our planet represented in three dynamic systems. These systems consist on ecosystem models that mimic the dynamic behavior of the Earth.  We determined the minimum numbers of nodes needed to control those systems. In this sense, we argue that controllability of these systems is very important to determining their long term sustainability.
