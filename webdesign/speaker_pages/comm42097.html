Title: Equitable Airport Flight Scheduling Using Airline Costs<br>Author: Maarten Soomer, PhD Student, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR, Amsterdam, Netherlands<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Arrival and departure delays have a large impact on airline operations. There is dependency between arriving and departing flights (crew, aircraft and transfers). We introduce a model to tactically schedule flights on an airport. Airlines provide cost functions related to delays and to represent the dependency between their flights. A scaling method for the costs is introduced to ensure equity. Our formulation will assign landing and take-off times to the flights, while taking costs into account.
