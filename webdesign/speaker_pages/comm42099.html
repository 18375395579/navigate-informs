Title: On the throughput Capacity of Large Ad-hoc Networks Confined to a Fixed Area<br>Author: Eugene Perevalov, Assistant Professor, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Avenue, Mohler Lab, Bethlehem, PA, United States, eup2@Lehigh.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Rick Blum, Danny Safi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: It is known that the throughput of large wireless ad hoc networks with fixed node density decreases roughly as the inverse square root of the total number of nodes, making large networks sound impractical. We study the throughput in the scenario of an ad hoc network occupying a fixed size physical region. It is found that the achievable per node throughput increases at first, reaches a maximum and then decreases demonstrating an existence of an optimal network size.
