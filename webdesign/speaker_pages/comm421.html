Title: Multiple Stopping Problems and Application to Employee Stock Options<br>Author: Tim Leung, siutang@Princeton.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Ronnie Sircar<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many problems in Financial Engineering involve the interaction between stochastic control and multiple stopping; e.g. portfolio optimization with many American options. We study problems of this type in incomplete market settings, and characterize the optimal strategies. As an application, we provide a valuation tool for employee stock options that captures many of their characteristics.
