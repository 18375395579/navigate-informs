<br>Title: Uncapacitated Reliable Facility Location Problem: Formulations,  Algorithms and Heuristics</br><br>Author: Lezhou Roger Zhan, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Univeristy of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, zhan@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zuo-Jun Max Shen, Jiawei Zhang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we analyze the facility location problem under the condition that some facilities are not completely reliable. That is, even if a facility is constructed, it is still subject to fail, which will force its customers to get service from a farther operational  facility or subject to a penalty cost. We propose approximation algorithms for a simple model where the failure probability at each facility is the same. Some preliminary results about a more general model are also discussed.</br>
