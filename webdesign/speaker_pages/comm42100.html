Each supplier provides various parts to the plant, and the parts may have package quantities that satisfy demands for different time horizons. We formulate and solve the problem to find the most beneficial integrated policy of inbound shipping and inventory management when order quantities are restricted to be integral multiples of package quantities.</br>
