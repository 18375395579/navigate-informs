Problems for the Turkish airline companies are different than those faced by the North American and European companies. The Turkish crew scheduling problem has its specific properties such as fixed crew salaries, only one crew base, and other considerations besides cost minimization. We develop heuristic based novel solution methods to address Turkish non-generic crew scheduling problem.
