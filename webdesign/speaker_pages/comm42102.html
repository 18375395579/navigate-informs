Title: Modeling Red and Yellow Alert Durations for Ambulance Systems as Partial Busy Periods<br>Author: Amir Rastpour, School of Business, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G2R6, Canada, rastpour@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Bora Kolfal, Armann Ingolfsson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Ambulance red and yellow alerts are time periods during which all or most ambulances are busy. Modeling such systems as Erlang loss systems, we obtain first moments of alert period duration, showing them to be independent of the shape of the service time distribution.  We study the impact of increasing the number or service speed of ambulances. We show that our results are consistent with empirical data from Calgary. We obtain alert duration Laplace Transforms for GH-distributed service times.
