We approach the problem in a game theoretical setting distinguishing it from risk management problems. By defining it as a special case of Interdependent Security Problem, we show the existence of Nash Equilibrium for both the non-cooperative and the cooperative case between industry and the government. We propose to study different ways to coordinate the actions of supply chain partners with government initiatives.</br>
