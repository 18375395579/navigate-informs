<br>Title: Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process in Robust Ordinal Regression: a New Way of Preference Learning</br><br>Author: Salvatore Greco, Professor, University of Catania, Corso Italia 55, Catania, 95129, Italy, salgreco@unict.it</br><br>Coauthor(s): Salvatore Corrente, Roman Slowinski</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: To learn about preferences of a Decision Maker (DM) in multiple criteria decision problems involving hierarchical criteria, we propose a combination of Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) and a method called Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process. It permits learning of preference relations with respect to a subset of criteria at any level of the hierarchy. ROR takes into account all sets of parameters of an assumed preference model, which are compatible with preference information elicited by a DM.</br>
