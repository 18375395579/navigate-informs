Title: The Benefits of Averaging When Quantile Forecasts Bracket the Truth<br>Author: Casey Lichtendahl, University of Virginia, Darden School of Business, 100 Darden Blvd., P. O.

Winkler, Yael Grushka-Cockayne<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Bracketing explains why averaging point forecasts performs no worse than the average point forecaster.  We extend this notion to probabilistic forecasts.  We assume each forecaster reports multiple quantiles and is evaluated with a linear scoring rule.  We show that if there exists a u such that at least two of the forecasters' u-quantiles bracket the truth, then averaging quantile forecasts performs better than the average quantile forecaster; otherwise, it performs equally well.
