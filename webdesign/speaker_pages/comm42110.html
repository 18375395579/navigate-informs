In this study, aircraft reactive sequencing will be studied and schedule repair algorithms will be developed to deal with flight related disruptions, specifically, arrival of new aircraft, flight cancellations and aircraft delays due to unexpected events such as severe weather conditions, unexpected aircraft or personnel failures.</br>
