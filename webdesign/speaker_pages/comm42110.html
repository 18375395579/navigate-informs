Title: Approximate Algorithms for Aircraft Rescheduling Problems under Operation Disruptions<br>Author: Gulsah Hancerliogullari, PhD Student, Old Dominion University, 5115 Hampton Blvd. Kaufman Hall, Room 249, Norfolk, VA, 23529, United States of America, ghancerl@odu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ghaith Rabadi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Passenger satisfaction is one of the key considerations for airline companies that can be maximized by minimizing the number of cancellations and the total delay. In this study, aircraft reactive sequencing will be studied and schedule repair algorithms will be developed to deal with flight related disruptions, specifically, arrival of new aircraft, flight cancellations and aircraft delays due to unexpected events such as severe weather conditions, unexpected aircraft or personnel failures.
