Title: Emergency Medical Service Facilities Location with Service Level Constraints on Priority Class<br>Author: Sachin Jayaswal, Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Vastrapur, Ahmedabad, Gu, 380015, India, sachin@iimahd.ernet.in<br>Coauthor(s): Navneet Vidryarthi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a location-allocation model for Emergency Medical Service facilities under constraint on the waiting time distribution for each priority patient class. We solve this problem by exploiting the concavity of the waiting time distribution of low priority customers to eliminate its non-linearity at the expense of a large number of tangent hyperplanes, determined numerically using Matrix Geometric Method.
