This is a methodology to identify possible hijack points and routes to vulnerable targets. Probabilities of interception by law enforcement agents depend on the deployment of their resources. Choice of hijack points depends on the location of possible targets and the probabilities of reaching them. Route choice aims to minimizing distance to a target and maximizing consequences if the vehicle is intercepted before reaching the target.
