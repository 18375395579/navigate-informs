The model optimizes the net present value of money available to the bank subject to pricing limits, cash flows. It also considers the demand price (interest rate) relationship and default probability as a function of interest rate.  We then assume that different versions of demand function. We consider when demand function is given by a straight line, an exponential function and by rectangular hyperbola.</br>
