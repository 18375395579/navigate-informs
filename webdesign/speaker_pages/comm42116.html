Title: Improved Methodology for the Construction of Large-Scale Wind Turbine Power Curves<br>Author: Krystel Castillo, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at San Antonio, One Circle UTSA EB 3.04.54, San Antonio, TX, 78249, United States of America, krystel.castillovillar@utsa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jose Francisco Herbert Acero<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study examines methodologies for the construction of power curves considering turbulence intensity corrections, topographic effects, atmospheric stability, icing and fouling, natural degradation of blades, blocking effects and uncertainty. We propose a method to reduce the uncertainty of such curves by considering the concept of equivalent wind speed that improves energy production forecast. A case study is considered to validate the methodology.
