Title: Day-differentiated Load Planning for LTL Carriers<br>Author: Mike Hewitt, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, mhewitt@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Erera, Martin Savelsbergh<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider an extension of the traditional load planning problem faced by LTL carriers, namely the generation of day-of-week differentiated load plans, which are necessary to remain competitive in the current market. We investigate heuristics that utilize exact optimization and present results indicating significant savings for a national carrier.
