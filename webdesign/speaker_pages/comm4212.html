<br>Title: Evaluating and Minimizing Adversarial Risk for Hazardous-materials Shipments</br><br>Author: Kevin Wood, Distinguished Professor, Operations Research Dept., Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, United States of America, kwood@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bradford Foster</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We model repeated shipments of a hazardous material between a set of origins and destinations in a network, and assume a single, worst-case terrorist attack.  “Worst case?implies maximum damage, measured in terms of casualties, property damage, etc.  We build models to minimize expected maximum damage by (a) allocating a limited set of decoy shipments, (b) rerouting, or (c) reducing response time to an attack.  Tests for realistic settings in the U.S. demonstrate practicability.</br>
