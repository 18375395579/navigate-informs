Title: Bi-objective Coverage Models for EMS Facility Location<br>Author: Matthew Saltzman, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, United States of America, mjs@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Van Dyken, P. M. Dearing<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Location problems may involve trade offs between conflicting objectives.  We present algorithms for generating all nondominated outcomes for locating a fixed number of EMS facilities while maximizing coverage of demand points within two different response times and for minimizing the number of facilities while maximizing coverage within a given time.
