M. Dearing</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Location problems may involve trade offs between conflicting objectives.  We present algorithms for generating all nondominated outcomes for locating a fixed number of EMS facilities while maximizing coverage of demand points within two different response times and for minimizing the number of facilities while maximizing coverage within a given time.</br>
