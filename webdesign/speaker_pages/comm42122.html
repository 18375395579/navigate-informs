<br>Title: Detecting Covert Members of Terrorist Networks</br><br>Author: Alice Paul, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, United States of America, apaul@hmc.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Increasing the amount of communication through a key leader increases the likelihood of detection. If we model a covert organization as a social network where edges represent communication between members, we want to determine the subset of members to remove that maximizes the amount of communication through the leader. We present an optimization and its decomposition for this problem. We focus on structural characteristics of vertices and subsets that increase communication.</br>
