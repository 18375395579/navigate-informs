Title: Using a Combination of Forecasts Approach to Resolve Partition-dependence Bias<br>Author: Bob Bordley, General Motors Operations Research, M/C 480-106-256, 30500 Mound Road, Warren, MI, 48090, United States, robert.bordley@gm.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Elicited probabilities vary with partition.  This paper treats each partition's elicited probability as an estimate of the individual's true underlying subjective probability.  Assuming forecast error has a Dirichlet distribution (which reproduces some of known biases toward the uniform prior) leads to a combined estimate of the subjective probability.  This is applied to a real problem in missing survey data.  This Bayesian solution has some Shaferian-aspects.
