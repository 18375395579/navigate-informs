Title: Cost versus Robustness in Layered Infrastructure Networks<br>Author: Kevin Kennedy, Captain, Air Force, 5880 Gross Drive, Dayton, OH, 45431, United States of America, kevin.kennedy@afit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dick Deckro, James Moore<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This presentation outlines a model for layered infrastructure networks that considers the following factors:  cost versus risk in design; and system construction and operations costs versus potential robust systems costs in the face of disruption, either nature or man-made.  This is a parameterized model (using epsilon-constraint multiobjective programming) which considers various budget levels.
