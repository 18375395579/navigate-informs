Title: Self-adjusting Price Control for Network Revenue Management<br>Author: Stefanus Jasin, Assistant Professor, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, sjasin@umich.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We provide a very simple improvement for the well-known static price control of Gallego and Van Ryzin (1997). Our approach requires only linear updating of target sales rate and does NOT require any re-optimization at all. This suffices to improve the O(T^0.5) regret bound of static control to O(log T). For a certain class of problems, we show how to do semi-decentralized control. Finally, we briefly discuss whether it is possible to update the price of only SOME of the products instead of all.
