Title: Optimization-based Frameworks for Dynamic Configuration of Real-time Systems with Energy Constraints<br>Author: Eduardo Camponogara, Professor, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Cx.

Mechanisms to do so must take into consideration not only energy constraints but also schedulability since tasks must execute within predefined time windows. Further, it is desired that application quality of service (QoS) is optimized. This talk presents two optimization-based frameworks for maximizing application QoS subject to both schedulability and energy constraints.
