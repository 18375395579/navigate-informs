Title: Short-Term, Medium-Term, and Reactive Scheduling of an Industrial Batch Plant<br>Author: Christodoulos Floudas, Professor, Princeton University, Department of Chemical Engineering, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, floudas@titan.princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stacy Janak, N. Vormbrock, J. Kallrath<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The medium-term production scheduling of a multipurpose, multiproduct industrial batch plant is modeled using a novel continuous-time mathematical formulation first developed.  The methodology consists of the decomposition of the whole scheduling period into successive short horizons of a few days. Computational studies on short-term, medium-term and reactive scheduling of a large scale industrial batch plant will be presented.
