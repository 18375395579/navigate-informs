Vormbrock, J. Kallrath</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The medium-term production scheduling of a multipurpose, multiproduct industrial batch plant is modeled using a novel continuous-time mathematical formulation first developed.  The methodology consists of the decomposition of the whole scheduling period into successive short horizons of a few days. Computational studies on short-term, medium-term and reactive scheduling of a large scale industrial batch plant will be presented.</br>
