Targets are characterized by their priority level and min/max service levels, and payload capacities of UCAVs and the range have to be respected. A Tabu Search Heuristic is developed to coordinate two problems: A target assignment problem and a vehicle routing problem, which in turn splits into multiple decision TSPs.</br>
