Title: Mechanism Design for Sustainable Alliances Among Sea Carriers<br>Author: Richa Agarwal, PhD Candidate, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, ragarwal@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Özlem Ergun<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In transportation industry, alliances among carriers are an important factor in staying competitive. Though working in close liaisons, carriers are goverened by their own self-interests. We present membership mechanisms, by adopting a rationality based approach using notions from game theory and inverse optimization, to allocate resources and benefits among carriers for forming sustainable alliances.
