Title: Stroke Network Design: A Location-allocation Problem<br>Author: Beste Kucukyazici, Assistant Professor, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, QC, H3A 1G5, Canada, bkucukya@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mozart Menezes<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study focuses on a design problem of stroke networks that represents the potential trade-off between minimizing transportation time to the hospital and increasing congestion in that hospital, in order to offer an optimized infrastructure that maximizes the overall efficiency of the stroke system. The developed model also allows to study: (i) value of relocating the primary stroke hospitals, and (ii) value of online information flow between hospitals and EMS.
