<br>Title: A Time-dependent Study of Markovian Queues with Balking and Reneging</br><br>Author: Brian Fralix, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, Dept. of Mathematical Sciences, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, bfralix@clemson.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the transient behavior of a birth-death process, whose birth and death rates are decreasing and increasing, respectively, with respect to the state index.  Such processes can be used to model Markovian systems where customers are allowed to either balk or renege.  Our results are derived by relating this birth-death process to a special type of queueing system, whose queue-length process is equal in distribution to the original birth-death process.</br>
