Title: Inventory Control in a Build-to-Order Environment<br>Author: Melda Ormeci, School of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, ormecime@isye.gatech.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We look at the challenges and solution strategies of employing build-to-order in the context of global supply. We introduce a new shipping policy, ''Ship-to-Average, which prescribes sending a fixed quantity, based on the long term average forecast, with each shipment and making adjustments only if the inventory strays outside a prescribed range. We provide theoretical support for the observed performance of this type of policy by addressing a Brownian control problem whose objective is to find the right balance between holding costs and the costs for adjusting shipment sizes.
