<br>Title: Image-guided IMRT Planning for Radiation Therapy</br><br>Author: Ronald L. Rardin, White Distinguished Professor, University of Arkansas, Industrial Engineering, Bell 4169, Fayetteville, AR, 72762, United States of America, rrardin@uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seda Gumrukcu, Mark Langer MD</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) treatments involve daily fractions rather than one single session. Plans should be updated and modified after each fraction due to the tumor position and the shape changes, and recent developments in such “Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)?technology are showing promise. In this paper we discuss optimization models that update the plan and find the best IMRT design for both fraction and overall treatment.</br>
