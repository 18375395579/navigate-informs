<br>Title: Allocation of Variable Resources as a System of Systems Problem</br><br>Author: William Crossley, Associate Professor, Purdue University, School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 315 N Grant St, West Lafayette, IN, 47907-2023, United States, crossley@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Muharrem Mane</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study investigates the problem formulation of resource allocation and aircraft design as a System of Systems problem.  The presence of a yet-to-be-designed aircraft in the problem statement makes this problem one of allocation of variable resources.  The resulting statement is a Mixed-Integer, Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem.  The study uses a problem in the context of fractional operations and investigates the impact of a new, yet-to-be-designed aircraft on the fleet operating cost.</br>
