Title: Cumulative Defensive Resource Allocation Among Multiple Targets in the Face of a Strategic Attacker<br>Author: Xiaojun Shan, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, 435 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, xshan@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhuang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study defensive resource allocation in a multi-period multi-target attacker-defender game. At each period, the defender allocates a limited amount of defensive resources over n targets and the attacker chooses one target to attack with some probability. We find that carry-over defense could have a significant effect on optimal allocations. The defender would prefer to defend more targets in the next period.
