Title: Stochastic Root Finding with the Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm<br>Author: Shane Henderson, Cornell University, School of ORIE, 230 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, sgh9@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Frazier, Rolf Waeber<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The probabilistic bisection algorithm finds the root of a monotone function on [0, 1] when noisy function evaluations are available. It successively updates a prior distribution on the location of the root. In doing so, it needs to know the probability that the sign of the noisy function evaluation is correct. We explore a method for circumventing this problem and develop convergence results.
