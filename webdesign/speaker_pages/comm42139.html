<br>Title: Bid-Price Controls for Network Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Mustafa Akan, Ph.D Student, Kellogg School of Management, Managerial Economics & Decision Sciences, Leverone 581, Evanston, IL, 60201, United States, m-akan@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Baris Ata</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a network model of revenue management and propose an optimal bid-price control, where the bid prices form a martingale. We also propose a predictable bid-price control where bid prices used in each period are last updated in the previous period and establish its near optimality as the periods get small while the planning horizon and the other model primitives remain unchanged. Near-optimal bid-prices form a martingale too. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the optimality gap.</br>
