We also propose a predictable bid-price control where bid prices used in each period are last updated in the previous period and establish its near optimality as the periods get small while the planning horizon and the other model primitives remain unchanged. Near-optimal bid-prices form a martingale too. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the optimality gap.
