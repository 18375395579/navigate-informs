<br>Title: Automated Mechanism Design using CAT Games</br><br>Author: Jinzhong Niu, Postdoctoral Research Associate, The City College of New York, 160 Convent Avenue, New York, NY, 10031, United States of America, jniu@ccny.cuny.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Simon Parsons</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm-based approach to automated design of complete auction mechanisms in the domain of CAT games. In a CAT game, multiple players, each providing his/her own design of a double-sided auction, compete against each other to attract traders for more profit and high transaction success rate. We show that this evolutionary method is effective in creating auction mechanisms in the CAT setting.</br>
