First, we show that a vector autoregressive (VAR) model captures daily stock return serial dependence in a statistically significant manner. Second, we show that both arbitrage (zero-cost) portfolios and investment (positive-cost) portfolios that exploit serial dependence in stock returns outperform the traditional portfolios, even in the presence of transaction costs of up to 10 basis points.</br>
