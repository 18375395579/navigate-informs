Title: Staffing and Control of Instant Messaging Contact Centers<br>Author: Jiheng Zhang, HKUST, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, jiheng@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Luo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a new kind of customer contact centers where agents communicate with customers via instant messaging over the Internet rather than phone calls. A distinctive feature is that one agent can serve multiple customers simultaneously. We establish fluid approximations for such systems in the many-server heavy-traffic regime. The fluid limits, which involve a stochastic averaging principle, provide insights into the optimal staffing and control for such service centers.
