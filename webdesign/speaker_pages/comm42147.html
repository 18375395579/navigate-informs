Title: Simple Continuous Approximations for Local-vs-Global Delivery<br>Author: John Carlsson, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St SE, Office 130C, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, jgc@umn.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of designing an optimal hub-and-spoke network in continuous Euclidean space: the “spokes?of the network are distributed uniformly over a service region, and our objective is to determine the optimal hub configuration. We consider seven different backbone network topologies for connecting the hub nodes, namely the Steiner and minimum spanning trees, a TSP tour, a star network, a capacitated vehicle routing tour, a complete bipartite graph, and a complete graph.
