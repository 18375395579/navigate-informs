<br>Title: Benders Cuts for the Single-source Network Loading Problem</br><br>Author: Ivana Ljubic, University of Vienna, Br√ºnnerstr. 72, 1210 Vienna, Austria, Vienna, 1210, Austria, ivana.ljubic@univie.ac.at</br><br>Coauthor(s): Juan Jose Salazar Gonzalez, Peter Putz, Inmaculada Rodriguez Martin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The single source network loading problem asks for installing at most one  module type on each edge of an undirected graph G, so that routing demands from the root  node to a selected set of customers using installed module capacities is possible.  Several ILP formulations are compared, both theoretically and computationally. We show that, by rounding the Benders cuts,  we can significantly improve the  quality of lower bounds. The Benders cuts are separated  within a branch-and-cut framework.</br>
