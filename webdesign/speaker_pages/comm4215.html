Title: Consolidation Policies for the Shipping of Perishable Products<br>Author: Christine Nguyen, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, nguyen7@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Maged Dessouky, Alejandro Toriello<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study an agricultural supply chain where several suppliers consolidate their products to save transportation costs.  In the deterministic case, we compare a one-period look-ahead heuristic against optimal solutions computed from a dynamic program.  We show how the look-ahead policy performs against other simple policies and demonstrate the effectiveness of a cost allocation rule in the stochastic demand environment.
