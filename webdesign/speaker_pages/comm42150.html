Title: Dynamic Model of Urban Freight Flows and Demand Formation<br>Author: Hongcheng Liu, PhD Candidate, Pennsylvania State University, 240 Leonhard, University Park, PA, United States of America, hql5143@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Terry Friesz, Bo Zhang, Tao Yao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper we model congested urban freight transportation for a hypothetical urban street network in a dynamic setting. The model may be described as a dynamic spatial price equilibrium model that views freight transportation demand as derived from the spatial separation of inventories and consumption of an abstract good. We solve a numerical example.
