<br>Title: Production Scheduling with Uncertain Supply:  Example from Mining Orebodies</br><br>Author: Roussos Dimitrakopoulos, Professor, McGill University, Department of Mining Engineering, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, roussos.dimitrakopoulos@mcgill.ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The presentation considers production scheduling under uncertain supply for metal mines. Orebodies mined are uncertain in metal contained; a production schedule must be defined to ensure supply of ore in all production periods so that net present value is maximised. A new framework for mine production scheduling based on stochastic integer programming is outlined along with the concept of supply risk discounting, leading to substantial improvements of net present value of production schedules.</br>
