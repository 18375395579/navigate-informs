<br>Title: A Traffic Assignment Model for A Ridesharing Transportation Market</br><br>Author: Huayu Xu, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Avenue, GER 206, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-0193, United States of America, huayuxu@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fernando Ordonez, Maged Dessouky</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a traffic assignment model that describes the interactive relationships between ridesharing activities and traffic congestions in a new Transportation Market, which is an open market where both drivers and passengers can negotiate the ridesharing service prices. The computational tests show how ridesharing impacts traffic congestion, how to motivate participation in ridesharing, and how congestion influences ridesharing, including the prices and the number of participants.</br>
