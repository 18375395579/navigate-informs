Thus, we ask investors to self-describe as “conservative?or “risky.? In this work we take a novel, data-driven perspective.  Using ideas from inverse optimization, we construct distortion risk measures that are consistent with an investor's historical holdings.  Computational evidence suggests the method is robust to data error and misspecification.
