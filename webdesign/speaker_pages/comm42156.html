Title: Supplier Selection and Order Allocation under Supply Risks and Order Size Constraints<br>Author: Yingying Wang, North Carolina State University, 400 Daniels Hall, College of Engineering, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, yywang1985@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Donald Warsing, Russell E. King, Anita Vila-Parrish, Semra Ahiska<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a single-period, single-item, single-site inventory system with multiple suppliers, some of which are not perfectly reliable (delivery probability less than 1). The suppliers also may exhibit different fixed costs, item costs, and restrictions on minimum and maximum order sizes. Orders are allocated among suppliers to satisfy uncertain demand and minimize total costs. We develop and compare several algorithms to solve the problem under both continuous and discrete demand settings.
