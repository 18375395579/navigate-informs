The suppliers also may exhibit different fixed costs, item costs, and restrictions on minimum and maximum order sizes. Orders are allocated among suppliers to satisfy uncertain demand and minimize total costs. We develop and compare several algorithms to solve the problem under both continuous and discrete demand settings.</br>
