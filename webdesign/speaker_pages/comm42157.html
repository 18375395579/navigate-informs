Title: Tail Probabilities for Infinite Server Queues in Heavy Traffic<br>Author: Hernan Awad, University of Miami, Department of Management Science, Coral Gables, FL, 33124-6544, United States of America, h.awad@miami.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter W. Glynn, Yuqing Sun<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider an infinite server queue in heavy traffic, and derive asymptotic expressions for the tail probabilities of the steady state distribution. In particular, we are interested in the left tail, as it represents the probability of failure in situations where occupancy must remain above a critical threshold for a system to be operational.
