Glynn, Yuqing Sun</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider an infinite server queue in heavy traffic, and derive asymptotic expressions for the tail probabilities of the steady state distribution. In particular, we are interested in the left tail, as it represents the probability of failure in situations where occupancy must remain above a critical threshold for a system to be operational.</br>
