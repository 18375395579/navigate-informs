<br>Title: Logic-based Multi-objective Optimization for Restoration Planning</br><br>Author: Jing Gong, Ph.D Candidate, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th St., Troy, NY, 12180, United States, gongj@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Earl Rusty Lee, John E. Mitchell, William Wallace</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a Benders decomposition approach to schedule the tasks that need to be completed in order to restore services following a major disruption. Efficient solutions for the multiple objective function problem are determined using convex combinations of the three (classical) objectives involved in scheduling problems: cost, tardiness and makespan.</br>
