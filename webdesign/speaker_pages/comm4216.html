Title: Preserving Efficiency in Multiobjective Programming under Uncertainty<br>Author: Margaret Wiecek, Clemson University, Mathematical Sciences, Clemson, United States of America, wmalgor@clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erin Doolittle, Herv?Kerivin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Multiobjective programs with uncertain objective functions are studied. The uncertainty is reflected in the number of objective functions, that can be infinite, and their type that results from operation applied to a subset of essential objective functions. Operations on the essential functions that have no effect on their Pareto set are identified.
