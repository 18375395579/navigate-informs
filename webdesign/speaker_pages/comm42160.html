Title: Information Collection With A Physical State<br>Author: Ilya Ryzhov, Princeton University, Department of ORFE, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, iryzhov@Princeton.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Suppose that we have a graph whose edges have unknown rewards (or costs) that are independent of one another. We use sequential, noisy measurements of the rewards to refine Bayesian estimates of the true, unknown rewards. Our overall objective is to find the path with the highest total reward. The graph structure makes the problem fundamentally different from the well-known bandit problem. We must use the physical state to allocate measurements without enumerating all possible paths.
