We use sequential, noisy measurements of the rewards to refine Bayesian estimates of the true, unknown rewards. Our overall objective is to find the path with the highest total reward. The graph structure makes the problem fundamentally different from the well-known bandit problem. We must use the physical state to allocate measurements without enumerating all possible paths.</br>
