Title: Efficient Employment of Reactive and Non-Reactive Sensors<br>Author: Roberto Szechtman, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Department, Monterey, CA, 93940, United States of America, rszechtm@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Moshe Kress<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider sensors which are subject to false-positive and false-negative errors. The sensors search for threat objects that are located in a certain area of interest, which is divided into a grid of area-cells. An area-cell is said to be “determined?if the searcher can ascertain with a given high probability the presence or absence of at least one object. We develop models, rooted in stochastic approximation theory, that maximize the expected number of determined area-cells.
