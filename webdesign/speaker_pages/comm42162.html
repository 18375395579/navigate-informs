In this paper the optimal location for the future factories are estimated and the optimal value chain; animal production ?butchery ?processing ?warehousing ?distribution are defined. Decisions are based on multiple objectives, such as the consumer expectations, transportation costs and investment and operating costs of the animal production plants.</br>
