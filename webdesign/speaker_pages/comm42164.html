Title: Computational Time Estimation of SDP Solvers<br>Author: Makoto Yamashita, Kanagawa University, 3-27-1 Rokkakubashi Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama, Japan, Makoto.Yamashita@is.kanagawa-u.ac.jp<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: When solving extremely large SemiDefinite Programs (SDPs),  it is favorable to  have some knowledge of computational time in advance.  From some information of input SDP files and its result files  of SDP solvers, we specify parameters to compute estimation time.  We formulate the computational time estimation model into an SDP.  By solving this SDP, we obtain acceptable  estimations of SDPA (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm) and   SDPARA (its parallel version).
