<br>Title: Staffing and Admission Control in an M/M/N+M Queue with an Uncertain Arrival Rate</br><br>Author: Yasar Levent Kocaga, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, Syms School of Business, Yeshiva University, New York, United States of America, kocaga@yu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mor Armony, Amy Ward</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study staffing and admission control for a system with abandonment and with an uncertain arrival rate. The upfront staffing decision is made when the arrival rate is unknown and the admission control decision is made after the arrival rate has been realized once. We propose a policy that uses a square-root staffing rule and admits customers in accordance with a threshold rule and show that our policy is asymptotically optimal.</br>
