Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can operate on gasoline when the battery is depleted. Using longitudinal travel data of 331 vehicles over 18 months in the Seattle metropolitan area, we aim to find the optimal battery capacity and charging facility coverage for PHEVs from the prospective of customers and policymakers, respectively.</br>
