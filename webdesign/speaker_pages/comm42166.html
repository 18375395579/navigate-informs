Title: Assessing Energy Use and Charging Facilities for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles<br>Author: Xing Wu, Assistant Professor, Lamar University, 4400 MLK Parkway, Cherry Engineering RM 2032, Beaumont, TX, 77706, United States of America, xwu1@lamar.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Electrification of transportation is widely regarded as an effective solution to the energy security, global warming and pollutant emissions. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can operate on gasoline when the battery is depleted. Using longitudinal travel data of 331 vehicles over 18 months in the Seattle metropolitan area, we aim to find the optimal battery capacity and charging facility coverage for PHEVs from the prospective of customers and policymakers, respectively.
