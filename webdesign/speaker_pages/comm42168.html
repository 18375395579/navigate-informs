Title: Optimal Equipment Replacement for a Markov Additive Process with Brownian Noise and Jumps<br>Author: Nazanin Esmaili, Ph.D. student, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, 3700 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, nae22@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Maillart, Jeffrey Kharoufeh<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the optimal maintenance of a stochastically degrading system to minimize the total expected discounted cost of preventive and reactive replacements over an infinite planning horizon.  The degradation is modeled as a Markov additive process superimposed with Brownian noise and jumps at known, deterministic intervals.  Using an MDP model, we prove the optimality of a threshold policy for each environment state and show that the discounted cost is non-decreasing in the degradation level
