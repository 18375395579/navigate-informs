<br>Title: A Pickup and Delivery Problem using Crossdocks and Truckload Lane Rates</br><br>Author: Kathleen Lindsey, Georgia Institute of Technology, 1074 Peachtree Walk NE, # B401, Atlanta, GA, 30309, United States of America, kate.abercrombie@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Erera, Martin Savelsbergh</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A path-based integer programming model is presented for a shipper pickup and delivery planning problem to move freight from origins to destinations. Each shipment is moved either direct via a less-than-truckload (LTL) carrier or consolidated with other shipments and moved by truckload routes. When using a truckload carrier, the shipper takes advantage of contracted lane rates that are significantly less than comparable LTL prices for a full truckload. For larger instances that cannot be directly solved using commercial solvers, an IP-based local search approach is developed.</br>
