Title: Density of Alternative Fuel Stations and Refueling Availability<br>Author: Masashi Miyagawa, University of Yamanashi, 4-4-37 Takeda, Kofu, 400-8510, Japan, mmiyagawa@yamanashi.ac.jp<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper develops an analytical model for determining sufficient density of alternative fuel stations required to achieve a certain level of service. The service level is represented as the probability that the vehicle can make the repeated round trip between randomly selected origin and destination. The probability demonstrates how the density of stations, the vehicle range, the trip length, and the refueling availability at origin and destination affect the service level.
