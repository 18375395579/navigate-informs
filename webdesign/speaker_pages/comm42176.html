Title: RealTime Control Strategies for Transit Operations on a Corridor with Vehicles?Capacity Constraints<br>Author: Ricardo Giesen, Assistant Professor, Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Transport Engineering and Logistics, Santiago, RM, 6904411, Chile, giesen@ing.puc.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Felipe Delgado, Juan Carlos Munoz, Aldo Cipriano<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a math programming model to update operational plans on a transit corridor, based on real-time information about demands and travel times, which considers additional waiting time at stops due to vehicles?capacity constraints. The performance of proposed strategies is simulated on high demand scenarios, and the benefits are discussed.
