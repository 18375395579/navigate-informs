This problem has  applications in smart grids where storage can be used to control  the output of e.g. wind or PV.  We treat the objectives to minimize the number of charging cycles or the  total energy flow through the battery and show the boundary between  polynomial solvable and NP-hard problems. We also investigate the case  where multiple batteries are used in parallel.</br>
