<br>Title: Comparison of Optimization and Simulation for Hospital Evacuation Planning</br><br>Author: Esengul Tayfur, Clemson University, Department of Industrial Engineering, 110 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States, etayfur@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Taaffe</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research considers the allocation of resources for hospital evacuations that allow a pre-planned response, most notably hurricane evacuations. We propose two different approaches: deterministic optimization and simulation-optimization. We present resource requirements for an evacuation while addressing objectives including evacuation cost, evacuation time, or overall operational cost. We test several possible scenarios for both approaches and investigate the differences between them.</br>
