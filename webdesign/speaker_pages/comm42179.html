<br>Title: Advertising Revenue Optimization in Live Television Broadcasting</br><br>Author: Dana Popescu, Assistant Professor of Technology and Operations Management, INSEAD, Fontainbleau, France, dana.popescu@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ajay Srinivasan, Pascale Crama</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In live broadcasting, the break lengths available for commercials may not always be fixed and known ex ante (e.g., strategic and injury time-outs are of variable duration in live sport transmissions). Broadcasters actively manage their revenue by jointly optimizing their sales and scheduling policies. We characterize the optimal dynamic schedule in a setting that incorporates stochastic break durations and ad lengths of 30 and 15 seconds. We also address the portfolio composition problem.</br>
