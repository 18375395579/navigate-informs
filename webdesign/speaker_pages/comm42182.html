This gives rise to many questions: Is best-reply dynamics guaranteed to converge to a stable state? What happens in asynchronous settings in which the communication between agents can be delayed or dropped? Is it in the best interest of the agents to follow best-reply dynamics?     We characterize a subclass of games, which contains all dominance-solvable ones. For this subclass we prove that the best-reply dynamics converges within polynomial time to a pure Nash equilibrium. Moreover, we show that convergence is assured even in  asynchronous settings in which communication between players may be delayed or lost.    We then study best-replies strategies in the context of mechanism design. We characterize a narrower subclass of games for which we prove that best-reply strategies are ex-post-Nash incentive-compatible. We provide several examples: stable-roommate  problems, network-routing games, and first-price auctions.</br>
