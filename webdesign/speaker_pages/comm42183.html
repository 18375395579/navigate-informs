Title: Positive Externalities and Optimal Scale<br>Author: Ramesh Johari, Stanford University, rjohari@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sunil Kumar<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a system where many identical customers use a single  service. Each customer experiences both positive and negative  externalities from other customers using the service.  We study the ratio of Nash equilibrium welfare to socially optimal welfare, as well as the welfare of a single individual at the Nash equilibrium, as the number of customers in the system varies.  Our main result is that both these quantities are simultaneously maximized at a positive optimal scale.
