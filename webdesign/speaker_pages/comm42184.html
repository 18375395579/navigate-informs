Title: Inapproximability of Pure Nash Equilibria in Congestion Games<br>Author: Alexander Skopalik, PhD Student, RWTH Aachen, Lehrstuhl für Informatik 1, Aachen, Germany, skopalik@cs.rwth-aachen.de<br>Coauthor(s): Berthold Vöcking<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A natural and convincing notion of approximation for equilibria in  congestion games assumes that agents are ambivalent between strategies  whose delay differs by less than a factor of alpha. We show that computing an  alpha-approximate equilibrium is PLS-complete, for any alpha > 1. Thus finding an approximate Nash equilibrium is as hard as finding an exact Nash equilibrium or solving any other problem in PLS.
