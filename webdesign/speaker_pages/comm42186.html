Title: Optimization of Consumption and Investment Decisions Under Consumption and Liquidity Constraints<br>Author: John Birge, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, John.Birge@ChicagoGSB.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amit Bhandari<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We extend previous work on discrete-time optimization of consumption and investment decisions with non-decreasing consumption rate. Assuming an attractive hedge fund exists, i.e. Merton's (1969) continuous-time model ignoring consumption would conclude that the optimal allocation to this fund should be high. We examine the impact of a discrete-time framework, non-decreasing consumption and liquidity constraints due to the hedge fund's trading rules on optimal consumption and investment policies.
