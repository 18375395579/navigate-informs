Assuming an attractive hedge fund exists, i.e. Merton's (1969) continuous-time model ignoring consumption would conclude that the optimal allocation to this fund should be high. We examine the impact of a discrete-time framework, non-decreasing consumption and liquidity constraints due to the hedge fund's trading rules on optimal consumption and investment policies.</br>
