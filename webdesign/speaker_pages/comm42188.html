Title: Detecting Robust Cliques in Graphs with Uncertain Edge Failures<br>Author: Oleksandra Yezerska, PhD Candidate, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, yaleksa@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sergiy Butenko, Vladimir Boginski<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present an exact algorithm for detecting robust cliques in graphs subject to uncertain edge failures. As clique can be alternatively defined based on its various properties, the edge failure may yield different types of losses. We will discuss two loss functions (the sum and the max of vertex degree violations) and show that utilizing each of them ensures with certain probability the solution (after edge failures) will be s-defective clique or s-plex, respectively.
