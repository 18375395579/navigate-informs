Title: Connections Between Singular Control and Optimal Switching<br>Author: Pascal Tomecek, PhD Student, School of OR&IE, 294 Rhodes Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, pit3@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xin Guo<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We explore new connections between finite variation singular control and sequential optimal stopping problems. We apply our results, along with the standard probabilistic approach to singular control, to extend the theory of reversible investment. We give sufficient conditions on the existence of an optimal solution and on the regularity of the value function. Application areas include energy and credit risk management, and markets with friction.
