Title: Flexibility of Intermodal Freight Transport Network<br>Author: Lichun Chen, University of Maryland, College park, MD, 20742, United States, lcchen@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elise Miller-Hooks<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The problem of measuring flexibility (i.e. ability to continue operations, adapt to changing circumstances and return to normal operations) of intermodal freight transport networks is addressed. Results of experiments conducted to illustrate the proposed flexibility concept and proposed methodology for its characterization are given for the freight transport corridor between New York and Washington.
