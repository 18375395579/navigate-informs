Title: On Convergence Rates of Convex Regression in Multiple Dimensions<br>Author: Eunji Lim, Assistant Professor, University of Miami, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, United States of America, lim@miami.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a least squares estimator for estimating a convex function with bounded subgradients. A rate at which the sum of squared differences between the estimator and the true function converges to zero is computed. This work sheds light on computing  the convergence rate of the multi-dimensional convex regression estimator studied by Lim and Glynn (2012).
