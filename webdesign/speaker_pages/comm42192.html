Title: Importance Sampling for a Tandem Queue with Server Slowdown<br>Author: Kevin Leder, Postdoctoral Fellow, Columbia University, â€?00 W 120th St # 450, 3rd Floor, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, kevinleder@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Dupuis, Hui Wang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating buffer overflow probabilities of a queuing system with two queues in tandem where the service rate of the first server slows down when the buffer size of the downstream queue reaches a given threshold. We propose an importance sampling algorithm for estimating these probabilities and show that this algorithm is asymptotically efficient. The construction of our change of measure is based on a PDE approach to importance sampling that is broadly applicable.
