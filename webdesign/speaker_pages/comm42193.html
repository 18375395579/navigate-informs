Title: Valuing a Natural Gas Storage Facility via a Real Options Approach<br>Author: Youyi Feng, Associate Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, The Department of SEEM, R609, M. W. Mong Engineering Building, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - ROC, yyfeng@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Zhan Pang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider valuing a storage facility for an independent and risk-neutral natural gas marketer who plans to own or rent the facility for facilitating  gas trading in an energy commodity exchange. We optimize the integrated decisions on gas trading and storage operations over a finite or an infinite horizon by switch-curve policies. We assess the capacity investment of a storage and a long-term renting agreement with the storage owner, respectively.
