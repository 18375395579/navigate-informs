<br>Title: Inventory Decisions for Emergency Supplies Based on Hurricane Count Predictions</br><br>Author: Emmett Lodree, Auburn University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Auburn, AL, United States of America, elodree@auburn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Selda Taskin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a multi-period inventory planning problem characterized by uncertain demand during each period prior to the ensuing hurricane season, that also accounts for a target inventory level at the beginning of the season. The problem is formulated as a stochastic programming model. Scenario reduction and stability are discussed.</br>
