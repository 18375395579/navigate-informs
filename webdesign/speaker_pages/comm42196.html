<br>Title: Optimal Siding Location Model for Mixed-use Rail Corridors</br><br>Author: Mei-Cheng Shih, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Illinois RailTEC, B118 Newmark Lab, 205 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, mshih2@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tyler Dick</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many mixed-use single-track rail lines in North America are expected to reach their capacity due to the increasing demand for higher-speed passenger traffic.  This research aims to develop an Optimal Siding Location Model to determine the optimal number and location of new sidings to add to rail lines with consideration of traffic characteristics and infrastructure properties.  This decision support tool can help maximize the benefits of siding expansion projects.</br>
