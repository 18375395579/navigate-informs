Title: Dimensioning the Repairman Problem with Spares<br>Author: Isilay Degirmenci, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, it@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Otis Jennings, Francis de Véricourt<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consider the repairmen problem with spares consisting of n machines that breakdown, s repairmen and m spare machines. As a function of n, we set a staffing (of repairmen) and stocking (of spares) policy pair. Each element of the policy falls into one of three limiting regime categories: efficiency-driven, quality-driven or quality- and efficiency-driven. For each valid regime combination, we prove many-server limit theorems. Selection of the policy is accomplished through constraint satisfaction or cost minimization.
