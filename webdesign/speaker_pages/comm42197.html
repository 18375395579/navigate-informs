As a function of n, we set a staffing (of repairmen) and stocking (of spares) policy pair. Each element of the policy falls into one of three limiting regime categories: efficiency-driven, quality-driven or quality- and efficiency-driven. For each valid regime combination, we prove many-server limit theorems. Selection of the policy is accomplished through constraint satisfaction or cost minimization.</br>
