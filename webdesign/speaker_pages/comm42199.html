Title: How do Open-space Reserves Affect Housing Prices and Urban Growth?<br>Author: Robert Haight, USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, 1992 Folwell Ave, St. Paul, MN, 55108, United States, rhaight@fs.fed.us<br>Coauthor(s): Liaila Tajibaeva, Stephen Polasky<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We use an urban-economic model to study the effects of open space on the spatial pattern of housing and property values in a city. Households choose where to live and how much to spend on housing and transportation. The government chooses property tax and the location of open space.  We show that open space does not stop growth but attracts people and increases nearby housing and land price. Planners can maximize welfare by locating open space on the edge and housing near the center of the city.
