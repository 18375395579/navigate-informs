The concept starts from partitioning the entire networks into controllable sub-areas. The upper-level problem aims to divert traffic among different sub-areas. The lower problem aims to optimize local traffic within the sub-area. Various methods in network partitioning, upper- and lower-level flow control strategies are presented and discussed.</br>
