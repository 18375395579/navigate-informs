Title: A Hierarchical Urban Traffic Control Problem<br>Author: Paul Hoffer, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States of America, phoffer@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chang Chiu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this talk, we discuss a concept of hierarchical control of urban vehicular traffic. The concept starts from partitioning the entire networks into controllable sub-areas. The upper-level problem aims to divert traffic among different sub-areas. The lower problem aims to optimize local traffic within the sub-area. Various methods in network partitioning, upper- and lower-level flow control strategies are presented and discussed.
