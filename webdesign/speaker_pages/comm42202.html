Seiford</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This study examines several properties of network topologies and how these properties change during  periods of transition. Transitions periods could include a redesign of the existing network topology or merging of two different topologies. Case studies will be given in each scenario to determine efficiency strategies for change.</br>
