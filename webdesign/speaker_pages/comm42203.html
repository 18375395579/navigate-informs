This schedules the arriving flights according to the airport's reduced capacities. The Ration-by-Distance (RBD) algorithm has been proven to minimize the expected delay of a GDP, when the end time is uncertain. Here, we formulate an Integer Program for the GDP with uncertain end time and show that the RBD algorithm provides an optimal solution to the LP Relaxation of this formulation.</br>
