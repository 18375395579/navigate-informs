<br>Title: Multiple Criteria Broadcasting for Wireless Networks</br><br>Author: Brian Barritt, Graduate Student, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, barritt@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hyun Kim, Behnam Malakooti, Shahdi Malakooti</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In a MANET, simple broadcast schemes flood the network with broadcast storms, and more complex broadcast schemes adapt poorly to changing network conditions. As a solution, we propose Multiple-Criteria Broadcasting (MCB) where the source of a broadcast assigns the importance to broadcast objectives. Network nodes use this policy to intelligently relay broadcast messages. Using ns2 simulation, we demonstrate that MCB offers a more efficient and flexible approach to MANET broadcasting.</br>
