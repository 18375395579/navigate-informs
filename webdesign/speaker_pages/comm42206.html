<br>Title: A Quay Crane System That Self-Recovers from Random Shocks</br><br>Author: Yun Fong Lim, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 50 Stamford Road, #04-01, Singapore, SG, Singapore, yflim@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yan Zhang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The main challenge for a container terminal is to maximize its throughput using limited resources subject to various operational constraints. Traditional approaches often require re-planning when the system is subject to random shocks. We propose an operating protocol to coordinate the cranes so that the system spontaneously recovers from shocks and persistently restores its throughput near its full capacity.</br>
