<br>Title: Decentralized Assignment and Hierarchical Crowdsourcing</br><br>Author: Mohamed Mostagir, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., D32-632, Cambrdige, MA, 02139, United States of America, mosta@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daron Acemoglu, Asuman Ozdaglar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Consider an assignment problem where a number of workers of unknown skill are to be matched to a number of tasks of unknown difficulty. Ideally, a taskmaster would prefer that the most skilled workers are assigned the most difficult jobs. However, workers prefer to take on easy tasks. We provide a mechanism and a payment scheme that induce workers to form a market for tasks and endogenously sort themselves according to their abilities so that the desired assignment is implemented.</br>
