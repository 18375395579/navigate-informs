Ideally, a taskmaster would prefer that the most skilled workers are assigned the most difficult jobs. However, workers prefer to take on easy tasks. We provide a mechanism and a payment scheme that induce workers to form a market for tasks and endogenously sort themselves according to their abilities so that the desired assignment is implemented.
