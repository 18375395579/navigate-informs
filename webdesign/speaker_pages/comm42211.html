The governments?mandate is to maximize the societal benefit by acting as agents of the public. Participants often patronize a publicly funded facility with highest accessibility. We assume that the time spent for receiving the service from a facility is a good proxy for its accessibility. We formalize the basic network design problem for the public sector and develop an exact approach to solve it.</br>
