Rossetti</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Two assumptions are often made in network protection models: 1) protected elements cannot fail, and 2) unprotected elements exposed to a hazard always fail completely. Challenging these assumptions, we study a problem in which hazards cause capacity degradation of network elements. The post-hazard capacity of an element is a random function of the amount of protection allocated to that element. We present a stochastic programming strategy for this problem.</br>
