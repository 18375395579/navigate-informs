<br>Title: Improving Facility Supply Chain Efficiency through Storage and Routing Optimization</br><br>Author: Guiping Hu, Iowa State University, 3014 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, gphu@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nazanin Zinouri</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Warehouse operation is essential for production and logistics planning. This research focuses on storage optimization, order picking and delivery improvements with emphasis on reducing the total travel time. The objective is to reduce the total system cost at a manufacturing facility. The storage and routing optimization problems are validated through simulation. The results show that warehouse operation optimization can lead to a more efficient production system.</br>
