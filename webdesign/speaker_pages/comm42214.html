So congestion occurs. Monitoring the detour route based on real-time information is necessary to avoid major disruption in the overall network.  The situation calls for continuous evaluation of the surrounding network and real time rerouting. An electrical analog of the road network is developed to find  the lowest cost path that is independent of the map complexity.</br>
