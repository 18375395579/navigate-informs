Title: Stress on the Ward: Evidence of Safety Tipping Points in Hospitals<br>Author: Stefan Scholtes, Professor, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, United Kingdom, s.scholtes@jbs.cam.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Ludwig Kuntz, Roman Mennicken<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present an empirical study of occupancy-related safety tipping points for in-hospital mortality using discharge records of 82,280 patients across six high-mortality-risk conditions from 83 German hospitals. We estimate a mortality tipping point at an occupancy level of 92.5%. Among the 14.7% of patients in our sample who experienced occupancy above the tipping point, high occupancy accounted for 17% of the deaths. The existence of a safety tipping point has significant implications for hospital management. In our sample, flexible staffing achieves the same mortality reduction as rigid staffing at 60% of the cost, while pooling of near-by hospitals reduces the number of deaths due to high occupancy by 39.5%.
