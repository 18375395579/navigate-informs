We estimate a mortality tipping point at an occupancy level of 92.5%. Among the 14.7% of patients in our sample who experienced occupancy above the tipping point, high occupancy accounted for 17% of the deaths. The existence of a safety tipping point has significant implications for hospital management. In our sample, flexible staffing achieves the same mortality reduction as rigid staffing at 60% of the cost, while pooling of near-by hospitals reduces the number of deaths due to high occupancy by 39.5%.</br>
