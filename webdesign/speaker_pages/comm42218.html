<br>Title: Designing Aviation Security Systems Using a Sequential Decision Process</br><br>Author: Alexander Nikolaev, Dept of Computer Science, Univ of Illinois, 201 N Goodwin Ave, Siebel Center, Room 1218-4, Urbana, IL, 61801-2302, anikolae@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laura McLay, Sheldon H. Jacobson</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper introduces the sequential stochastic security design problem (SSSDP) for aviation security screening operations. SSSDP is formulated as a two-stage model, where in the first stage security devices are purchased, and in the second stage a policy determines how passengers are screened, with the objective to maximize the total security of all passenger-screening decisions.</br>
