Title: Conditions-Based Approach to Regression Estimation in Robust Parameter Design<br>Author: Gregory Boylan, Clemson University, Rm 150, Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, United States of America, boylangc@earthlink.net<br>Coauthor(s): Byung Rae Cho<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Typical robust design problems use least squares regression to determine optimal process settings by assuming normality and moderate variability in process outputs. In reality such conditions rarely hold, which can adversely affect results if ignored. This research examines alternative regression approaches to ascertain which estimators yield better solutions when high-variability and asymmetric conditions exist. Numerical studies and simulation facilitate comparison with traditional approaches.
