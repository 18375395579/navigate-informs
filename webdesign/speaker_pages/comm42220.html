The strategies are aimed at determining the optimal time discretization resolution of time-dependent travel time data for network links/nodes in order to achieve a desirable balance between solution accuracy and memory usage. The strategies are applied to a time-dependent shortest path algorithm in a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment environment to study the computational properties of such strategies.</br>
