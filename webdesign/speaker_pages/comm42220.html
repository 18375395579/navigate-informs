Title: A Variable Time Discretization Based Time-dependent Shortest Path Algorithm ?Experience with Simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model<br>Author: Ye Tian, tianye@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chang Chiu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This talk introduces two variable time discretization strategies applicable to time-dependent shortest path algorithms. The strategies are aimed at determining the optimal time discretization resolution of time-dependent travel time data for network links/nodes in order to achieve a desirable balance between solution accuracy and memory usage. The strategies are applied to a time-dependent shortest path algorithm in a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment environment to study the computational properties of such strategies.
