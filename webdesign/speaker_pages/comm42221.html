If the arrival rate for processor sharing queue has unbounded growth over time, then it is possible for the number of customers in a processor sharing queue to grow so quickly that a newly entering job never finishes. We define the minimum size for such a job to be the event horizon for a processor sharing  queue. We discuss the use of such a concept and develop some of its properties.</br>
