Title: Event Horizon for a Processor Sharing Queue<br>Author: Robert Hampshire, Carnegie Mellon University, 4800 Forbes Ave, 2102B Hamburg Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, hamp@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Massey<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We identify a phenomenon for processor sharing queues that is unique  to ones with time-varying rates. If the arrival rate for processor sharing queue has unbounded growth over time, then it is possible for the number of customers in a processor sharing queue to grow so quickly that a newly entering job never finishes. We define the minimum size for such a job to be the event horizon for a processor sharing  queue. We discuss the use of such a concept and develop some of its properties.
