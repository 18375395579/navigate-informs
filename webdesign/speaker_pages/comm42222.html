Title: The Retail Planning Problem under Demand Uncertainty<br>Author: George Georgiadis, University of California-Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, georgiadis@ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kumar Rajaram<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the Retail Planning Problem in which a retailer chooses suppliers, and determines production, distribution and inventory planning for products with uncertain demand to minimize total expected costs. This problem is faced by retail chains that carry private label products. We formulate it as a convex MIP, which is NP-hard, and we construct bounding procedures. Our computational results indicate that the feasible solutions are close to optimal. Finally, we develop managerial insights.
