Title: The Network Evolution Problem in Transportation Planning<br>Author: Lei Zhang, Assistant Professor, Oregon State University, School of Civil & Construction Eng., 220 Owen Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331, United States, lei.zhang@oregonstate.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In response to increased transportation system preservation costs and insufficient funds for needed system expansion, this paper formulates the Network Evolution Problem (NEP) that considers strategic resource allocation between system preservation and expansion. The proposed analytical framework allows certain parts of the system to grow and certain other parts to degenerate in response to changing demand patterns. Solutions to the NEP are demonstrated on several stylized networks.
