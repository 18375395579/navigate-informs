Title: Effects of Market-Based Uncertainty on Optimal Flows of Fuels and Power in the U.S.<br>Author: Yan Wang, Research Assistant, Iowa State University, 2019 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011-2164, United States, yanwang@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sarah Ryan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A generalized network flow model of the U.S. electric energy system reveals ideal movements of coal, natural gas and electric power.  We introduce uncertainties in fuel prices and market demands for electric power and use stochastic programming to learn how energy flows would be affected if the national energy system were planned optimally under these uncertainties.
