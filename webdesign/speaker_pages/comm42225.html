Title: Dynamic Routing and Scheduling in Drayage Operations<br>Author: Guangming Zhang, g-zhang@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karen Smilowitz<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This research explores modeling and solution techniques for dynamic routing and scheduling problems in drayage operations.  In intermodal drayage applications, it is typical that about 60% of task requests are known before the day of operation and the remaining 40% become known over the day.
