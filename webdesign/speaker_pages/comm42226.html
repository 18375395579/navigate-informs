<br>Title: Issuing Policies for Hospital Blood Inventory</br><br>Author: Alireza Sabouri, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, Alireza.Sabouri@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tim Huh, Steven Shechter</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a model for allocating red blood cells for transfusion to patients, which is motivated by recent evidence suggesting that transfusing older blood is associated with increased mortality rate. We study the properties of blood issuance policies that balance the trade-off between “quality?measured in average age of blood transfused and “efficiency?measured in the amount of shortage. Based on our analysis, we design efficient issuance policies and evaluate their performance.</br>
