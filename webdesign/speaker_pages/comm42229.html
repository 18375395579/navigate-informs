<br>Title: Fair Dynamic Routing Policies in Large-scale Service Systems with Heterogeneous Servers</br><br>Author: Mor Armony, Associate Professor, NYU, 44 West 4th Street, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, marmony@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Amy Ward</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Call centers typically have many agents answering calls with different speeds. A key control issue that arises is how to route calls to agents. It has been shown that routing calls to the fastest agent first asymptotically minimizes steady-state customer waiting times. Unfortunately, this policy penalizes the faster agents by keeping them busy at all times. We address the question of how to optimize system performance subject to fairness with respect to server utilization.</br>
