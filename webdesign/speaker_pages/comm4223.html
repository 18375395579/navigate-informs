The effect of the catastrophic event on the flexibility is shown by comparing the option values of a single investment and a multistage one. Additionally, in a case that both a cost associated with the construction and the catastrophic event are dependent on the location, we determine simultaneously the optimal investment timing and location of the power plant.</br>
