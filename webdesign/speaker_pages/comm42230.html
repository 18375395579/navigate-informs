Title: Scenario-based and Mean-variance Hedge Fund Portfolio Allocation with High Watermarks<br>Author: Ivilina Popova, Assistant Professor, Seattle University, 901 12th Avenue, Seattle, WA, 98122, United States of America, popovai@seattleu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Morton<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this analysis we show that using a scenario-based approach for portfolio allocation is preferable to a mean-variance approach when constructing a fund of hedge funds. The performance fee charged by hedge funds is often linked to high watermarks and if the objective is to increase the fees received, the utility function should incorporate a subsistence level. We show that the scenario-based approach is the better methodology when optimizing utility functions with subsistence levels.
