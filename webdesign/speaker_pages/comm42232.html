Title: Network Simplex for the Traffic Assignment Problem<br>Author: Hong Zheng, University of Arizona, Tucson, United States of America, hzheng@email.arizona.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a network-simplex-like algorithm for the static traffic assignment problem. We show the algorithm can produce high precise solution with fast convergence on large-scale networks.
