Users have time-varying connectivity due to working hours, and backup attempts are initiated locally, without knowledge of the status of other users or the network load. The backup schedule is characterized by hourly backup probabilities, and we discuss how to choose the backup probabilities so as to stabilize the system and minimize the network costs.</br>
