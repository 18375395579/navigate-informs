<br>Title: Assortment Optimization under the Multi-level Nested Logit Model</br><br>Author: Paat Rusmevichientong, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, United States of America, rusmevic@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guang Li, Huseyin Topaloglu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider assortment optimization problems under the multi-level nested logit model. We show that the assortment optimization problem under this choice model can be solved in O(d n log n) operations, where d is the number of levels in the choice tree and n is the total number of products.</br>
