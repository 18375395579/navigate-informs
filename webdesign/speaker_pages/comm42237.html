<br>Title: Dynamic Supply Routing for a Make-to-order Manufacturing Network</br><br>Author: Jeremie Gallien, MIT Sloan School of Management, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, jgallien@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rohit Bhatnagar, Teo Chee Chong, John Foreman, Julie Alspaugh, Charles Dubois</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Dell’s supply chain for desktops involves Asian vendors shipping components by sea to several U.S. plants. While suppliers are responsible for shipping enough inventory, Dell can reroute and expedite their shipments while in transit to balance inventory across sites and dynamically track geographic demand patterns. We present optimization models developed with Dell to address this routing challenge and some insights gained from their implementation.</br>
