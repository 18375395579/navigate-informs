Title: Strategic Health Workforce Planning: Modeling, Optimality, and Uncertainty<br>Author: Weihong Hu, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Avenue, GER 240, Los Angeles, 90089-0899, United States of America, weihongh@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mariel Lavieri, Alejandro Toriello, Xiang Liu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose an infinite-horizon linear programming model for workforce planning in a large health system for a single worker class. We prove the optimality of a natural look-ahead policy applicable to any system of this kind, and use real-world data to examine the performance of the policy in more complex systems with additional detail. The results motivate us to further analyze the impact of demand uncertainty.
