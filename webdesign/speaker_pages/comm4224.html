For Markovian queues, we prove that ISA always converges. Moreover, our simulation experiments show that the ISA yields time-stable delay probabilities across a wide range of target probabilities. Other call center performance measures, such as agent utilizations, abandonment probabilities and mean waiting times, are stable as well.</br>
