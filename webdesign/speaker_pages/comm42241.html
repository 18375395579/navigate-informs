Title: Network Location of a Reliable Center Using the Most Reliable Route Policy<br>Author: Jos?Santiváñez, Assistant Professor, Universidad del Turabo, PO BOX 3030, Gurabo, PR, 00778, Puerto Rico, santivanezj@SUAGM.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Emanuel Melachrinoudis<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a single location problem on an undirected general network with unreliable edges so as to minimize the maximum expected number of unsuccessful responses to demand requests over all nodes.  A polynomial time algorithm and computational results are presented.
