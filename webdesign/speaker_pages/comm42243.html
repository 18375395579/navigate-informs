Title: Railroad Transportation of Hazardous Materials: A Tactical Planning Model<br>Author: Vedat Verter, Associate Professor, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Street W., Montreal, QC, H3A 1G5, Canada, vedat.verter@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Manish Verma, Michel Gendreau<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We will present an optimization model with risk and cost objectives, wherein the assessment of rail transport risk is focused on airborne hazardous materials. The model aims at identifying the most appropriate routing of railcars, yard activities, and number of trains of different types needed for each service.  We developed a memetic algorithm for this problem and will illustrate the its use on a large-scale real life problem instance.
