Title: Limit Theorems and Robustness for BSDEs<br>Author: Mitja Stadje, Graduate Student, Princeton University, Lawrence Drive 11, Ap. 402, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, mstadje@Princeton.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Cheridito<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs)  in discrete time. After obtaining stability results we prove convergence of  BSDEs in discrete time to their counterparts in continuous time  for drivers that grow less than quadratically. We also consider BSDEs with convex driver functions. In this case we obtain strong robustness results. This is  joint work with Patrick Cheridito.
