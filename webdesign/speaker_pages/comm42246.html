Title: Optimizing the Aerodynamic Efficiency of Intermodal Freight Trains<br>Author: Yung-Cheng Lai, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, B-118 Newmark Lab, 205 N. Matthews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, lai3@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yanfeng Ouyang, Hayri Onal, Christopher Barkan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: An IP model was developed to optimize aerodynamic efficiency of intermodal trains using available loads. More effective solutions may be possible with advance information on arriving loads and trains. We extend the model to optimize at the system level, and develop a rolling horizon scheme for 24/7 terminal operations.
