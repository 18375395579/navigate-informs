Title: The Open Pit Mine Production Scheduling Problem<br>Author: Alexandra Newman, Associate Professor, Colorado School of Mines, Division of Economics and Business, Golden, CO, 80401, United States, anewman@mines.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Wood<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe some techniques to expedite solution time of the classical open pit block sequencing problem, i.e., that of maximizing net present value subject to operational capacity and block sequencing constraints. We then address topics in ore grade uncertainty of the blocks.
