Title: Consistency in Vehicle Routing using Clustering<br>Author: Fahrettin Cakir, The University of Iowa, Tippie Business College, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, fahrettin-cakir@uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Consistent service in vehicle routing is a valuable aspect for parcel delivery firms. This is due to driver familiarity and learning which enables drivers to serve neighborhoods quicker. We formulate a two stage vehicle routing decision problem in which the first stage puts emphasis on assigning customers to those drivers that have served the most via an auxiliary expression in the objective function in order to build consistent routing solutions.
