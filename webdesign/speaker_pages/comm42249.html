This is due to driver familiarity and learning which enables drivers to serve neighborhoods quicker. We formulate a two stage vehicle routing decision problem in which the first stage puts emphasis on assigning customers to those drivers that have served the most via an auxiliary expression in the objective function in order to build consistent routing solutions.</br>
