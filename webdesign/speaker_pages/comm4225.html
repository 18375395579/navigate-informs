<br>Title: Heavy Traffic Optimality of Balanced Routing</br><br>Author: Hengqing Ye, Dept of Logistics, Faculty of Business, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China, lgtyehq@inet.polyu.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hong Chen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study a system with many parallel service stations. Upon arrival, a job is routed to the queue of a station following a balanced routing scheme: choose a few stations with specific probabilities and then send the job to the one with shortest queue. We show that this routing control is asymptotic optimal in the sense that it minimizes the workload over all time in the heavy traffic regime.</br>
