Title: Serially Linked Water Reservoir Network Design<br>Author: Olga Myndyuk, RUTCOR, Rutgers University, United States of America, olik.myn@gmail.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper, we find optimal reservoir capacities such that at least k consecutive periods the demands are met in the course of a given number of periods with a probability which is greater  than or equal to the prescribed probability. Formulation, mathematical properties and the solution methodology of the model are given. Numerical example for 2 reservoirs with 8 consecutive out of 24 periods is presented for the model with demand and inflow being normally distributed random variables.
