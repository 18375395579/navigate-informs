Title: A Queue with Skill Based Service under FCFS-ALIS<br>Author: Ivo Adan, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, Netherlands, iadan@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Gideon Weiss<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a queueing system with multi-type customers and multi-type servers, under FCFS-ALIS policy: A server always picks the first, longest  waiting compatible customer, a customer is always assigned to the longest idle compatible  server. We derive an explicit product-form expression for the steady state distribution, when service capacity is sufficient, and we also analyze the system under overload.
