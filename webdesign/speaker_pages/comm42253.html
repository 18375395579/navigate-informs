Title: Network Information Theory via Robust Optimization<br>Author: Dimitris Bertsimas, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, dbertsim@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chaithanya Bandi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We provide via robust optimization (RO) inner and outer bounds for the capacity region of multi-user channels with interference for finite code length n and a code that matches the inner bound.As n increases,the bounds are tight and lead to an asymptotic characterization of the capacity region which is a well-known open problem.The RO problems take the form of rank minimization SDPs for Gaussian and MILPs for Exponential, Binary and Uniform channels. We report results for up to 200000 codewords.
