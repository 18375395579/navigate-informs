We present a pricing model that fairly allocates the cost of the trip among all the passengers as well as ensures that it is always cheaper to request a ride as early as possible, an algorithm that routes and schedules the vehicles that minimizes the cost and passenger travel times, and a network equilibrium model that determines the optimal number of riders.</br>
