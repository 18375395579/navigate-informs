Candidate., Erasmus University Rotterdam, 1738, Rotterdam, NL, 3000 DR, Netherlands, jlarco@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rene de Koster, Jan Dul, Kees Jan Roodbergen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper relaxes the common assumption that facility workers work in steady-rate production rates similar to the behavior of machines. The paper analyzes the effect of changing the difficulty of obtaining a production target and the target deadline in production rates and physical exertion. We propose a theoretical model where employees choose their production rate based on a decision making model that contains known systematic biases from the literature.</br>
