Title: Forecasting and Staffing Call Centers with Multiple Uncertain Arrival Streams<br>Author: Han Ye, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, hanye@live.unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Luedtke, Haipeng Shen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the integrated problem of forecasting and staffing call centers with multiple uncertain arrival streams. We develop models to forecast multi-stream call arrivals, by considering three types of Inter-Stream Dependence (ISD). With the forecasts, we use a chance-constraint formulation to generate staffing vectors and further assess the operational effects. Our theoretical and numerical analyses bring insights into how various types of ISD affect forecasting and operational practice.
