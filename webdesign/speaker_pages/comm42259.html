Title: Optimal Synthesis of Fuel Gas Networks<br>Author: Iftekhar Karimi, Professor, National University of Singapore, Department of Chem & Biomolecular Eng, 4 Engineering Drive 4, Singapore, Singapore, cheiak@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): M M Faruque Hasan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We identify the numerous fuel sources and sinks for LNG and refinery systems, and pose the network problem as a generalized pooling problem with the additional complexity of product quality constraints (e.g. Wobbe Index), compression costs, and pressure variations among sources and sinks. The concept of superstructure has been used.
