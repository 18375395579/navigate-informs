Title: Tractable Robust Expected Utility and Risk Models for Portfolio Optimization<br>Author: Melvyn Sim, Professor, NUS Business School, Singapore-MIT Alliance, 1 Business Link, Singapore, 117592, Singapore, dscsimm@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Joline Uichanco, Karthik Natarajan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We derive exact and approximate optimal trading strategies for a robust or maximin expected utility model where the distributions of the random returns are practially characterized. The investor's utility is modeled as a piecewise-linear concave function. We also provide connections of our results with robust or ambiguous convex risk measures, in which the investor minimizes his worst case risk under distributional ambiguity.
