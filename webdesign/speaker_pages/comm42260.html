<br>Title: Tractable Robust Expected Utility and Risk Models for Portfolio Optimization</br><br>Author: Melvyn Sim, Professor, NUS Business School, Singapore-MIT Alliance, 1 Business Link, Singapore, 117592, Singapore, dscsimm@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joline Uichanco, Karthik Natarajan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We derive exact and approximate optimal trading strategies for a robust or maximin expected utility model where the distributions of the random returns are practially characterized. The investor's utility is modeled as a piecewise-linear concave function. We also provide connections of our results with robust or ambiguous convex risk measures, in which the investor minimizes his worst case risk under distributional ambiguity.</br>
