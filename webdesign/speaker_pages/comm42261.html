Dharma Kwon, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1206 South Sixth Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, dhkwon@illinois.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the stopping problem of a decision-maker facing a catastrophic event with weak forewarning signals. We are particularly interested in the case the event is extremely rare and the occurrence of the event is extremely costly. The optimal policy is to stop when the posterior probability of the event exceeds an optimally chosen threshold. We also comment on stopping problems under risk-sensitivity of the decision-maker.</br>
