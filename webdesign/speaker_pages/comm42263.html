Title: Jet In, Jet Out, Jet Going! Reducing Air Travel Delays through the Use of Wayports<br>Author: Ashlee Knapp, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA, 15904, United States of America, knappa@ctc.com<br>Coauthor(s): Johnathon Dulin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In 2010, the Philadelphia and Newark airports had more than 63 million customers and were among the nation’s worst for on-time performance.  With over 40% of these being connecting passengers, what overall air traffic efficiency gains could be achieved if some of the 25 million superfluous travelers were removed from these bottleneck locations?  Here we describe our initial efforts aimed at assessing the impact of using an alternative airport in the region as a wayport for connecting customers.
