The formulation solves for optimal frequencies that vary throughout the course of the day on individual routes and associated service patterns.  Objectives include ridership maximization, waiting time minimization and cost minimization, subject to fleet and crowding considerations. Detailed demand elasticity levels are used in an application to the Chicago area network.</br>
