Title: Improving the Distribution Network of Humanitarian Aid for the Colombian Red Cross<br>Author: Fidel Torres, Associate Professor, Universidad de los Andes, Industrial Engineering Department, Bogota, Colombia, ftorres@uniandes.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): Annia Guatibonza, Rafael Cuervo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The objective of this work is to formulate a policy of pre-positioning of humanitarian aid to the Colombian Red Cross through a mathematical programming model. The study proposes the optimal location of new warehouses in strategic places and suggests logistics network configuration to maximize the amount of humanitarian aid delivered to vulnerable populations. A dynamical network configuration is recommended given the seasonal behavior of demand.
