Title: Beyond Edgeworth Expansions for Regularly Varying Random Walks<br>Author: Henry Lam, PhD Student, Harvard University, 1 Oxford St. 7th Floor, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, khlam@fas.harvard.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jose Blanchet, Martin Bazant, Damian Burch<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Edgeworth expansions provide additional correction terms to the Central Limit Theorem up to the highest moment. We provide subsequent correction terms beyond these expansions for regularly varying random walks. Our extra terms can be expressed in terms of the Dawson integral and behave qualitatively different depending on whether the highest moment is odd, even or non-integer. Surprisingly, these terms can blend smoothly with large deviations or not depending on the qualitative behaviors.
