Title: Interdicting Probabilistic Shortest Paths: Models, Algorithms, and Applications<br>Author: Siqian Shen, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 2793 IOE, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, siqian@umich.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study Probabilistic Network Interdiction in computer networks and traffic routing. We consider two shortest-path problems with objectives of maximizing the probability that a chosen path is shorter than a critical length, and minimizing the path length attained with a fixed probability, respectively. We provide exact algorithms involving computation of $k$-shortest paths, and also develop heuristics and a column generation approach to approximate the results.
