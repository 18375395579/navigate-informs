We consider two shortest-path problems with objectives of maximizing the probability that a chosen path is shorter than a critical length, and minimizing the path length attained with a fixed probability, respectively. We provide exact algorithms involving computation of $k$-shortest paths, and also develop heuristics and a column generation approach to approximate the results.</br>
