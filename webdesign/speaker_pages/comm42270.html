Title: Robust Partitioning for Stochastic Vehicle Routing<br>Author: Erick Delage, Stanford University, Packard 069, Stanford, CA, United States of America, edelage@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yinyu Ye, John Carlsson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of region assignment for stochastic vehicle routing. In our framework, one wishes to assigned regions of the territory to a number of vehicles prior to knowing the actual location of demand points. Based on historical realizations of demand, our approach suggests formulating a set which is known to contain the true distribution of demand and finds an optimal partition which guarantees a maximum TSP cost over the set of vehicles for any of the distributions in this set.
