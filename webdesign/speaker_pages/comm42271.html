Title: The Effect of Local Scheduling in a Load Balancing Game<br>Author: Adam Wierman, Assistant Professor, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E.

In this paper, we show that the degree of inefficiency in load balancing designs is highly dependent on the scheduling discipline used locally at each of the servers.  Traditionally, the local scheduler performs Processor Sharing and the degree of inefficiency is bounded by the number of servers.  However, if the local scheduler does Shortest Remaining Processing Time the degree of inefficiency can be independent of the number of servers.
