Title: A Nationwide High-speed Rail System for Freight<br>Author: Russell Meller, Hefley Professor of Logistics, University of Arkansas, Center for Engr Logistics and Distrb., 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, rmeller@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jen Pazour, Kevin Gue<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: High-speed rail is often touted as a way to reduce congestion on the nation’s highways by removing passenger car traffic.  But reducing the amount of freight traffic would also reduce highway congestion.  So, given the advances in high-speed rail, the potential exists for developing a nationwide system for freight. We present a network design model that considers transit times and highway traffic and an application of it with data from a major truckload carrier as a potential case study.
