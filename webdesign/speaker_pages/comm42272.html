But reducing the amount of freight traffic would also reduce highway congestion.  So, given the advances in high-speed rail, the potential exists for developing a nationwide system for freight. We present a network design model that considers transit times and highway traffic and an application of it with data from a major truckload carrier as a potential case study.</br>
