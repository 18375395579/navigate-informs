Title: Adaptive Blending in Call Centers<br>Author: Ger Koole, VU University Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1081a, Amsterdam, Netherlands, ger.koole@vu.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Legros, Oualid Jouini<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine a model with inbound calls and emails. There is an infinite source of emails, calls arrive according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Non-preemptive priority is given to calls, emails are only assigned if the number of available agents exceeds a certain threshold level. The objective is to maximize the email throughput while satisfying a service level constraint for the inbound calls. We propose different adaptive methods to change the threshold and report on experiments.
