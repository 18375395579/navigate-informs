Title: An Optimal Stopping Rule for Sensor-driven Replacement and Spare Parts Inventory Decision Models<br>Author: Alaa Elwany, Ph.D Candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, elwany@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nagi Gabraeel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A sensor-driven decision model is proposed to determine and dynamically revise optimal replacement and inventory policies for partially degraded components given real-time sensory information.  An optimal stopping rule is then developed to decide when to stop updating and implement the most recently updated decision policy.  The presented real-world case study demonstrates that this results in better decisions and reduced costs due to the improved prediction accuracy of components?lifetimes.
