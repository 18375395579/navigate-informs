Title: Parallel Machine Scheduling to Minimize Overtime and Waste Costs<br>Author: Nickolas Freeman, PhD student, University of Alabama, Box 870226, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States of America, nkfreeman@cba.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Mittenthal, Sharif Melouk<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a parallel machine scheduling problem with sequence dependent setup times and costs, where production waste and processing times depend on machine assignments. We use an MIP formulation to minimize overtime and waste costs which captures trade-offs between these cost components. We also develop two heuristic solution approaches and bounds on their solution quality. Experiments show our approach outperforms more traditional scheduling objectives with respect to the costs considered.
