<br>Title: Planning Supply of Ballast for Maintenance in the Railroad</br><br>Author: Shankara Kuppa, Systems Engineer, Union Pacific Railroad, 1400 Douglas Street MC 580, Omaha, NE, 68179, United States of America, skuppa@up.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michelle Clark, John Fuller</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Ballast, typically crushed stone, forms the track-bed on which the rails and ties are laid. There are multiple supply pits for ballast, each with different qualities of the product. Demand emerges at multiple locations with varying needs for quality of the ballast and different priorities. We present a problem that finds an efficient allocation of pits to demand locations while minimizing the total cost of sourcing and transporting ballast while satisfying the underlying constraints.</br>
