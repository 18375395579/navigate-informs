To address this issue, we used large-scale p-median and capacitated facility location problems to create a scalable, three-tiered plan for optimal allocation of Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), HSA designated medical backpacks, and backpack resupply centers in Malawi. This plan will be used to direct the Beyond Traditional Borders' HSA backpack program scale-up.
