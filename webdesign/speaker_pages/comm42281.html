<br>Title: A Network Centrality Approach to Public Goods</br><br>Author: Ben Golub, Postodctoral Fellow, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 30 Wadsworth St. E53-379, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, ben.golub@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Elliott</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study coalition-proof equilibria of games where each player can repeatedly exert costly effort that provides different benefits to some others. The main result is a (never-vacuous) sufficient condition for such an equilibrium in terms of eigenvector centrality: the amount of effort an agent exerts is equal to a weighted sum of the efforts of the agents whose effort matters to him. We prove this without parametric assumptions using the Perron-Frobenius spectral theory of nonnegative matrices.</br>
