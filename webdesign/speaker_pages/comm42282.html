Title: Quantification of Railway Infrastructure Decisions<br>Author: Thomas Schlechte, Research Assistant, Zuse Institute Berlin, Takustrasse 7, Berlin, 14195, Germany, schlechte@zib.de<br>Coauthor(s): Ralf Borndoerfer<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This talk focuses on the macroscopic track allocation problem,   which consists in finding a conflict free set of   train routes of maximum value in a given railway network.  We present how the construction of optimal or saturated timetables by integer programming techniques can be used to support and   quantifiy main railway infrastructure decisions.  All experiments are performed on a part of   German long distance area; tttplib.zib.de provides   these simplified realistic data sets.
