<br>Title: Hierarchical Coordinated Control of Plug-in Electric Vehicles Charging in Multi-family Dwellings</br><br>Author: Wei Qi, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, qiwei@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhiwei Xu, Z. Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study electric vehicles charging coordination problem in multi-family dwellings. Various communities can access electric power through a common distribution transformer. We first formulate a centralized charging control problem to maximize the total utility of the charging service provider while satisfying customer demands and transformer capacity constraints. We then propose a decentralized problem and demonstrate its applicability in terms of computational efficiency and system reliability.</br>
