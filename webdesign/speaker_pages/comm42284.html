<br>Title: Buffer Configurations for Distribution Centers with Multi-stage Order-processing</br><br>Author: Kai Furmans, Professor, Dr.-Ing., Institut für Fördertechnik und Logistiksysteme (IFL), Universität Karlsruhe (TH), Karlsruhe, Germany, Kai.Furmans@ifl.uni-karlsruhe.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Huber</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Larger Warehouses usually organize the processing of customer orders in stages. In each of these stages several orders are processed in parallel in the same or in different areas of the distribution center.  In order to prevent blocking between these processes, buffers have to be used between the stages. A discrete time queuing model will be presented that addresses this issue and helps in sizing the buffers in different configurations.</br>
