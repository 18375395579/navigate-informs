Title: Consolidation and Coordination of Intermodal Freight Transport<br>Author: Wouter van Heeswijk, PhD Student, Twente University, Hallenweg 17, Enschede, 7522 NH, Netherlands, w.j.a.vanheeswijk@utwente.nl<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the potential of freight consolidation in an intermodal transportation environment, comprising road-, railroad- and barge transport. Relevant aspects of this subject are the pre-selection of requests that could be consolidated, waiting policies, and pricing schemes for shared loads. We develop a planning algorithm, aimed at efficient and cooperative freight transport. The performance of this algorithm is tested on real data from a Dutch logistic service provider.
