Title: Concurrent Quality and Reliability Optimization for MEMS<br>Author: Qianmei (May) Feng, Assistant Professor, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States of America, qmfeng@uh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hao Peng, David Coit<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The new technology of MEMS shows great promise for many critical applications. For a MEMS system designed with degrading components, quality and reliability need to be both considered concurrently over the product life cycle to benefit the manufacturer and the consumer. By rewarding the high system reliability and penalizing the quality loss, we developed probability and optimization models for a MEMS system to determine the burn-in period, specification limits, and system replacement intervals.
