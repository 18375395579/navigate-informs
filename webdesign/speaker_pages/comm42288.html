Title: Optimization of Rail Defect Inspection Frequency<br>Author: Tyler Dick, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, ctdick@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiang Liu, Rapik Saat, Alexander Lovett, Christopher Barkan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Broken rails are among the most frequent causes of freight-train derailments on U.S. railroads. A model is developed to address the trade-offs among various factors related to rail defect inspection frequency, in order to maximize rail transportation safety and efficiency. The model can be used to determine the optimal frequency of rail defect inspection and it provides a tool to aid development of a better-informed train derailment prevention policy.
