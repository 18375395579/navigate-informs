Title: The k-Median Problem on a Network with Random Travel Times and Loss-Averse Customers<br>Author: Jiamin Wang, Long Island University Post, Roth Hall 202, 720 Northern Blvd, Brookville, NY, 11548, United States of America, Jiamin.Wang@liu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a network facility location problem where travel times are random variables. Applying the prospect theory to model customers?loss aversion behavior, we develop a mathematical programming model to locate multiple facilities so as to minimize the weighted average of customer disutility due to traveling. We identify a set of dominant points and propose efficient solution procedures. Optimal solutions for different customer behaviors are also compared.
