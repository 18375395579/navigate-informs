Title: Network Interdiction via a Critical Disruption Path<br>Author: Greg Steeger, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, United States of America, gsteeger@mymail.mines.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steffen Rebennack, Donatella Granata<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Network interdiction models inhibit network operations through impeding the network’s connectivity, e.g. by deleting nodes or arcs in the network.  In our case, we remove the path that minimizes the number of nodes in the largest connected component.  This we term the Critical Disruption Path (CDP).  We develop a tailored Branch and Price algorithm to solve large problems more efficiently than standard algorithms.
