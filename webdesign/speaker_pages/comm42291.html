The motivating application is repairing damaged infrastructure components after an extreme event. Each task has an associated release date, which can be shifted earlier in time by allocating special resources to it. We discuss an online optimization setting where the release dates are not known, dispatching rules to determine the allocation of resources to tasks, and promising computational results.</br>
