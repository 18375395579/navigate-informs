The challenge was to schedule strictly periodic services with a perfectly balanced total weekly workload.  We analyzed the complexity and established heuristic techniques for well-balanced schedules with worst-case guarantees.  The effectiveness of these techniques are confirmed by computational results on real-life and artificial data.</br>
