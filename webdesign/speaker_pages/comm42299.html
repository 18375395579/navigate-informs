<br>Title: The Role of Research in Containerization at Matson</br><br>Author: Lloyd Yates, Consultant, 200 Molino Avenue, Mill Valley, CA, 94941, United States, macyates1@mac.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The Research Department established by Matson Navigation in 1956 was the first among steamship companies.  The initial objective of the research program was to evaluate the economic potential of containerizing cargo in their West Coast ?Hawaii service.  After detailed study the Research Department recommended a two-phase implementation and projected high financial returns.  In 1957 the Matson Board of Directors approved implementing the first phase.  The first vessel sailed with containers in August 1958.  Resounding success of the pioneering effort in Pacific cargo transportation led to a program to fully convert all containerizable cargo to containers.  This summary will also report on initial efforts of other US flag carriers in the US and world markets.</br>
