Title: Optimally Locating Military Healthcare Virtualization Resources<br>Author: Ayse Parlak, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, aip6@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Kharoufeh, Rusty Baldwin, Rocky Reston<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present integer programming models for optimally locating application virtualization hosting environments (AVHEs) at remote access sites across the military healthcare system. Considered are two objectives: (1) minimizing the total expected response time experienced by geographically-distributed users, (2) maximizing the probability that the response time at any site does not exceed a pre-specified threshold, subject to bandwidth and stability constraints.
