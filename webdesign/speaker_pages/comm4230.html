Title: Filtered Likelihood for Point Processes<br>Author: Gustavo Schwenkler, Stanford University, 1045 Alma St, Palo Alto, CA, 94301, United States of America, gschwenk@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kay Giesecke<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop likelihood estimators of the parameters of a marked point process and of incompletely observed explanatory factors that influence the arrival intensity. The factors follow arbitrary jump-diffusions. We provide conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality as the sample period grows. We also establish an approximation to the likelihood and analyze the convergence and asymptotic properties of the associated estimators. Numerical results illustrate our approach.
