Agents are more inclined to communicate with those who hold similar opinions, but are also attracted to popular individuals. This system exhibits strong correlation over time and is difficult to analyze. Regardless, we show that it converges to a consensus, describe the role of popular agents, give bounds on the speed of convergence, and characterize that opinion for large societies.</br>
