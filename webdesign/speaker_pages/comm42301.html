Title: Integrality Gaps for Sherali-Adams Relaxations<br>Author: Yury Makarychev, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052, United States of America, yurym@microsoft.com<br>Coauthor(s): Konstantin Makarychev, Moses Charikar<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We prove strong lower bounds for Sherali–Adams relaxations of the MAX CUT, Vertex Cover and Sparsest Cut problems. Specifically, we show that the integrality gap of MAX CUT and Vertex Cover relaxations is 2 - epsilon after n^delta rounds (where delta depends on epsilon);  the integrality gap of Sparsest Cut is at least max(sqrt{log n / (log r + log log n)}, log n / (r + log log n)).
