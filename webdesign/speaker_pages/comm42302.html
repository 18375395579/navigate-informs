<br>Title: The ICU Will See You Now: Efficient-Equitable Admission Policies</br><br>Author: Muer Yang, Assistant Professor, University of St. Thomas, 1000 LaSalle Avenue, SCH 435, Minneapolis, MN, 55403, United States of America, yangmuer@stthomas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Fry, Corey Scurlock</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Intensive care units (ICU) are frequently the bottleneck in a hospital system. We examine admission policies for a surgical ICU where patients arrive in batches, with the objective of balancing system efficiency and equity. We propose a simple and efficient heuristic solution method that provides a performance guarantee. We also apply our admissions policy to a real cardiothoracic-surgical ICU setting.</br>
