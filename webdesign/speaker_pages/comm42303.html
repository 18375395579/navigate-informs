Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of installing sensors on arcs in a network in order to minimize a smuggler's maximum probability of traversing from a known origin to a known destination without being detected.  We develop an class of inequalities that produces the convex hull for the case when sensor installations are restricted to arcs in a predefined cut-set.  These inequalities may be useful in solving a generalized version of this problem in which the smuggler's origin and destination are unknown.</br>
