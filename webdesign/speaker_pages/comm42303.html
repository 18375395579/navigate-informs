Title: Convex Hull Representation of the Bipartite Max-Reliability Path Interdiction Problem<br>Author: Kelly Sullivan, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, 1 University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, kmsullivan@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Morton, J. Cole Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of installing sensors on arcs in a network in order to minimize a smuggler's maximum probability of traversing from a known origin to a known destination without being detected.  We develop an class of inequalities that produces the convex hull for the case when sensor installations are restricted to arcs in a predefined cut-set.  These inequalities may be useful in solving a generalized version of this problem in which the smuggler's origin and destination are unknown.
