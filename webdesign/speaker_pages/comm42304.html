<br>Title: Overflow Models with Many-servers: Transient and Steady-state Analysis</br><br>Author: Itay Gurvich, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, i-gurvich@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by call-center outsourcing problems, we consider large-scale service systems with multiple customer classes and multiple agent pools operating under an overflow mechanism. We establish transient and steady-state approximations in the Quality and Efficiency Driven (QED) heavy-traffic regime. In particular, we prove an asymptotic independence result that leads to simplified expressions for the waiting time distribution and can be used in the design of outsourcing contracts.</br>
