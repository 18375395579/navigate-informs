Based on some nonparametric upper and lower bounds of the loss probability, two fractional functions are minimized where the numerator includes VaR or CVaR while the denominator is a norm of the portfolio vector. This also implies that the short-sale constraint brings a theoretical underpinning to the ordinary VaR and CVaR minimizations. Some computational results demonstrate its promising performance.
