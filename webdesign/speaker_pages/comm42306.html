<br>Title: Improving Portfolio Performance via VaR/CVaR Minimization: A Statistical Learning Approach</br><br>Author: Jun-ya Gotoh, Associate Professor, Chuo University, 1-13-27 Kasuga, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 112-8551, Japan, jgoto@indsys.chuo-u.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Akiko Takeda</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A new portfolio optimization approach is proposed for improving the out-of-sample performance. Based on some nonparametric upper and lower bounds of the loss probability, two fractional functions are minimized where the numerator includes VaR or CVaR while the denominator is a norm of the portfolio vector. This also implies that the short-sale constraint brings a theoretical underpinning to the ordinary VaR and CVaR minimizations. Some computational results demonstrate its promising performance.</br>
