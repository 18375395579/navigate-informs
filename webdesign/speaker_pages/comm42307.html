Title: A Replenishment Policy for Perishable Products Based on Estimated Aging and Retrieval<br>Author: Karel van Donselaar, TU Eindhoven, P.O. Box 513 Pav E03, Eindhoven, NB, 5600 MB, Netherlands, K.H.v.Donselaar@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Rob Broekmeulen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Due to new information technologies like RFID, it now becomes economically feasible to register the age of the inventory in the system. We suggest a replenishment policy for perishable products which takes into account the age of inventories and which requires only very simple calculations. It will be shown that in a real-life retail environment, this new policy leads to substantial cost reductions compared with a base policy that does not take into account the age of inventories.
