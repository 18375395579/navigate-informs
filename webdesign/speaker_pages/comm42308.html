Title: Lane-based Evacuation Route Planning for Two Heterogeneous Flows<br>Author: Amani Saleh, Inustrial Engineer- Ph.D Student, University of Central Florida, 530 Buckingham Rd. #1031, Richardson, TX, 75081, United States of America, asaleh@mail.ucf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Geiger<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In emergency situations, at least flows occur almost simultaneously ?the flow of evacuees from a hazard area to areas of safety and the flow of emergency first responders to the impacted areas. These two flows are incompatible, traversing a transportation network with lane-based roads and intersection merge and cross points. The route planning problem is viewed as a max flow problem and formulated as an integer linear program. Experimental results for a specific geographical area are presented.
