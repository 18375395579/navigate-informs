Title: Nonnegative Pareto-improving Tolls with Multiclass Network Equilibrium<br>Author: Ziqi Song, University of Florida, Weil Hall 508, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, ziqi@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin, Siriphong Lawphongpanich<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This study considers nonnegative Pareto-improving toll vectors that improve the social benefit without making anyone worse off in a network with multiple user classes. Since requiring tolls to be nonnegative and anonymous may not be feasible in all cases, the existence conditions for such toll vectors are discussed.
