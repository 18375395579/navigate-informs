Title: Order Batching and Vehicle Selection in a Parallel-aisle Warehouse with Time-Constraints<br>Author: Soondo Hong, PhD Student, Dept. of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University, 241 Zachry, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, hongs@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brett Peters<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a small-item order batching model in a parallel-aisle warehouse with multiple constraints and vehicles.  An order picker repeatedly travels and collects orders with fixed cycle time and capacity limit.  A branch-and-price algorithm is developed for selecting vehicle technologies and batching orders to minimize the total picking time using the S-shape strategy.
