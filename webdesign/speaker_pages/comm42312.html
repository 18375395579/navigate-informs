Title: Minimum Concave Cost Network Flow over a Grid Network<br>Author: Qie He, Georgia Tech ISyE, 765 Ferst Dr NW, atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, qie.he@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Ahmed, George Nemhauser<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the minimum cost flow problem over a grid network with a general nonnegative separable concave cost function, which generalizes the lot-sizing problem by allowing multiple sources in the network. We show that the problem is polynomially solvable with one echelon of sources and two echelons of sinks. The analysis relies on an inflow formula of any node under all extreme points of the feasible set, which generalizes Zangwill's result (1969) for the multi-echelon lot-sizing problem.
