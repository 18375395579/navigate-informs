Title: The (Q,r) Model for Perishables with Multiple Outstanding Orders<br>Author: Emre Berk, Assistant Professor, Bilkent University, Faculty of Business Administration, Ankara, Turkey, eberk@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We analyze the lost sales (Q,r) model for perishables with constant leadtimes/lifetimes when there may be more than one outstanding   order. We employ an embedded MC approach and obtain operating   characteristics of inventory system via an effective shelflife distribution.   We establish some stochastic properties of the system and present numerical results.
