<br>Title: Selecting a Portfolio of Network Attack Response Plans</br><br>Author: Christian Klaus, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Road, Monterey, United States of America, cklaus@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nedialko Dimitrov</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Consider a tri-level defender-attacker-defender problem: (1) A defender picks m paths from a source to a sink in a network. (2) An attacker removes n arcs from the network. (3) The defender moves from the source to the sink, using the shortest non-attacked path from his initial portfolio. We call this the m-n-shortest paths problem. Even the simplest such problem, the 2-1-SP, is NP-complete. We create a computationally tractable method of addressing the problem and some of its generalizations.</br>
