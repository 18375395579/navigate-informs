Title: Closed-form Expansions of Discretely Monitored Asian Options in Diffusion Models<br>Author: Chao Shi, Mr, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Room 002C, UA TOWER A, HKUST, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, shichao@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Ning Cai, Chenxu Li<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a closed-form asymptotic expansion approach to pricing discretely monitored Asian options in general one-dimensional diffusion models. It explicitly calculates any general expansion term in a systematic way. The convergence of the expansion is proved rigorously under some regularity conditions. Numerical experiments suggest that such expansion with only a few terms is accurate, fast, and easy to implement for a broad range of diffusion models.
