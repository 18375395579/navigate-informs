<br>Title: Analysis of Online Stochastic Routing Approaches under Real-time Information</br><br>Author: Lili Du, Purdue University, Nextrans Center, 3000 Kent Avenue, W Lafayette, IN, 47906-1075, ldu@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta, Yong Hoon Kim</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This study develops online stochastic routing policies/algorithms incorporating real-time short-term link travel time distributions and travelers?preferences on travel time and its variability. Numerical experiments are illustrated to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches as well as the impacts of real-time information accuracy on the online stochastic routing.</br>
