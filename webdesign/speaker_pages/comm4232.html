Title: Limit Theorems for a Shortest Remaining Processing Time Queue<br>Author: Amber Puha, Department of Mathematics, Cal State San Marcos, San Marcos, CA, 92096, United States of America, apuha@csusm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christian Gromoll<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Consider a GI/GI/1 queue operating under shortest remaining processing time with preemption.  To describe the evolution of this system,  we use a measure valued process that keeps track of the residual service times of all jobs in the system at any given time.  We propose measure valued fluid and diffusion models for this systems.  Under mild assumptions, we present limit theorems justifying the fluid and diffusion models as approximations for the SRPT queue.
