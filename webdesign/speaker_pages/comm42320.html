This presentation investigates the criticality analysis for degrading components under dynamic environmental conditions. The component degradation is modeled by a k-dimensional Wiener process, and component fails when any of these k degradation paths attains its own threshold level. In the numerical examples, we illustrate the computation of component criticality in different system configurations.
