<br>Title: Criticality Index for Degrading Components under Dynamic Environments</br><br>Author: Xiao Liu, Qatar University, Male Library, Room 103, Doha, 2713, Qatar, liuxiaodnn_1@hotmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Khalifa N.

This presentation investigates the criticality analysis for degrading components under dynamic environmental conditions. The component degradation is modeled by a k-dimensional Wiener process, and component fails when any of these k degradation paths attains its own threshold level. In the numerical examples, we illustrate the computation of component criticality in different system configurations.</br>
