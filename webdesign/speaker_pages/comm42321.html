Title: One-switch Utility Independence for Multiattribute Utility Functions<br>Author: Ali Abbas, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61820, United States of America, aliabbas@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Bell<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A decision maker with a utility function, U(x,y), faces two uncertain lotteries over attribute X (at a fixed value of attribute Y). For example he may face two uncertain lotteries over wealth at a given health state. If his preferences between the lotteries can change only once as we vary Y, we say he has one-switch utility independence of X on Y, X 1S Y. If, in addition, Y 1S X, we say he has symmetric one-switch independence. We derive the relevant functional forms for U.
