Title: On Polynomial Cases of the Unichain Classification Problem for Markov Decision Processes<br>Author: Eugene Feinberg, Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, 11794, United States of America, efeinberg@notes.cc.sunysb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fenghsu Yang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The unichain classification problem detects whether a finite state and action MDP is unichain under all deterministic policies.  As shown by John Tsitsiklis, this problem is NP-hard.  This paper provides polynomial algorithms for the unichain classification for an MDP with either a state that is recurrent under all deterministic policies or with a state that is absorbing under some action.
