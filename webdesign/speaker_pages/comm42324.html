Title: Machine Scheduling Problems in the Presence of Highly Variable Resource Demands<br>Author: Ana Radovanovic, Research Scientist, Google Inc., 76 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY, 10011, United States of America, anaradovanovic@google.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We observe a scheduling problem where a stream of different types of users arrive to the system requesting resources (cpu, ram, disk) for some random amount of time. User requests are served by a single, assigned available machine from the large pool. Our goal is to design a dynamic scheduling policy that performs well, i.e., minimizes job loss rate due to system's inability to provide resources, in the presence of highly variable users' demand.
