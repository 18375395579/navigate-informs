<br>Title: An Integrated Approach to the Design of Statistically Precise and Energy Efficient Accelerated Tests</br><br>Author: Haitao Liao, Associate Professor, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, hliao@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Zhang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, an integrated experimental design approach is introduced with the objective of maximizing the reliability estimation precision while minizing the energy consumption of an accelerated test. Relevant statistical inference methods and required experimental needs and technologies are discussed.</br>
