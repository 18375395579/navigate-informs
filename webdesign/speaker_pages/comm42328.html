Title: Alternative Transportation Fuels: Modeling National-Scale Ethanol Production and Distribution<br>Author: Scott Matthews, Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 15213, United States, hsm@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Griffin, William R. Morrow<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Crude oil refining and gasoline distribution have been optimized over time. Ethanol is currently a niche market. Our LP model estimates the logistics costs associated with national ethanol production and distribution from biomass. We estimate higher downstream transportation costs than gasoline (15-48 cents compared to 3 cents per gallon) but remain a fraction of total cost at blends up to 16% ethanol. Total infrastructure constraints could make large-scale ethanol distribution infeasible.
