Title: Modeling Network Transition Constraints with Hypergraphs<br>Author: Steven Harrod, Dr., University of Dayton, Department of MIS, OM, & DS, 300 College Park, Dayton, OH, 45469, United States of America, steven.harrod@udayton.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Discrete time dynamic graphs are frequently used to model multicommodity flows or activity paths through constrained resources, but simple graphs fail to capture the interaction effects of resource transitions. A hypergraph formulation is derived to address railway network sequencing constraints, and an experimental problem sample solved to estimate the magnitude of objective inflation when interaction effects are ignored.
