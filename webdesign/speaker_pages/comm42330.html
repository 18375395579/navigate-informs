Title: Inventory Policies, Costs and Risks in Master Production Scheduling with Explicit Demand Uncertainty<br>Author: Keli Feng, Assistant Professor, South Carolina State University, 300 college street, NE, Orangeburg, SC, 29118, United States of America, kfeng1@scsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Uday Rao<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: For a single-item MPS with capacity limits and dynamic uncertain demand (mean, forecast error), we consider planning using an order quantity vector or order-up-to levels. Performance measures include service levels, cost (mean, standard deviation, c.v.), expected upside risk, “cost-at-risk? and probability of exceeding a target cost. Using simulation-based optimization, we computationally explore the impact of parameters such as shortage penalty, demand c.v., capacity utilization.
