In constant-stress ALT, a unit is tested at a fixed stress level while step-stress ALT allows increasing stress levels at pre-fixed time points. In this talk, optimal k-level constant-stress and step stress ALT are compared for exponential distribution under time constraint. The objective is to quantify the advantage of step-stress ALT relative to constant-stress one.</br>
