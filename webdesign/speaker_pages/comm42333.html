Jobs visit station 1, a polling station   that employs exhaustive service and incurs no setup time, and then   station 2, which has an arbitrary non-idling service discipline.  We   prove that although the sequence of diffusion-scaled, immediate   workload processes for station 2 does not converge in general, the   sequence does in fact admit an averaging principle.</br>
