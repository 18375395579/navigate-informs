Title: Characterization of Optimal Strategy for Multi Asset Investment/Consumption with Transaction Costs<br>Author: Min Dai, Associate Professor, National University of Singapore, Department of Mathematics, Singapore, Singapore, matdm@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Xinfu Chen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the optimal consumption and investment with transaction costs on multiple assets, where the prices of risky assets jointly follow a multi-dimensional geometric Brownian motion. We characterize the optimal investment strategy and in particular show that the trading region has the shape that is very much needed for well defining the trading strategy, e.g., the no-trading region has distinct corners.
