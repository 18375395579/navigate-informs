Title: Tractable Optimization Subject to Service Level Constraints<br>Author: Assaf Zeevi, Professor, Columbia Business School, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, assaf@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a simple and tractable approach to optimizing service centers ' capacity planning decisions, subject to service level constraints. A salient feature of the proposed approach is that it allows to deal with   uncertainty in the basic model primitives (such as demand volume and other business drivers).
