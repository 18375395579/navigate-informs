Title: Integrated Dynamic Multi-modal Traffic Assignment<br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E 2nd St. Room 206, Department of Civil Eng.and Eng. Mech., Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, chiu@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hickman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present the developments of an integrated simulation-based multi-modal traffic assignment approach. The integrated approach consists of the passenger-oriented mesoscopic multi-modal traffic simulation model, the assignment of transit passengers to transit stops and routes based on time-dependent shortest paths in the transit network based on both origin-destination travel times (including trip time, walk time and wait time) as well as service reliability in the transit network.
