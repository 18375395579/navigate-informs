Title: Small Worlds by Design<br>Author: Donald P. Gaver, Professor Emeritus of Operations Research, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, United States of America, dgaver@nps.org<br>Coauthor(s): Patricia Jacobs<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A large group (size n) of entities is to be linked together efficiently. Forming optimal subgroups, size O(n^(1/3))  each with one representative, and representatives in higher subgroup, total connections is O(n^( 4/3)) so efficiency of two levels over one is O(n^(2/3)). Further efficiency can be achieved.
