Title: Domain Protection Methodologies<br>Author: Donald Gaver, Distinguished Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, DGaver@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): K.C. Chng, Patricia Jacobs<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: An important domain (e.g. straits towards a Blue seaport) contains many benign(White)usually-friendly vessels; it is transited by fewer possibly dangerous (e.g. LNG) ships aimed to cause port damage. We analyze requirements and CONOPS for Blue defense forces: UAVs, USVs, Helos, and Patrol Craft, to minimize port damage.
