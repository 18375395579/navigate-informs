Chng, Patricia Jacobs</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: An important domain (e.g. straits towards a Blue seaport) contains many benign(White)usually-friendly vessels; it is transited by fewer possibly dangerous (e.g. LNG) ships aimed to cause port damage. We analyze requirements and CONOPS for Blue defense forces: UAVs, USVs, Helos, and Patrol Craft, to minimize port damage.</br>
