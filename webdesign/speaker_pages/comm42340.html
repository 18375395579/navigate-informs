Title: Joint Optimization of Virtual Capacities and Bid-Prices for Revenue Management<br>Author: Gustavo Vulcano, Associate Professor, Leonard N.

The controller sets a virtual capacity and a bid-price for each of the legs at the beginning of the finite horizon, and takes reservations. At the end of the horizon, the effective capacities and customer show-ups are realized. The controller incurs a penalty cost for each bumped reservation. We present a stochastic gradient algorithm for the adjusted revenue maximization problem (revenue minus penalty cost).
