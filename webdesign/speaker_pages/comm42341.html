Title: Structured Maintenance Policies on Interior Sample Paths<br>Author: Lisa Maillart, Assistant Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, maillart@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ludmila Zheltova<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine the problem of adaptively scheduling perfect observations  and preventive replacements for a multi-state, Markovian deterioration system such that total expected discounted cost is minimized. We model this problem as a partially observed Markov decision process and show that the structural properties of the optimal policy hold for certain non-extreme sample paths.  Several variations of the basic problem structure are also discussed.
