Title: Optimal Design of Hydrogen Storage Facilities Under Supply and Demand Uncertainties<br>Author: Yueyue Fan, Assistant Professor, University of California, Department of CEE, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, yyfan@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yongxi Huang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The process of producing hydrogen from biomass involves seasonal fluctuation of feedstock supply and highly uncertain future demand.  In this work, we propose a multistage stochastic model for optimal design of the storage facilities and their operating schedules, to improve the economics and reliability of the entire energy supply chain.
