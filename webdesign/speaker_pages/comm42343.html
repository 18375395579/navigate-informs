Title: Interactive Line Balancing and Workcell Layout in an Automotive Assembly Environment<br>Author: Erica Klampfl, Infotronics & Systems Analytics Department, Ford Motor Company, RIC Building, MD #2122, 2101 Village Road, Dearborn, MI, 48124, United States, eklampfl@ford.com<br>Coauthor(s): Oleg Gusikhin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Mixed-model assembly lines enable building different vehicles using the same equipment and facility: this creates significant challenges regarding assembly line planning and balancing. Existing methods for line balancing assume that the time required to complete a set of tasks is independent of the cell assignment and layout.  We present a method for interactive line balancing and workcell layout, so that non-value added operations (e.g. walking & waiting) and workload variations are minimized.
