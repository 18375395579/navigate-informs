<br>Title: Bargaining for Resources in Large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks</br><br>Author: Abhijit Deshmukh, Program Director, NSF, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA, 22230, United States, adeshmuk@nsf.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Middelkoop</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Wireless sensor networks pose interesting challenges when coordination between sensors is required. This talk presents a bargaining protocol designed specifically for resource coordination in distributed sensor networks.  This talk will present the bargaining market formulation, characterize the equilibrium solution and present computational results for a large-scale wireless sensor network.</br>
