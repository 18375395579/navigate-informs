Title: Airline Scheduling in Competitive Markets<br>Author: Luis Cadarso, Technical University of Madrid, Aeronautics School, Pza.

We develop a mixed-integer linear optimization model in order to determine an optimal flight schedule and fleet assignment for an airline operating in competitive markets. The market share is estimated by a piecewise linear approximation of the logistic curve. The objective is to maximize airline profitability. We assume that the strategy from the rest of operators is known. An application of the model for a simplified IBERIA (the major Spanish airline) network is shown.
