Title: Online Production Planning and Information Purchase to Maximize on-Time Orders<br>Author: Nicholas Hall, Professor, Ohio State University, 2100 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, United States of America, hall.33@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chris Potts, Marc Posner<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a two period production planning problem. In the first period full information is known; new orders are available in the second period. The objective is to maximize the proportion of on-time orders. We describe an efficient algorithm with asymptotically best possible performance that depends on the relative period lengths. We study the sensitivity of performance to the decision maker's choices. We describe an algorithm that makes asymptotically optimal use of purchased information.
