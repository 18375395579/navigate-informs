Title: Discretizing Vehicle Routing Zones for Large-Scale Distribution Systems with Customer Uncertainty<br>Author: Yanfeng Ouyang, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N. Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, yfouyang@uiuc.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper proposes algorithms to automatically discretize vehicle routing zones (VRZ) from continuum approximation guidelines (i.e., shape and size requirements). VRZs are useful to the planning and operation of distribution systems in several practical contexts. We utilize a combination of spatial partitioning techniques to systematically obtain optimum zone designs that conform to the guidelines.
