Title: Social Learning with Network Uncertainty<br>Author: Evan Sadler, New York University, Stern Business, New York, NY, United States of America, esadler@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ilan Lobel<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We construct a sequential model of social learning in complex networks and examine the perfect Bayesian equilibria of this model.  In contrast to prior models in which the neighborhoods of agents are independent of each other, we consider arbitrary network topologies and show that prior characterizations of conditions under which learning occurs fail. We give new characterizations that offer insights on new phenomena that can occur in complex networks.
