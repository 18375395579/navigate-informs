Title: Analyzing the Progression from Single to Double Track Using Simulation Techniques<br>Author: Samuel L. Sogin, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N Matthews B118, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, ssogin2@illinois.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Much of the railway network is single track. Freight and passenger traffic is expected to increase requiring additional capacity. The funding for the complete second track may not be available all at once. This track may be phased in over time as funding becomes available. These analyses use simulation to define the operating characteristics of these hybrid track configurations. These results will facilitate the development of an optimal incremental upgrade model for capacity expansion.
