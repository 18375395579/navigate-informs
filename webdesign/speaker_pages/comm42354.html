Instead of assuming that demand points are either covered or not covered at all, we allow partial coverage where the coverage level is a function of distance. The objective of the problem is to locate a facility so as to maximize the probability that the total covered demand weight is beyond a pre-selected threshold value. The problem is shown to be NP-hard and an exact solution procedure and a heuristic are suggested.
