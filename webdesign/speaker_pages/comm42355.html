Title: Value of Perfect Weather Information in the Probabilistic Air Traffic Management<br>Author: Yoonjin Yoon, Assistant Professor, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Dept of CEE, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong gu, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of, yoonjin@kaist.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In our previous study, we modeled a stochastic optimization of single-aircraft routing decision problem as a Geometric Recourse Model (GRM) during a weather disruption. In this paper, we utilize the same geometric setup to assess of the value of perfect weather information in probabilistic routing decision problem by solving both the stochastic GRM and the GRM with known clearance time. The results show that improvement with better weather information is limited with maximum saving of 10%.
