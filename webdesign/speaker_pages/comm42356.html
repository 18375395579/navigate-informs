Title: Optimal Stopping and Early Exercise: An Eigenfunction Expansion Approach<br>Author: Lingfei Li, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong - PRC, lingfeili2012@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Linetsky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose an eigenfunction expansion approach to solve discrete time finite and infinite horizon optimal stopping problems for symmetric Markov processes, which cover many models used in practice. We illustrate this approach with some real option applications.
