Title: Approximation Algorithms for Generalized Hypergraph Matching Problems<br>Author: Ojas Parekh, Senior Member Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, MS 1326, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States of America, odparek@sandia.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Dave Pritchard<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We examine two generalizations of the matching problem on hypergraphs with sets of size at most k. Our first result is a (k-1+1/k)-approximation for b-matching on k-hypergraphs, settling the integrality gap of the natural LP relaxation.  Our second result is for demand matching on k-hypergraphs. Previously a 2k-approximation was known via iterative packing, and we show that a much simpler and faster local ratio algorithm gives the same result.
