Title: Approximations for the Waiting Time Distribution in an M/G/1 Queue<br>Author: Mariana Olvera-Cravioto, Columbia University, 500 W. 120th Street, Rm. 306, New York, NY, United States of America, molvera@ieor.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter W. Glynn, Jose Blanchet<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider an M/G/1 queue with heavy-tailed processing times. Our results provide new approximations for the steady-state waiting time that are uniform in the traffic intensity, and from which one can easily recover both the heavy-traffic and heavy-tailed approximations by looking at appropriate combinations of the traffic intensity and tail values. These approximations also explain the transition from an exponentially decaying tail (heavy-traffic) to a subexponential one (heavy-tail).
