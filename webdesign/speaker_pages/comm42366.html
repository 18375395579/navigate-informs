Srikant, Loc Bui</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The model is a queueing network shared by a number of   multicast sessions, each with a single sender and multiple receivers. Key feature: receivers (even within same session)  may have different (concave) utility functions of the average received rate. We present a joint scheduling and congestion control algorithm, asymptotically maximizing the total utility.</br>
