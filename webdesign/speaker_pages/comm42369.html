Title: Incremental Capacity Expansion ?Heavier Loads, Faster Empties and Quicker Meets<br>Author: Hans Boysen, Researcher, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Dept. of Transport Science, Traffic and Logistics, Stockholm, SE-10044, Sweden, heboysen@kth.se<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: To meet growing demand, a study is being done on measures to raise transportation capacity, including increased tonnage per loaded train using the existing locomotives, higher return speed for empty trains, and quicker meets.  Results show that for a trailing tonnage increase of some 19 %, the longer loading, transit and unloading times would be more than recovered by raising the empty return speed by some 10 km/h.  Simultaneous entry to meets will further raise capacity and reduce cycle time.
