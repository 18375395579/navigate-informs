Title: A Model to Assist in Selecting Bid Prices in the Truckload Market<br>Author: Keith Ware, OR Manager, UPS, 1400 N. Hurstbourne Pkwy, Louisville, KY, 40242, United States of America, kware@ups.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: When truckload carriers develop bid prices, they want to leverage their existing transportation network to reduce their costs and submit a very competitive bid. However, the demands that make up the network are stochastic and the exact timing of any particular move is not known until 24 hours before it actually occurs. We describe a spreadsheet model using Monte Carlo techniques and a series of min cost network flow models to assist a carrier during the price setting process.
