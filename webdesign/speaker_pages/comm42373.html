Title: Approximation Balancing Policies for Inventory Systems with Remanufacturing<br>Author: Sean Zhou, CUHK, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, zhoux@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Zhijie Tao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a single-product periodic-review inventory system with remanufacturable returned products. Demand and returns follow some general stochastic processes and may be correlated, non-stationary and evolving across different periods. We propose an approximation algorithm for computing manufacturing and remanufacturing quantities in each period and show that the expected cost under this approximation policy is at most twice of the optimal one.
