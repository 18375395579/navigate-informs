Demand and returns follow some general stochastic processes and may be correlated, non-stationary and evolving across different periods. We propose an approximation algorithm for computing manufacturing and remanufacturing quantities in each period and show that the expected cost under this approximation policy is at most twice of the optimal one.</br>
