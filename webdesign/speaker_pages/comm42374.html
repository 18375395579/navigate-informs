This can be interpreted as a zero-sum controller-stopper game in which the stopper is trying to maximize its pay-off while an adverse player wants to minimize this payoff by choosing an evaluation criteria. We show that  the first time   when the reward process  meets its the upper Snell envelope is the optimal stopping time for the robust optimal stopping problem.</br>
