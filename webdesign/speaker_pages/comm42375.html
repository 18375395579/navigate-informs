Title: Approximation Algorithms for Bi-criteria Scheduling with Machine Assignment Cost<br>Author: Kangbok Lee, Research Associate Professor, Rutgers University, Business School, Piscataway, NJ, United States of America, kangblee@business.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Leung, Michael Pinedo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a bi-criteria parallel machine scheduling problem in which the first objective is to minimize the makespan for the total completion time and the second objective is to minimize the maximum machine cost or the total machine cost. We propose fast heuristics and establish their worst-case performance bounds.
