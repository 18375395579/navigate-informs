Solving this problem requires addressing two main challenges: (a) predicting demand for new and existing items in response to the new product introduction, and (b) finding the optimal assortment in response to the demand predictions. We propose a new approach to predicting demand and an associated algorithm for assortment optimization. We report results on real-world supermarket transaction logs.</br>
