Title: Nash-Cournot Equilibrium Problems under Uncertainty: Solution Properties and Scalable Algorithms<br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Asst.

The resulting dynamic game is often referred to as an S-adapted open-loop equilibrium problem. We provide existence and uniqueness results for such games, as well as their generalizations. A scalable Newton-splitting method is suggested for solving such a class of problems.
