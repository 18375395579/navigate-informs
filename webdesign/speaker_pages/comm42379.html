Title: Degree Bounded Network Design in Directed Graphs<br>Author: Viswanath Nagarajan, viswa@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nikhil Bansal, Rohit Khandekar<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: An arborescence in a directed graph with a specified root is a minimal subgraph that contains a path from the root to each vertex. In the minimum degree arborescence problem, given a rooted directed graph, the goal is to find an arborescence that minimizes its maximum out-degree. This problem is NP-hard even in the undirected case. We give an algorithm for this problem that obtains an arborescence having degree at most 2 more than the optimal. This can be extended to more general connectivity.
