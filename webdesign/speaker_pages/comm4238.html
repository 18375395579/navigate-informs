Title: Solving Maximum Flows in O(nm) Time, and Less<br>Author: James Orlin, Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, E62-570, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, jorlin@MIT.EDU<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Over the past 30 years, researchers have developed successively faster algorithms for the maximum flow problem.  The best strongly polynomial time algorithms have come very close to O(nm) time. Many researchers have conjectured that O(nm) time is the true best running time.  We resolve the issue in two ways.  First, we show how to solve the max flow problem in O(nm) time.  Second, we show that the running time is even better if m = O(n).  In this case, the running time is O(n^2 / log n).
