The best strongly polynomial time algorithms have come very close to O(nm) time. Many researchers have conjectured that O(nm) time is the true best running time.  We resolve the issue in two ways.  First, we show how to solve the max flow problem in O(nm) time.  Second, we show that the running time is even better if m = O(n).  In this case, the running time is O(n^2 / log n).</br>
