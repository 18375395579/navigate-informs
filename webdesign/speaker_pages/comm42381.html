Title: Cargo Driven Container Logistics: A Cross-Docking Facility Location Problem with Economies of Scale<br>Author: Yann Bouchery, Eindhoven University of Technology, P.O.

In our research, we explore how cross-docking may improve flow consolidation by focusing on the cargo inside the containers. We thus propose a cross-docking facility location problem for container logistics in a hub-and-spoke network. Moreover, we model flow dependent economies of scale both for transportation and for cross-docking operations.
