Title: Online Dynamic Capacity Provisioning in Data Centers<br>Author: Minghong Lin, Caltech, 1200 E.

In this work, we study how to avoid such waste via an online dynamic capacity provisioning. We show that the optimal offline algorithm has a simple structure when viewed in reverse time, and develop a lazy online algorithm which is 3-competitive. Additionally, we analyze the traditional receding horizon control and introduce a new variant.
