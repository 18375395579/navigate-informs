Title: Decentralized Control Policies for Large-Scale Vehicle Sharing Systems<br>Author: David George, Operations Research Analyst, Monsanto Company, Maryland Heights, MO, 63146, United States of America, david.k.george@monsanto.com<br>Coauthor(s): Cathy Xia<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: With the increasing scale and complexity of today's vehicle sharing systems, centralized approaches for their management tend to be impractical. In this research, we present a decentralized approach, based on a closed queueing network model, for maintaining balanced vehicle inventories across the network. In addition to decisions of vehicle repositioning and customer admission, our decentralized solution suggests a mechanism for the dynamic pricing of vehicle rentals based on network congestion.
