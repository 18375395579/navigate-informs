Title: Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Large Interacting Stochastic Systems<br>Author: Justin Sirignano, Stanford University, 3 Gibbs Court, Irvine, CA, United States of America, jasirign@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kay Giesecke, Gustavo Schwenkler<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Parameter estimation for a large system is facilitated by using the asymptotic SPDE to which the system weakly converges as well as a conditionally Gaussian first-order correction.  We develop a particle filtering method for the asymptotic SPDEs.  Theoretical convergence of the finite system's likelihood to the asymptotic likelihood is discussed.  Important credit risk and mortgage applications motivate the method.
