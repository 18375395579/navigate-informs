Title: Facility Location Design for Large Scale Energy Storage Devices<br>Author: Yong Liang, PhD Candidate, University of California-Berkeley, Etcheverry Hall 1117, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, yongliang@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Z. Max Shen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Recently there has been growing interest in large-scale electricity storage facilities. In this talk, we construct a model to formulate the problem of selecting locations and sizes of the storage facilities. The objective is to minimize the upfront construction costs plus the long-run operation costs. We also conduct analysis on minimizing the worst cast costs when there are uncertainties associated with the locational marginal pricing and local demands.
