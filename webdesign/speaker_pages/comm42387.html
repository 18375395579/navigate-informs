Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recently there has been growing interest in large-scale electricity storage facilities. In this talk, we construct a model to formulate the problem of selecting locations and sizes of the storage facilities. The objective is to minimize the upfront construction costs plus the long-run operation costs. We also conduct analysis on minimizing the worst cast costs when there are uncertainties associated with the locational marginal pricing and local demands.</br>
