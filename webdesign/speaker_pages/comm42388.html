Title: Stochastic Networks with Breakdowns: Effective Control of Flexible Servers<br>Author: Soroush Saghafian, PhD Student, University of Michigan, Industrial & Operations Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, soroush@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bora Kolfal, Mark Van Oyen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The optimal control (scheduling) of flexible servers subject to breakdown in a parallel queueing network is a theoretically interesting and practical problem which we model as a MDP.   We present structural properties for interesting special cases in pursuit of principles for effective management of problems within this broad class.
