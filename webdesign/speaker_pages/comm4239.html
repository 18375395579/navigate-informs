Title: Transportation of Milk to Dairies Using Trailers<br>Author: Arne Løkketangen, Professor, Molde University College, Britveien 2, Molde, -, 6411, Norway, Arne.Lokketangen@hiMolde.no<br>Coauthor(s): Arild Hoff<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We address the problem of transportation of milk from farmers to dairies in rural Norway. Due to accessibility restrictions, the hangers are prohibited from entering the farms, and must be parked at designated spots. Milk is then collected by the main vehicle and then pumped to the trailer. We report from tests on real-world instances.
