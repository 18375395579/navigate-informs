Title: Indirect Elicitation of MCDA Sorting Models using Valued Assignment Examples<br>Author: Olivier Cailloux, École Centrale Paris, Grande Voie des Vignes, Châtenay-Malabry, 92295, France, olivier.cailloux@ecp.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Brice Mayag, Vincent Mousseau, Luis Dias<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose an elicitation method for learning MCDA sorting functions. Such a function assigns each alternative from a set of alternatives, evaluated on multiple criteria, to a category in a set of preference ordered categories. Our input is a set of assignment examples where each example contains several possible destination categories for an alternative, each associated with a credibility. We deduce several sorting functions whose precision depend on the chosen credibility level.
