Such a function assigns each alternative from a set of alternatives, evaluated on multiple criteria, to a category in a set of preference ordered categories. Our input is a set of assignment examples where each example contains several possible destination categories for an alternative, each associated with a credibility. We deduce several sorting functions whose precision depend on the chosen credibility level.</br>
