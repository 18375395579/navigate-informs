Title: Resource Allocation in Grid Computing<br>Author: Rhonda Righter, Professor, UC Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, United States, rrighter@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ger Koole<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider task replication for grid computing, and show that under fairly mild and often reasonable conditions, maximal task replication stochastically maximizes the number of task completions by any time.  Maximal task replication is also robust.
