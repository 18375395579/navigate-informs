Grant St., West Lafayette, IN, United States, chenp@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dulcy Abraham, Mark Lawley<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Our research analytically tests the hypothesis that aggregating hospital inventories through a mutual aid agreement mechanism in a pandemic influenza scenario can lower the probability of short-term stock-out among the participating facilities. Furthermore, this work will focus on finding the optimal stockpile levels and ordering policies of a single critical item in individual hospitals with minimum or minimum acceptable shortage.
