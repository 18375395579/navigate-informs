<br>Title: The Impact of Hospital Mutual Aid Agreements on Emergency Stockpiling</br><br>Author: Po-Ching DeLaurentis, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant St., West Lafayette, IN, United States, chenp@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dulcy Abraham, Mark Lawley</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Our research analytically tests the hypothesis that aggregating hospital inventories through a mutual aid agreement mechanism in a pandemic influenza scenario can lower the probability of short-term stock-out among the participating facilities. Furthermore, this work will focus on finding the optimal stockpile levels and ordering policies of a single critical item in individual hospitals with minimum or minimum acceptable shortage.</br>
