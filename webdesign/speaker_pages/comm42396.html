Title: Implementing High-powered Contracts to Motivate Intertemporal Effort Supply<br>Author: Leon Yang Chu, Department of Information and Operations Management, University of Southern California, CA, United States of America, leonyzhu@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Sappington<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We characterize the optimal contract between a principal and a risk-neutral, wealth-constrained agent whose information about the operating environment improves over time. The optimal contract in this setting often is more steeply-sloped for the largest output levels compared to the classic models. The large incremental rewards for exceptional performance motivate the agent to deliver substantial effort both and after he acquires privileged information about the production environment.
