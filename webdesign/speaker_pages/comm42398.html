Title: The G/GI/N Queue in the Halfin-Whitt Regime: Idle Time System Equations<br>Author: Josh Reed, New York University, Stern School of Business, 44 West 4th Street, New York, NY, United States of America, jreed@stern.nyu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the G/GI/N queue in the Halfin-Whitt regime. Although the main results presented in this talk are not new, the methodology by which they are obtained is. In particular, we model the queue length process as the difference between arrivals and departures. This approach requires an unconventional centering of the departure process from the system. The main results presented provide both fluid and diffusion limits for the queue length process of the G/GI/N queue in the Halfin-Whitt regime.
