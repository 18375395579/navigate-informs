Title: Stochastic Root Finding in One Dimension for Increasing Convex Functions<br>Author: Shane G. Henderson, Associate Professor, Cornell University, 230 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, sgh9@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samuel M. T. Ehrlichman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study this problem first assuming exact function evaluations and second assuming interval estimates. The algorithms studied are gradient-free and do not depend upon any additional smoothness conditions.  We provide a performance guarantee in the deterministic case and a probabilistic performance guarantee in the stochastic case.
