<br>Title: A Stochastic Approximation Method for the Single-leg RM Problem with Discrete Demand Distributions</br><br>Author: Sumit Kunnumkal, Assistant Professor, Indian School of Business, AC 4, Level 1, 4116, Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, AP, 500032, India, sumit_kunnumkal@isb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Huseyin Topaloglu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally allocating seats on a single flight leg to the demands from multiple fare classes that arrive sequentially. We develop a new stochastic approximation method to compute the optimal protection levels under the assumption that the demand distributions are not known and we only have access to samples from the demand distributions. Computational experiments indicate that our method can provide significant advantages over existing methods.</br>
