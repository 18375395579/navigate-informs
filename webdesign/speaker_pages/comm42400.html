Title: Gate Assignment Problem with Swing Gates<br>Author: Yidong Zhang, Sabre Airline Solutions, 1055 West Zhongshan Road, Room 1008, Shanghai, China, yidong.zhang@sabre.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Traditional models for a gate assignment problem (GAP) assign arrival/departure flights to gates on schedule, where gates are configured to serve either domestic or international flights. For airports to fully utilize limited resources, some gates (swing gates) could serve different types of flights. Here we present a model not just assigning flights to gates, but also determining the time when a gate swings to serve other types of flights. Numerical experiments validated the design of model.
