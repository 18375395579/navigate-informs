<br>Title: Flexible Routing of a Hazmat Vehicle in a Weather System</br><br>Author: Xiao Wang, Ph.D, University at Buffalo, 423 Bell Hall, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, xw27@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Karwan, Rajan Batta</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new model to measuring risk for the single hazmat vehicle routing problem under the effects of a weather system in a more generalized and natural setting then proposed in earlier work.  In addition, the new risk measure is used within a routing algorithm which allows a dynamic parking strategy and offers greater flexibility to consider one or more objectives.</br>
