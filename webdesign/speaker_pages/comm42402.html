Cardenal Cisneros, 3, Madrid, 28040, Spain, luis.cadarso@upm.es</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Rapid transit systems are highly complex systems. They are characterized by high frequencies and short distances. Their planning and operational processes are fields rich in combinatorial optimization problems. We develop timetable planning, rolling stock assignment, train routing, and integrated recovery models in order to determine robust schedules and recovery plans for disruption management. We report our computational tests on realistic problem instances of the Spanish rail operator RENFE.</br>
