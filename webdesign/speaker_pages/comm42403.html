Title: Stochastic Depletion Problems: On the Greedy Policy for a Class Of Dynamic Optimization Problems<br>Author: Vivek Farias, Assistant Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management, 30 Wadsworth Street, E53-317, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, vivekf@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Carri Chan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider 'Stochastic Depletion Problems'. These problems are difficult both from a pragmatic computational perspective as also from a theoretical   perspective. We isolate two simple properties that, if satisfied by a problem within this class, guarantee that a myopic policy is a 2-approximation. We demonstrate applications of the result to problems ranging from stochastic broadcast scheduling to delay sensitive control of a discrete time `call-center' model.
