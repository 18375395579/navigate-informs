Areas of investigation include inventory allocation in multi-echelon supply chains with capacity constraints, ordering policies and stock-out decisions in a multiple demand class environment, and workload smoothing under seasonal dynamic demands.  We present an innovative network design which takes advantage of economies of scale to address these questions.</br>
