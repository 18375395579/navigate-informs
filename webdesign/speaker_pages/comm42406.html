<br>Title: Self-sufficient and Pareto-improving Toll with Continuously Distributed Travel Times</br><br>Author: Marco Nie, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, y-nie@northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers a static congestion pricing model in which users select a mode from either, passenger car or transit service, to minimize their own travel cost. The cumulative distribution of users?value of time (VOT) is assumed to be a continuous function. A general condition is established to ensure the existence of a self-sufficient and pareto-improving toll scheme. We prove that a self-sufficient and Pareto-improving toll always exists if the VOT distribution function is concave.</br>
