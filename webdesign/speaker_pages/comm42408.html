Title: An Algorithm and Demand Estimation Procedure for Retail Assortment Optimization<br>Author: Ramnath Vaidyanathan, PhD Student, The Wharton School, 500 Jon M Huntsman Hall, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, ramnathv@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marshall Fisher<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of choosing a subset of SKUs in a category, to be carried by a retailer, to maximize sales or a defined profit function. Assortments can vary by store, subject to a maximum number of different assortments. We describe an approach to estimate demand and substitution parameters from sales history, and propose heuristics to select the optimal assortment. We apply this approach to optimize assortments for two categories, tires and snacks, producing sales lifts of 41% and 36%.
