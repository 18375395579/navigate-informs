Title: Arc Reversals in Hybrid Bayesian Networks with Deterministic Variables<br>Author: Esma Nur Cinicioglu, PhD Candidate in Operations Management, University of Kansas School of Business, 1300 Sunnyside Avenue, Summerfield Hall, Lawrence, KS, 66045-7585, United States, esmanur@ku.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Prakash P. Shenoy<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss arc reversals in hybrid Bayesian networks with deterministic variables. Hybrid Bayesian networks contain a mix of discrete and continuous chance variables. A chance variable is said to be deterministic if its conditional distributions have zero variances. Arc reversals are important in making inferences in hybrid Bayesian networks and influence diagrams.
