Title: Harvesting with Uncertain Price Scenarios<br>Author: Martin Quinteros, Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, E53-356, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States, mquinter@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andres Weintraub, Monique Guignard, Laureano Escudero, Antonio Alonso-Ayuso<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a tactical problem where main decisions are blocks to harvest each period and access roads to build.  Future prices and demands are uncertain, reflected through scenarios for each period with estimated probabilities. We present a coordinated branching approach to this MIP which efficiently finds a solution that maximizes expected returns while guaranteeing feasibility under all scenarios. We compare with a classical deterministic approach using data from a Chilean forest industry.
