<br>Title: Investigating Random Keys Representation in a Particle Swarm Optimization Metaheuristic</br><br>Author: Vinodh Sankaran, Dr.Mary Elizaberth Kurz/Clemson university, Clemson, SC, United States of America, vsankar@clemson.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This talk considers how the combinatorial optimization problem of scheduling flexible flow line to minimize makespan can be attacked with particle swarm optimization by representing the combinatorial solution with random keys.  Extensive computational experiments are facilitated through the use of high-throughput computing via Clemson’s Condor grid.</br>
