<br>Title: En Route Speed Control Methods for Transferring Terminal Delay</br><br>Author: James Jones, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, jonesjc1@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Lovell, Michael Ball</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present an approach for transferring terminal delay to the en route phase of flight. We propose a multi-objective integer programming model designed to assign delays to flights in advance of the terminal. The model weights an objective of fuel savings and throughput to assign controlled times of arrival to flights 500 nmi from the airport. We demonstrate that the model can effectively transfer delay en route. This delay transfer yields significant fuel savings benefits on a per flight basis.</br>
