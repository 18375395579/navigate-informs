<br>Title: Relationship-Specific Investments and Mechanism Design</br><br>Author: Sameer Hasija, Insead, 1 Ayer Rajah Avenue, Singapore, 138676, Singapore, sameer.hasija@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vladimir Mares</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a client's mechanism choice to select one of two vendors with private cost information. The problem is complicated as one vendor with inherent knowledge, potentially generates a higher surplus for the client, subject to the client's relation-specific investment. The trade-off between implementing an optimal skewed mechanism with an ex ante relationship-specific investment and an optimal symmetric mechanism is investigated.</br>
