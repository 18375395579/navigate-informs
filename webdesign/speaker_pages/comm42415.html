Title: Skill and Capacity Management in Large-scale Marketplaces<br>Author: Eren Cil, University of Oregon, 1208 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, 97403-1208, United States of America, erencil@uoregon.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gad Allon, Achal Bassamboo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We characterize the optimal skill screening mechanism of a firm moderating a large-scale service marketplace where the ability of a service provider to cater customers, who can be of two classes, varies. We show that when the values that a service provider generates for each customer class are independent, the firm may need to refuse some of the service providers via its screening mechanism whereas this is never optimal when these values are perfectly correlated.
