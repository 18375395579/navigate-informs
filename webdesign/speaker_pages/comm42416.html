Title: Dynamic Software Release Management<br>Author: Angelo Mancini, PhD Student, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, 5807 S. Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, amancini@chicagobooth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dan Adelman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Software release management is the process by which firms decide on the timing and composition of future releases.  We establish conditions under which the firm can use a modified discount factor to model the impact of a stochastically improving competitor.  We then formulate the problem as a semi-Markov decision process, and identify a scenario for which the optimal policy is open loop.  Finally, we apply approximate dynamic programming to construct several high-performing policies.
