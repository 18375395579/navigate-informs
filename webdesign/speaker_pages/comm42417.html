<br>Title: A Two-stage Stochastic Optimization Model for Container Relocation Problem</br><br>Author: Setareh Borjian, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 60 Wadsworth Street, Cambridge, Ma, 02142, United States of America, sborjian@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vahideh Manshadi, Patrick Jaillet, Cynthia Barnhart</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present an integer programming formulation for the container relocation problem (CRP) under dynamic setting, i.e., continual stacking and discharging of the items. Further, we develop a two-stage stochastic optimization model for CRP under uncertainty, which minimizes the expected number of relocations and total delay in the discharging process.</br>
