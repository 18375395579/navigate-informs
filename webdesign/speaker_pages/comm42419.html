<br>Title: Transient Analysis of the TCP Window Size Process</br><br>Author: Johan Leeuwaarden, Technical University of Eindhoven, Netherlands, j.s.h.v.leeuwaarden@TUE.nl</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The window size in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) can be modeled as a Markov process that increases linearly in time and experiences downward jumps at Poisson times. We present a transient analysis of this process, including explicit results for transient moments and hitting times. This is joint work with A.H. Lopker.</br>
