<br>Title: Utility Bayesian Networks</br><br>Author: Ali Abbas, Associate Professor and Director, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61822, United States of America, aliabbas@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sewoong Oh, Zhengwei Sun</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a graphical representation of multiattribute utility functions that represents an expansion order of the multiattribute utility tree (Abbas 2011). The new graph consists of two directed acyclic graphs superimposed: the first represents the utility independence relations and the second represents the boundary independence relations. New rules for arc reversals in utility networks are introduced to facilitate the elicitation process.</br>
