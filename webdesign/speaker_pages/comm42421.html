<br>Title: Patient-focused Considerations in Home Health Nurse Routing Problems</br><br>Author: Kunlei Lian, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, klian@email.uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ashlea Bennett Milburn</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a study undertaken to quantify the costs of patient-focused considerations in home health nurse routing problems, such as nurse consistency, time consistency and time windows. We model these problems as vehicle routing problem variants. The magnitude of travel cost increase that results from introducing one or more of these considerations is studied. Computational results are presented for a variety of test instances.</br>
