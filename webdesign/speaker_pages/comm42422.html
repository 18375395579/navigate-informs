Title: A Unified Approach to State Freight Flow Model Development<br>Author: Peerapol Sittivijan, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, United States, peerapol.sittivijan@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sandeep Srivathsan, Charu Ojha, Jiahui Wang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present an approach that considers regional and with-in state freight flows in a unified manner. We develop a code-mapping scheme to relate commodity categories to industrial sectors.  Using the code-mapping scheme and the population and employment data in each county, we split the attraction and production freight flows from state to county level. The flow assignment of combined regional-state freight movement will be used to identify paths with high freight flow at the county level.
