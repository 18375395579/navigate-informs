Predictive analytics is used to forecast the show outcome of appointment requests, which, based on this prediction, are optimally scheduled. Descriptive analytics is used to interpret the output of this optimization problem in order to derive a heuristic policy. The prediction quality determines whether a clinic should adopt a single-day scheduling horizon or not, and whether it should overbook or not.</br>
