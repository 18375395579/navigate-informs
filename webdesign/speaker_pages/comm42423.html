Title: Data-driven Appointment Scheduling in the Presence of No-shows<br>Author: Michele Samorani, Alberta School of Business, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, samorani@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Linda LaGanga<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We solve the problem of scheduling outpatient appointments in the presence of no-shows. Predictive analytics is used to forecast the show outcome of appointment requests, which, based on this prediction, are optimally scheduled. Descriptive analytics is used to interpret the output of this optimization problem in order to derive a heuristic policy. The prediction quality determines whether a clinic should adopt a single-day scheduling horizon or not, and whether it should overbook or not.
