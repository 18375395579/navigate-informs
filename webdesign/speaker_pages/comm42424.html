Title: The Anatomy of Newsvendor Order Decisions: Results from a Task Decomposition Experiment<br>Author: Yun Shin Lee, Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, ysl27@cam.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Enno Siemsen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the anatomy of a newsvendor order decision by decomposing it into point forecast, distribution forecast and service level decision and take a systematic approach to predict actual order behavior using these components. We also test whether we can improve order decisions by forcing decision makers to recognize the decomposed components.
