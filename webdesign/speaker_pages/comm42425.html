Title: A Combinatorial Allocation Mechanism with Penalties for Banner Advertising<br>Author: Vahab Mirrokni, Google Research, New York, NY, United States of America, mirrokni@theory.csail.mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Uri Feige, Nicole Immorlica, Hamid Nazerzadeh<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a new system for selling display advertising satisfying a guaranteed delivery property.  In this system, we guarantee that advertisers receive at least as many advertising opportunities as they requested or else receive ample compensation in the form of monetary payment. We show that the revenue maximization problem is inapproximable and thus present three greedy heuristics for this problem, a bicriteria approximation and two algorithms with guaranteed structural approximation.
