Title: Benefits and Challenges of using a Swing Weight Matrix for Data Center Location Selection<br>Author: Elizabeth Viggiano, US Dept of Defense, 6743 Old Waterloo Rd, 202, Elkridge, MD, 21075, United States of America, elizabethviggiano@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Adam Clark<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Selecting a data center location is a complex process with motivation for and against use of a swing weight matrix to elicit value measure weights.  The many competing objectives are more manageable in a matrix format than pair-wise comparisons.  However, countless location alternatives necessitate the use of strong screening criteria, which are less explicit in the matrix.  This effort supported multiple data center location selections for an element of the US Department of Defense.
