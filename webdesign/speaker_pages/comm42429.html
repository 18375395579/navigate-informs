<br>Title: Integrated Logistics Network Design and Inventory Stocking with Customer-Dedicated Facilities</br><br>Author: Ilyas Iyoob, PhD Candidate, University of Texas at Austin, ETC 5.124, C2200, Austin, TX, 78705, United States, iiyoob@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erhan Kutanoglu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Most of the work on logistics network design considers locating only one type of facilities.  However, companies may prefer to have a variety of facilities. This paper expands earlier integrated network design and inventory models by explicitly considering two types of stocking facilities, one type serving multiple customers, and the other dedicated to a single customer. Computational results show that considering dedicated facilities may improve service, solution quality and time.</br>
