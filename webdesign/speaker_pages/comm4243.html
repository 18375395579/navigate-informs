Title: Wind Power Investment: A Risk-constrained Multi-stage MPEC Approach<br>Author: Luis Baringo, Univ. Castilla - La Mancha, E.T.S.I. Industriales, Ciudad Real, 13071, Spain, Luis.Baringo@uclm.es<br>Coauthor(s): Antonio Conejo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The investment in wind facilities is highly conditioned by the uncertainty in demand and wind production, the eventual decline of investment cost, and the risk of profit volatility associated to the investment decisions. Considering these important issues, this presentation provides a stochastic risk-constrained multi-stage MPEC to decide the optimal investment on wind facilities of an investor that aims at maximizing its expected profit while minimizing its risk of profit volatility.
