Norman, Jayant Rajgopal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We examine the question of when to open multi-dose vials of vaccines given that partially used vials have a limited shelf life. Under the objective of maximizing the expected number of vaccinations administered between consecutive stock replenishments, we formulate and a Markov decision process model that determines when to cease vaccine administration as a function of time of day, vial inventory and the number of days until replenishment.   Structural and numerical results are presented.
