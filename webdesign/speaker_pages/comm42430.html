<br>Title: Dynamically Optimizing the Administration of Vaccines from Multi-dose Vials</br><br>Author: Maryam Hasanzadeh Mofrad, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, mah249@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Maillart, Bryan A. Norman, Jayant Rajgopal</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We examine the question of when to open multi-dose vials of vaccines given that partially used vials have a limited shelf life. Under the objective of maximizing the expected number of vaccinations administered between consecutive stock replenishments, we formulate and a Markov decision process model that determines when to cease vaccine administration as a function of time of day, vial inventory and the number of days until replenishment.   Structural and numerical results are presented.</br>
