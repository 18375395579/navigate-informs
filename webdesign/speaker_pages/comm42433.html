Title: Incentives for Prevention and Remediation of Random Compliance Violations<br>Author: Sang Kim, Associate Professor, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States of America, sang.kim@yale.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a setting in which a regulator performs inspections on a production facility owned by a firm to ensure environmental compliance. The firm may disclose random occurrences of compliance violations and/or exert costly effort to prevent and mitigate the impact of the violations. The regulator sets the inspection rate and the penalty in order to minimize the long-run social cost. We characterize the equilibrium of this game and study the impact on the environment and the social cost.
