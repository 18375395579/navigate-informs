The firm may disclose random occurrences of compliance violations and/or exert costly effort to prevent and mitigate the impact of the violations. The regulator sets the inspection rate and the penalty in order to minimize the long-run social cost. We characterize the equilibrium of this game and study the impact on the environment and the social cost.</br>
