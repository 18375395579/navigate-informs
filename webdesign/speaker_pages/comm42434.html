<br>Title: A Spatial Queuing Perspective of the Fundamental Traffic Diagram</br><br>Author: Ketan Savla, Assistant Professor, University of Southern California, KAP 254A, 3620 South Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-2531, United States of America, ksavla@usc.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a spatial queuing system on a semi-infinite line. Jobs arrive at the origin according to a Poisson process, and leave the system after traveling a distance in the positive direction that is sampled independently from an exponential distribution. The time-varying speeds of the jobs model the dynamic speed adjustment behavior of drivers in transportation systems. We study fluid and diffusion limits of this queuing system, and explore connections with the fundamental traffic diagram.</br>
