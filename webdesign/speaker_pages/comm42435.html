Title: Stochastic Optimization of Sensor Network<br>Author: Michael Zabarankin, Assistant Professor, Stevens Instiute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, Michael.Zabarankin@stevens.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anton Molyboha<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A two-stage stochastic optimization problem for optimal configuration of a sensor network for protecting an anchored vessel from underwater threats has been considered. The second stage adapts signal processing to environmental conditions (ambient noise, etc.) and, as a result, combines signals from network sensors optimally. Various network configurations with the same number of sensors have been considered, and among those, an optimal network configuration has been identified.
