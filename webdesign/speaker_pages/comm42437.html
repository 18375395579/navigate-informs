Title: A Transient Queueing Model and its Analysis<br>Author: Harsh Honappa, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, honnappa@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rahul Jain, Amy Ward<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce a transient queueing model in which service occurs over a finite period, and a finite population of customers arrive.  Such models are relevant in diverse application contexts, such as when modeling queueing for a popular concert, a lunch cafeteria, etc..  However, their exact analysis is hard.  We develop fluid and diffusion approximations under the assumption that customers sample their arrival time from some given distribution F with compact support, and service times are i.i.d.
