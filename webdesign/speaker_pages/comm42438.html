Raghavan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In many application domains, a mobile service facility provides service to events while stationary. For example, portable base stations are used in cellular networks to provide coverage in emergency situations and for special events. In this talk, we discuss routing mobile facilities to maximize demand coverage in a continuous time framework.  This problem displays some similarities to the Dynamic Facility Location Problem, although we consider a continuous time planning horizon.</br>
