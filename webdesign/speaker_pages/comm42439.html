Title: Wavelength Routing, Assignment and Translation in an All-optical Network<br>Author: Dave Allen, Distinguished MTS, Verizon, 2400 North Glenville, Richardon, TX, 75082, United States, dave.allen1@verizon.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: An all-optical network requires selection of routes and wavelengths between nodes. Even in an optimized design, wavelength contention on fibers can occur, requiring expensive design modifications. We present a novel method to optimize routing, wavelength assignment and translation at user-specified nodes so that overall cost is minimized. The model is applicable to both new designs and incremental changes. Results for 1+1 protection show significant savings compared to “expedient?selections.
