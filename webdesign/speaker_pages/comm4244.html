Title: Scheduling Under Stochastic Order<br>Author: Xiaoqiang Cai, Professor, Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong - ROC, xqcai@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Liming Wang, Xian Zhou<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine, to minimize the maximum lateness ML under  stochastic order. The processing time, the due date, and the weight of each job may all be random variables. We obtain the optimal sequences in a number of situations.
