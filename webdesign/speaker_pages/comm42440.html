We show that the first-best congestion pricing schemes do not necessarily lead to less emissions, and then prove there always exists a nonnegative charging scheme that induces a flow distribution with minimum emissions. We provide a bound on the percent reduction in emissions achievable by any charging scheme, and then offer methods for computing charges that alleviate congestion and emissions.</br>
