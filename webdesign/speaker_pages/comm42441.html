<br>Title: Multi-objective Semiconductor Manufacturing Scheduling</br><br>Author: Mary Beth Kurz, Clemson University, 110 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States, mkurz@CLEMSON.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Letitia Pohl, Scott Mason, John Fowler, Michelle Pfund</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine a complex multiobjective semiconductor manufacturing scheduling problem with 2 batch processing steps linked by a timer constraint, which requires that any job completing the first processing step must be started on the second machine within a time limit; otherwise, the job must repeat the first step. We develop deterministic and probabilistic algorithms which are evaluated through the use of the Integrated Convex Preference measure over a wide range of experimental problem instances.</br>
