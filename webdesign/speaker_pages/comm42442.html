Title: Vehicle Supply Chains for Disaster Response in International Humanitarian Organizations<br>Author: Alfonso Pedraza-Martinez, Assistant Professor, Indiana University, 1309 E 10th Street, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, alpedraz@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Luk Van Wassenhove, Jon Stauffer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: By modeling the vehicle supply chain of an International Humanitarian Organization, this research proposes the concept of a temporary hub in major disaster areas. Temporary hubs can: a) mitigate the operational constraints due to earmarked funding during disaster response and, b) reduce total logistics costs in years without major disasters.
