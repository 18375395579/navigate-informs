<br>Title: A Duality Based Relaxation and Decomposition Approach for Inventory Distribution Systems</br><br>Author: Sumit Kunnumkal, Assistant Professor, Indian School of Business, AC 4, Level 1, 4116, Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, AP, 500032, India, sumit_kunnumkal@isb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Huseyin Topaloglu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a new method to make the inventory replenishment decisions in a distribution system consisting of multiple retailers and a single warehouse. Our method is based on relaxing the constraints that ensure the nonnegativity of the shipments to the retailers by associating Lagrange multipliers with them. Numerical studies show that our method can provide significant improvements over traditional methods when the balance assumption of Clark and Scarf (1960) is not satisfactory.</br>
