Title: A Vessel Routing Problem with Time Windows for Steel-raw Materials Delivery<br>Author: Byung-In Kim, POSTECH, San 31, Hyoja, Namgu, Pohang, 790-784, Korea, Republic of, bkim@postech.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Juyoung Wy, Jongsung Lee<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This research considers a vessel routing problem with time windows, in which loads can be split or can be combined and be loaded into ships, and the ships can visit multiple ports to load or unload materials in each trip. We want to find routes of a fleet of ships which provide smooth supply of raw materials with less cost. A mathematical model and a large neighborhood search algorithm are developed for the problem. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
