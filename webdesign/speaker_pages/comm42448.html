Title: Data-driven Newsvendor with Temporally Dependent Demand<br>Author: Alp Akcay, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, aakcay@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bahar Biller, Sridhar Tayur<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Considering a newsvendor problem with temporally dependent demand data, we characterize a probabilistic guarantee for the expected cost of an inventory-target estimate to be close to the optimal expected cost with an arbitrarily small relative error. Our analysis sheds light on the role of temporal dependence in inventory-target estimation.
