Title: Integrated Decision Making on Reconfiguration and Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)<br>Author: Jing Zhou, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Michigan, 2350 Hayward Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States, zhoujz@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Julie Simmons Ivy, Dragan Djurdjanovic, Jun Ni<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In a multi-unit load sharing system, the dynamic interactions between component deterioration, working load, and production yield necessitate an integrated decision making on reconfiguration and CBM. An integrated model for the joint optimization of the economic load allocation and the optimal maintenance level is developed and illustrated through a numerical example. The results demonstrate that the integrated decision policy outperforms the fragmented one in terms of reduced total cost.
