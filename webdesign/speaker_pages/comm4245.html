Title: Transmission Expansion and Nash Equilibria<br>Author: Andy Philpott, Professor, The University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, AK, 1025, New Zealand, a.philpott@auckland.ac.nz<br>Coauthor(s): Golbon Zakeri, Tony Downward<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a system operator expanding the capacity of an electricity transmission system so as to yield a network with enough capacity so that generators in a nodal electricity pool market have no incentive to game transmission constraints. For networks without loops or losses, these capacities can be represented by a convex polyhedral set, which can be incorporated into a multi-stage stochastic programming model.  The difficulties of extending this to more general settings will be discussed.
