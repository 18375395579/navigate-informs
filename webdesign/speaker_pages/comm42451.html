Title: Inventory Allocation in a Non-Profit Distribution System<br>Author: Robert Lien, Northwestern University, robertlien@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karen Smilowitz, Seyed Iravani<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Customer demands are observed as they are visited along a delivery route.  The inventory allocation decision is made to optimize a fill-rate objective which serves to give equitable distribution to all customers on the route.  We characterize the optimal solution as well as develop and analyze heuristics.  In addition we study the effect of different sequencing of customers.
