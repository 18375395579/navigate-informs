Title: Airlines Strategic Competition: A Network Equilibrium Approach<br>Author: Ahmed Hassan, Research Assistant, Southern Methodist University, P.O. Box 750340, Dallas, tx, 75275-0340, United States, aehassan@engr.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Khaled Abdelghany, Ahmed Abdelghany<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a network equilibrium approach for modeling airlines competition at the strategic level. The model replicates air carrier decisions regarding network configuration and service frequency considering resources availability and system capacity limitations. Problem formulation, solution algorithm and Texas preliminary results are presented.
