Title: Appointment Policies with Patient Preferences<br>Author: Yu Zhang, University of South Florida, 4202 E Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL, United States of America, yuzhang@usf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vidyadhar Kulkarni<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider an appointment system where the patients have preferences about the appointment days. A patient may be scheduled on one of the days that is acceptable to her, or be denied appointment. The patient may or may not show up on the appointed time. The cost is a convex function of the actual number of patients served on a given day. We present structural properties of the appointment policy, and study a heuristic policy that is easy to implement and performs well.
