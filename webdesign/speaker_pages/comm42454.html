Title: The TSP Race Problem<br>Author: Bahar Cavdar, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, baharca@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joel Sokol<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A traveling salesman is given a set of cities to visit.  How long does it take to complete his tour, from the time he gets the data to the time he returns home?  That depends not only on travel time, but also on how long it takes him to compute his route.  We study the TSP Race problem, where it is sometimes optimal to sacrifice tour minimization in order to decrease decision time.
