Title: Optimal Routing of Locomotives to Shops for Quarterly Maintenances<br>Author: Ravindra Ahuja, President, Innovative Scheduling, Inc., GTEC, 2153 SE Hawthorne Road,, Suite, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, ahuja@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zeynep Sargut, Artyom Nahapetyan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The locomotive fleet for a large freight railroad contains thousands of locomotives which must be sent to shops for quarterly maintenances. Sending locomotives to shops just-in-time, neither early nor late, and in a manner so that each shop receives the same number of locomotives every day which is equal to its shop capacity, is a very complex optimization problem. We will describe an MIP-based methodology to solve this problem and present computational results from a real-life application.
