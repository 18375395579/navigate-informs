<br>Title: A Method to Detect Out of Stock Incidences from POS Data</br><br>Author: Daniel Corsten, Professor of Operations & Technology Management,, IE Business School, María de Molina, 11, 28006 Madrid, daniel.corsten@ie.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andreas Ruckstuhl, Christoph Heitz</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Despite increased interest no reliable measurement has yet been developed to estimate lost sales from POS data. In this paper we describe the demand process as a Poisson process, removing non-stationarity by a novel time transformation method. Statistical analysis of the transformed inter-arrival times allows detection of out-of-stock periods. We apply this method to a new POS dataset which is complemented with manually measured data on OOS incidents and compare the results.</br>
