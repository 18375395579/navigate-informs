It also show different values when controllers trade off arrival and departure capacities to accommodate imbalanced demand in air traffic flow management. This study applies a combined Tobit regression model and Vector Autoregression Model to analyze the airport capacity and understand the incremental effects from NextGen programs deployed in recent years.</br>
