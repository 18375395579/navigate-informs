Title: Airport Capacity Assessment using Advanced Econometrics Models<br>Author: Yu Zhang, University of South Florida, Civil and Environmental Engineering Dept, 4202 East Fowler Ave., Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, yuzhang@usf.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Airport capacity varies with many factors, to name a few, the configuration of runways, the fleet mix of the flights, weather condition. It also show different values when controllers trade off arrival and departure capacities to accommodate imbalanced demand in air traffic flow management. This study applies a combined Tobit regression model and Vector Autoregression Model to analyze the airport capacity and understand the incremental effects from NextGen programs deployed in recent years.
