Title: The Network Design of Spatially Distributed Service Systems with Two Prioritized Call Classes<br>Author: Seokjin Kim, Assistant Professor, Suffolk University, Sawyer Business School, 8 Ashburton Place, Boston, MA, 02108, United States of America, kim@suffolk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Opher Baron, Oded Berman, Dmitry Krass<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop location models for an emergency system with mobile servers and two call classes, one for high priority calls and the other for regular calls. The problem is to minimize the number of servers on a network while achieving at least required service levels for the two calls classes. Markovian demands originate at nodes. Servers can be stationed at nodes and provide service to calls within a pre-specified coverage radius.
