<br>Title: Global Sensor Management: Real-time Reallocation of Military Assets among Competing Tasks</br><br>Author: John Dulin, North Carolina State University, 844 Seastone St, Raleigh, NC, 27603, United States of America, jldulin@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thom Hodgson, Kristin Arney, Ben Lobo</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The United States military maintains a network of sensor assets for detecting threats, collecting intelligence and monitoring space. We are developing a tool for real-time reallocation of these sensors in response to events around the globe.  We consider an integer programming formulation and heuristic approaches to find good solutions that maximize the probabilities of accomplishing certain tasks, while meeting threshold, capacity, and other network-imposed sensor functionality constraints.</br>
