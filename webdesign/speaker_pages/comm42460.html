Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, ZChen@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In many applications of time-sensitive products, finished orders are delivered to customers shortly after the production. Consequently, there is little finished product inventory in the supply chain such that production and outbound distribution are closely linked and must be scheduled jointly.  Research on integrated scheduling of production and outbound distribution is relatively recent, but growing rapidly. We will provide an overview of the latest developments in this area.</br>
