<br>Title: Optimal Production Gang Scheduling for Railway Maintenance Operations</br><br>Author: Gang Li, PhD Student, The University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business, 1 University Station B6000, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, gang.li@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brian Roth, Anant Balakrishnan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Given a set of railway maintenance jobs with time windows and inter-job coordination requirements, production gang scheduling seeks to select and assign production gangs to jobs, sequence the jobs, and route the gangs between jobs to minimize the total cost for employing, assigning, and re-positioning gangs. We formulate the problem as a large-scale integer program, develop valid inequalities to strengthen the model, and report computational results using real data.</br>
