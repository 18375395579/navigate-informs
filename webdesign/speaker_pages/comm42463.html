Wakker, Kirsten Rohde<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The commonly used hyperbolic discount functions imply decreasing impatience. At the individual level there will always be some individuals who exhibit increasing impatience. Hence, to fit data at the individual level, new discount functions are needed. This paper introduces such functions, which can accommodate any degree of decreasing or increasing impatience.
