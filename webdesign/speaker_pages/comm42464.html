Customer demand is affected by prices and service levels. A closed-form solution is given for one-facility case. Multi-facility problem is formulated as system optimization model and as user optimization models. System optimization assumes customers cooperate with a central authority to achieve the best performance of the system; in user optimization model  customers act individually in making their decisions.
