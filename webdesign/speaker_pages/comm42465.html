Title: A Graph Theoretic Version of the Cell Transmission Model: The Single Destination Case<br>Author: Georgios Kalafatas, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN, United States, gkalafat@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The cell transmission model (CTM) has been used in the past to develop a linear formulation for the single destination dynamic traffic assignment problem, and show the existence of a minimum cost flow sub-structure. Here, the fundamental equations of the CTM are revisited to develop a complete graph structure. The trade-offs between modeling accuracy and computational benefits are highlighted and key properties like uniqueness are addressed in graph theoretic terms.
