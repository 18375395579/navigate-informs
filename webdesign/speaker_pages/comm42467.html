Title: Constrained Defense Allocations for Multiple Targets<br>Author: Susan Martonosi, Harvey Mudd College, 301 Platt Blvd., Claremont, CA, 91711, United States of America, martonosi@hmc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eugene Quan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The decision of how to allocate limited security resources to defend several potential targets for attack is an important problem in homeland security.  We consider a two-target game involving an attacker and defender, who must choose at what levels to attack/defend each target, subject to budget constraints. We show how the attacker’s/defender’s respective decisions to attack/defend neither, one or both targets depend on the size of their respective budgets and other game parameters.
