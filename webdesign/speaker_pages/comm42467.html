We consider a two-target game involving an attacker and defender, who must choose at what levels to attack/defend each target, subject to budget constraints. We show how the attacker’s/defender’s respective decisions to attack/defend neither, one or both targets depend on the size of their respective budgets and other game parameters.</br>
