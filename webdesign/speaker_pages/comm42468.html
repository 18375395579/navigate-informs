Title: Green Up and Adjacency Issues in Forest Spatial Harvesting<br>Author: Andres Weintraub, Professor, University of Chile, Department of Industrial Engineering, Santiago, Chile, aweintra@dii.uchile.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Marcos Goycoolea, Juan Pablo Vielma, Alan Murray<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The ARM consists in imposing maximum clearcut size constraints in forest harvest scheduling problems. We discuss green-up extensions of the ARM, distinguishing between static and dynamic green-up constraints. Computational results for different formulations show these are very difficult. In addition, we discuss the impact of different adjacency definitions.
