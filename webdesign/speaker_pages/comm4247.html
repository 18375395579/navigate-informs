Title: Convergence to Equilibrium in Local Interaction Games and Ising Models<br>Author: Amin Saberi, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Building, Room 317, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, saberi@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrea Montanari<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a two-strategies coordination game played asynchronously between the nodes of a network. Agents behave according to a noisy best-response dynamics.    It is known that noise removes the degeneracy among equilibria: In the long run, the ``risk-dominant'' behavior spreads throughout the network. Here we consider the problem of computing the typical time scale for the spread of this behavior.
