Agents behave according to a noisy best-response dynamics.    It is known that noise removes the degeneracy among equilibria: In the long run, the ``risk-dominant'' behavior spreads throughout the network. Here we consider the problem of computing the typical time scale for the spread of this behavior.</br>
