Title: Cost Minimization of Assemble-to-order Systems via Stochastic Programming<br>Author: Kai Huang, Assistant Professor in Supply Chain Management, Binghamton University, State University of New York, School of Management, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, 13902, United States of America, K.Huang@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Ton de Kok<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a two-stage stochastic integer programming model for joint optimization of base stock levels and component allocation in Assemble-To-Order systems. This model is based on the concept of “matching?between supply and assembly of components, and counts the inventory holding cost and order backlogging cost accurately. The algorithm design is discussed.
