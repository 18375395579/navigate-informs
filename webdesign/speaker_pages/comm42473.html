<br>Title: International Reserve Management: A Drift Switching Reflected Jump-diffusion Model</br><br>Author: Ning Cai, Assistant Professor, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, ningcai@ust.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuewei Yang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a drift switching reflected double exponential jump-diffusion model for international reserve management to capture both the jump behavior in reserve dynamics and the leptokurtic feature of the reserve increment distribution. The model is simple and produces a closed-form expression for the total expected discounted cost of managing reserves.</br>
