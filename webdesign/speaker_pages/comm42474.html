<br>Title: Optimal Adaptive Policies for Sequential Allocation Problems ?Revisited</br><br>Author: Apostolos Burnetas, Professor, University of Athens, Department of Mathematics, Panepistemiopolis, Athens, 15784, Greece, aburnetas@math.uoa.gr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Katehakis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Consider the problem of sequential sampling from a finite number of statistical populations under incomplete information. In a paper in 1996 we showed how to construct index-based policies with uniformly maximum convergence rate for the case in which the distributions of outcomes from each population depend on a vector of unknown parameters. That work is generalized in several directions regarding dependence of observations.  Applications in pricing and data mining are presented.</br>
