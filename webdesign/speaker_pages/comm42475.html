Title: Reliable Facility Location under the Risk of Disruptions<br>Author: Tingting Cui, UC Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, tingting@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider an uncapacitated fixed-charge location problem where the  facilities are subject to the risks of disruptions. The failure  probability of each facility site is known as a prior and assumed to  be independent. Our goal is to choose the number and locations of facilities in order to minimize the expected total fixed location cost, transportation cost and penalty cost.
