Few studies have addressed the problem of determining the number/location of initial collection points and the location/allocation of centralized return centers. Thus, we present a mixed-integer linear programming model for the design of a reverse logistics network for product returns. The objective function considers facilities costs, inventory carrying and handling costs and shipping costs with quantity discounts and distance penalties
