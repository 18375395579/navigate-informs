Sherali</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We address optimization models for multiple-runway aircraft sequencing problems under operation disruptions, namely, aircraft delays, new aircraft arrivals and flight cancellations. Extensive computational results are reported for exact as well as heuristic methods.</br>
