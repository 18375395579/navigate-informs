Title: Aircraft Rescheduling under Operation Disruptions<br>Author: Mohamed Kharbeche, Postdoctoral Associate, Qatar University, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Doha, 2713, Qatar, mkharbec@qu.edu.qa<br>Coauthor(s): Ameer Al-Salem, Ahmed Ghoniem, Hanif D. Sherali<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We address optimization models for multiple-runway aircraft sequencing problems under operation disruptions, namely, aircraft delays, new aircraft arrivals and flight cancellations. Extensive computational results are reported for exact as well as heuristic methods.
