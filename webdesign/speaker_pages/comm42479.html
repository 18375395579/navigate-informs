<br>Title: Optimal Call Center Staffing with Arrival Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Achal Bassamboo, Managerial Economics & Decision Sciences, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, a-bassamboo@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ramandeep Randhawa, Assaf Zeevi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the capacity sizing problem in a call center faced with an uncertain arrival rate. In a large system setting, we first characterize the solution to the first order fluid problem. Then, we characterize the second-order refinement to it. We show that the order of this refinement depends on the distribution of the arrival rate. This refinement is typically of a much small order than that proposed by the square root staffing.</br>
