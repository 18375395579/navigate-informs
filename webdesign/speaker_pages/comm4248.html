Title: RNA Secondary Structures and Trees<br>Author: Neng Fan, University of Florida, 401 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, andynfan@ufl.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The sequence of bases of the RNA molecule is known as primary structure, and a subset of helical structure consistent with a planar graph is known as secondary structure. We establish several one-to-one correspondences between the structures and trees. The mathematical propositions of RNA arrays, such as structures and enumerations, always having biological backgrounds, will be easy to obtain from the correspondences.
