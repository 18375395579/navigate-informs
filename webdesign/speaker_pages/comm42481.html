Title: Flexible, Analytical Modeling of Airport Security Checkpoints<br>Author: Nicholas Lownes, University of Connecticut, 261 Glenbrook Rd, U-3037, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, nlownes@engr.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Swapna Gokhale, Derek Doran<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Aviation security checkpoints ensure the safety of air travel, yet they are a major source of stress for passengers caused by high-variance completion time distributions. We present a model that considers how passenger profiles, checkpoint components, and security policies affect completion time distributions. Illustrations highlight ways to reduce distribution variance.
