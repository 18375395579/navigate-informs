By integrating simulation with optimization, we have developed a decision support system for hump yard management that can be used for planning, strategy as well as real-time scheduling. For example, it can be used to determine the blocking and car handling capacities of a yard and the impact of yard resources (crew and locomotives) on yard performance.</br>
