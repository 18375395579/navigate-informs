<br>Title: A Stochastic Overbooking Model for Outpatient Clinical Scheduling with No-Shows</br><br>Author: Kumar Muthuraman, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 315 North Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States, kumar@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Lawley</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We formulate a stochastic overbooking model and develop an appointment scheduling policy for outpatient clinics. Each calling patient has a no-show probability, and overbooking is used to compensate for patient no-shows. The scheduling objective captures patient waiting time, staff overtime, and patient revenue. We derive conditions under which the objective evolution is unimodal and we investigate the behavior of the scheduling policy under a variety of conditions.</br>
