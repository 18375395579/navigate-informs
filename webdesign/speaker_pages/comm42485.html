Title: Reflected Brownian Motion in a Quadrant: Tail Behavior of the Stationary Distribution<br>Author: J. Michael Harrison, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94301, United States, harrison_michael@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Hasenbein<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Let Z be a two-dimensional Brownian motion confined to the non-negative quadrant by oblique reflection at the boundary.  Analytic methods are used to derive a simple formula for the asymptotic decay rate of the stationary distribution of Z along each axis, and an interpretation in terms of minimum-energy paths is provided.
