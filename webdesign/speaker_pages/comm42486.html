The least core value of a cooperative game is the minimum penalty for defection that encourages all agents to cooperate. We show that computing the least core value of schedule planning games is NP-hard, and provide a fully polynomial time approximation scheme.  In addition, we extend the analysis to cooperative games with supermodular costs.</br>
