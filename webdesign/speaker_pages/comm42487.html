<br>Title: Prioritizing Relief Aid Supplies: Post-disaster Emergency Shelter</br><br>Author: Marco Gutierrez, Georgia Institute of Technology, 1009 Mcmillan St, Atlanta, United States of America, marco.gutierrez@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John H. Vande Vate</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the process of delivering post-disaster emergency shelter to people rendered homeless by disasters. During a response, relief aid providers may deliver different types of shelters (e.g. plastic sheets, tents, etc.) with different characteristics (i.e. quality, cost and size). We characterize the optimal shelter delivery policy to minimize suffering when there are two shelter options, delivery channels?capacity is constrained, and the total budget for the response is limited.</br>
