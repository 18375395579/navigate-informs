Title: Scheduling Two Chains on m Machines<br>Author: Alessandro Agnetis, Professor, Universit?di Siena, Dipartimento Ingegneria Informazione, via Roma 56, Siena, 53034, Italy, agnetis@dii.unisi.it<br>Coauthor(s): Hans Kellerer, Gaia Nicosia, Andrea Pacifici<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A set of n tasks and m processing machines are given. Each task must be performed by one given machine, which can process only one task at a time. Precedence constraints exist among the tasks. We want to minimize a regular objective function of all task completion times. We address the case in which precedences take the form of two chains. We give complexity results for various special cases, including the weighted sum of task completion times and tardiness-related objectives.
