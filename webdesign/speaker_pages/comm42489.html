Title: Robust Aircraft Routing<br>Author: Mazhar Arikan, Assistant Professor, University of Kansas, School of Business, Lawrence, KS, United States of America, mazhar@ku.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vinayak Deshpande, Milind Sohoni<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we develop an approach to reroute aircraft that minimizes the total stochastic propagated delay. We complement this analysis with a study that reallocates block times across the network of an airline by considering the new routings of aircraft and analyze the trade-off between total network arrival delay minutes and network-wide block-time budget.
