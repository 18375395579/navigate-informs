Two agents compete to process their respective jobs on common machine and each agent has his own criterion to optimize. The goal is to determine a schedule for two agents?jobs such that the objective of one agent is minimized while keeping the objective of the other agent no exceeding a maximum value. We obtain different problems complexities of various scheduling environments.</br>
