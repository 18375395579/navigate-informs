John Milne</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Demand attributes such as quantity and priority can vary as a function of delivery date. We describe an element of our Supply Chain software which assigns supply to demand in the situation where demand attributes vary and multiple components are present. The software is used to plan IBM's semiconductor operations and those of an external client.</br>
