<br>Title: A Routing Policy for a Two-class Call-center Model Designed to Respond to Unexpected Overloads</br><br>Author: Ohad Perry, Columbia University, S.W. Mudd Building, 500 West 120th St., New York, NY, 10027, United States, op2105@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ward Whitt</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic call center model with two customer  classes and two server pools. We propose a parametric routing policy aimed to respond to unexpected overloads. A deterministic fluid model is developed, intended to be appropriate in the overloaded or efficiency-driven heavy traffic limiting regime. Analysis involves a heavy-traffic averaging principle.</br>
