<br>Title: Expert Users and the Case for Endogenous Abandonment Distributions</br><br>Author: Otis Jennings, Associate Professor, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, otisj@duke.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Most queueing models that incorporate customer abandonment assume that abandonment propensity, while context- or industry-specific, does not adjust to subtle changes in system design. We argue and provide empirical evidence that expert users ?i.e. those who access the system often ?will eventually notice changes in quality of service and, hence, will adjust their tolerance for delay, expressed through patterns of abandonment. We consider implications for contact center design and incentives.</br>
