<br>Title: Optimal Expansion of a Hybrid Circuit/Packet Switched Voice Telecommunications Backbone</br><br>Author: Raghavendran Sivaraman, Doctoral Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Operations Research Center, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, rags@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Crom, Hui Liu, Rina Schneur, Donald Smith, Roger Tobin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Verizon transports voice telephone calls on a mixed circuit-switched and packet-switched network. We describe a routing optimization tool that minimizes the capital expended annually on network growth. In the first year, expansion according to the optimizer will cost about $5M, as compared to $9M using a predecessor tool that does not optimize. Over a five-year period, capital expenditures associated with the optimizer’s expansion plan should cost 30% less than those of the predecessor tool.</br>
