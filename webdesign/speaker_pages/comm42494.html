Title: Spanning Trees with variable degree bounds<br>Author: Luis Gouveia, Univ Lisbon, Campo Grande, Lisbon, Portugal, legouveia@fc.ul.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Pedro Moura, Amaro Sousa<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We describe a minimum spanning tree problem with  variable degree bounds and where the cost of each edge depends on the degree of its end nodes and where edges with a higher cost enable higher degrees. This problem is motivated by the design of wireless networks. We propose three classes of models using different sets of variables and compare from a theoretical perspective as well as from a computational point of view, the models and the corresponding linear programming relaxations.
