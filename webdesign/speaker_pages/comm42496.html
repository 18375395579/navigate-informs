An example is bike sharing. In a closed service system customers rent assets from a service station, and return them to another station after a random usage time. A management challenge is to ensure the proper balance of assets across the network of service stations. The current practice is to move assets by a fleet to rebalance the network. Our goal is to address the network imbalance with a control policy which induces balance.</br>
