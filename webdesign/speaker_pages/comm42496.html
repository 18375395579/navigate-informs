Title: Sharing Equally: Managing Collaborative Consumption<br>Author: Robert Hampshire, Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, hamp@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ana Busic<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The sharing economy is an emerging mode of resource allocation. An example is bike sharing. In a closed service system customers rent assets from a service station, and return them to another station after a random usage time. A management challenge is to ensure the proper balance of assets across the network of service stations. The current practice is to move assets by a fleet to rebalance the network. Our goal is to address the network imbalance with a control policy which induces balance.
