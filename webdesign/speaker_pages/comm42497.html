<br>Title: A Relative Total Cost Index for the Evaluation of Transportation Network Robustness</br><br>Author: Qiang Qiang, Doctoral Student, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, 01003, United States of America, qqiang@som.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anna Nagurney</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We show how to capture the robustness of a transportation network in the case of degradable links. With the use of BPR user link travel cost functions, we propose two relative total cost indices to assess transportation network robustness in the case of U-O or S-O travel behavior. We derive certain upper bounds and illustrate the indices on several transportation networks.</br>
