<br>Title: A Branch-and-price Approach to Design a Surveillance System for Homeland Security</br><br>Author: Wilbert Wilhelm, Professor, Texas A&M University, TAMUS 3131, College Station, TX, 77843-3131, United States of America, wilhelm@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elif Ilke Gokce</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A branch-and-price approach is presented to design a surveillance system for port and waterway security.  The integer programming model represents relevant practical considerations and prescribes the types of sensors, the number of each type, and the location of each sensor to meet surveillance requirements while minimizing total cost.  Computational tests are reported.</br>
