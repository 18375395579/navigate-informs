In this paper, a reliability-centered maintenance model, based on Markovian transition probabilities and dynamic programming, is introduced to minimize the life cycle maintenance costs for FAA’s Long Range Radars. We also explore the feasibility of privatizing maintenance tasks to companies that can perform maintenance activities.</br>
