<br>Title: The Design and Optimization of Modules in Total Efficiency Maintenance Mode for Urban Mass Transit</br><br>Author: Yongneng Xu, The Design and Optimization of Modules in Total Efficiency Maintenance Mode for Urban Mass Transit, Department of Transportation Engineering at Nanjing University of Science & Technology, 200 Xiaolingwei Street, Nanjing, JS, 210094, China, x780906yn@163.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Zhang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: To alleviate the imbalance between traffic demand and capacity in Nanjing Metro, we propose Total Efficiency Maintenance Mode (TEM). The objective of the proposed mode is to improve the productivity of maintenance crew and utilization of rolling stocks while ensuring the reliability of core components of rolling stocks. This presentation presents the methodology of rearranging maintenance modules and optimizing the combination of base and variable modules in proposed mode.</br>
