Title: The Effects of Patient No-shows on Appointment Scheduling Policies<br>Author: Lawrence W. Robinson, Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, 433 Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, lwr2@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rachel Chen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We compare traditional and open-access appointment scheduling systems. Under traditional scheduling, some number of customers are booked well in advance, but may not show up for their appointment. Under open-access scheduling, patients call each morning to make an appointment for that day. In most cases the open-access schedule will significantly outperform the traditional schedule in terms of a weighted average of patients' waiting time, the doctor's idle time, and the doctor's overtime.
