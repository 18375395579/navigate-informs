We model and solve  this problem by deploying a multi-agent system, where the optimal sailing  speed of each vessel is obtained by an iterative negotiation process between  the terminal and vessels. Experimental results show that the model can  significantly reduce fuel consumption and vessel emissions in sailing  periods</br>
