Title: Clustering Telecommunications Nodes: Objectives and Challenges<br>Author: John Klincewicz, Principal Member of Technical Staff, AT&T Labs, 200 South Laurel Avenue, Room D5-3C06, Middletown, NJ, 07748, United States of America, klincewicz@att.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Planners often partition large networks into clusters that represent communities of interest.  Clusters should have high volumes of intra-cluster traffic, be well-connected by network links and be compact in a geographic sense.  In this talk, we discuss the shortcomings of applying traditional clustering algorithms to this problem and suggest possible approaches.
