<br>Title: Rental Duration Distributions and Stock-levels: Why Deadlines May be Bad for Rental Firms</br><br>Author: Achal Bassamboo, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd., Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, a-bassamboo@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sunil Kumar, Ramandeep Randhawa</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a rental system, like Netflix, where a fixed number of users rent one product at a time from a collection of re-usable products. We study transient behavior in this system following the introduction of a new product. Analyzing the usage process for this product, we show that an increase in the variability can allow the firm to set lower capacity levels to meet a desired QoS. We also show that the firm is better off not imposing any deadlines for the return of the product.</br>
