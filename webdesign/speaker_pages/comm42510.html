<br>Title: Sample Path Large Deviations for Networks of G/M/N Queues</br><br>Author: Kavita Ramanan, Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Mathematical Sciences, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, kramanan@math.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Soummya Kar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We establish sample path large deviations principles for networks of many-server queues, where simultaneously at each queue, both the number of servers and the arrival rate increase.  The arrival processes are assumed to be general, while the servers provide Markovian (possibly time-inhomogeneous) service.  For a single node, we explicitly solve the associated variational problem for certain classes of arrival processes to shed insight into the way rare events occur.</br>
