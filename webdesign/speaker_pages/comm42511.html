<br>Title: Improving the Quality of the Assignment of Students to First-Year Seminars</br><br>Author: Richard Forrester, Associate Professor of Mathematics, Dickinson College, College and Louther Streets, Carlisle, PA, 17013, United States of America, forrestr@dickinson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Hutson, Thanh To</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Many institutions of higher education have a First-Year Seminar Program. At Dickinson College, students are required to select six seminars from a list of 42 possibilities. Using standard optimization software, we assign students to seminars so as to balance both the gender and number of international students in the seminars. In addition, we use Monte Carlo simulation to study how the number of seminars each student is required to select affects the likelihood that a feasible assignment exists.</br>
