At Dickinson College, students are required to select six seminars from a list of 42 possibilities. Using standard optimization software, we assign students to seminars so as to balance both the gender and number of international students in the seminars. In addition, we use Monte Carlo simulation to study how the number of seminars each student is required to select affects the likelihood that a feasible assignment exists.
