Title: Electricity Market Operations<br>Author: Alberto Lamadrid, Graduate Student, Cornell University, 419 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, ajl259@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Mount, Ray Zimmerman, Robert Thomas, Carlos Murillo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the effect of the initial conditions for a stochastic program combining unit-commitment and AC optimal power flow problem for an electricity system with high penetration of renewable energy sources. The uncertainty sources are divided by their ontological characteristics, as bounds on the knowledge of the state of nature, and as low probability events.  The modeling of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and deferrable demand is explicitly included in a secure (n - 1) framework.
