Title: Cross-training with Imperfect Training Schemes<br>Author: Burak Buke, The University of Edinburgh, School of Mathematics, King's Buildings, JCMB, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, B.Buke@ed.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Ozgur Araz, John Fowler<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Cross-training is an efficient way to achieve flexibility. We assume that training can be online as demand is revealed, in addition to the offline training before demand is realized. We show that if online training is as effective as offline schemes, offline training decreases as variability increases. If the effectiveness of online and offline schemes differ, offline training may increase as variability increases. We also provide a stochastic integer program to design cross-training schemes.
