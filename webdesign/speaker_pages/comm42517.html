Title: Maritime Repositioning of Empty Containers Under Uncertainty and Data Shortage<br>Author: Massimo Di Francesco, University of Cagliary, University of Cagliary, Cagliari, NA, Italy, mdifrance@unica.it<br>Coauthor(s): Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Paola Zuddas<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a maritime empty container repositioning problem where distances are short, some port terminals do not offer holding space for empty container, and information becomes available close to decision time. Decisions are thus taken based on limited and unreliable data. We present a time-dependent optimization model where uncertainty is represented through expert-based scenarios and discuss results.
