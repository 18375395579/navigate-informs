Title: Lagrangian Traffic Flow Models in Dynamic Traffic Assignment<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas, Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter J. Jin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Existing application of Lagrangian traffic flow models in network modeling is limited to the link state estimation. In this study, we explore a more thorough integration of Lagrangian coordinates into dynamic traffic assignment formulations, such as route flow representation, estimating travel time sensitivity formulations, and other areas where tighter integration between the traffic flow model and equilibrium algorithm can prove beneficial.
