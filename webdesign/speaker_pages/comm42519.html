Title: On the Network Design Problem with Mixed Connectivity Requirements<br>Author: Elham Sadeghi, University of Arizona, 1127 E. James E. Rogers Way  Rm 111, Tucson, United States of America, sadeghi@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Neng Fan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this talk, we present and prove several equivalent theorems to ensure a minimum-cost network to be (K,l)-connected. A graph is (k,l)-connected if removal of certain numbers (related to k,l) of vertices and edges will not disconnect the graph. Based on these theorems, we present formulations and algorithms to solve the minimum-cost network design problem.
