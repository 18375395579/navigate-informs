Title: Optimal Pricing and Production Planning for Subscription-Based Products<br>Author: Ali Sadighian, PhD Student, Columbia IEOR, 325 Mudd Building, 500 W. 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States, as2446@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): W. Tim Huh, Soulaymane Kachani<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk, we address the problem of jointly setting production quantities, single-copy and subscription prices for subscription-based products such as magazines. We consider both the finite and infinite horizon cases, and provide a dynamic programming formulation for which we propose a single stage reduction. We extend the analysis to the competitive case and report on computational results.
