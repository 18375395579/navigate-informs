<br>Title: Forecasting Approach for Restaurant Guest Demand with High Walkups</br><br>Author: Mehmet Gulsen, Senior OR Analyst, Walt Disney, 1375 East Buena Vista Dr., TD_3S320A, Lake Buena Vista, FL, 32830, United States of America, mehmet.gulsen@disney.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hai Chu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Restaurant guest demand arrives in the form of advance bookings or walkups. The ratio of advance bookings to walkups can vary significantly from one restaurant to another depending on the features of each restaurant.  High walkup ratio makes traditional booking curve approach to forecasting less effective as considerable portion of demand is not captured within booking curve. We present a robust forecasting approach that could handle varying level of walkup demand effectively.</br>
