Nogales, Victor DeMiguel</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider an investment decision problem for an investor whose objective function is to maximize her lifetime utility in the presence of trading costs. We study the effects of estimation error of the estimated optimal trading strategy within the investor's expected utility, and we propose several shrinkage methods to mitigate the effects of estimation error.</br>
