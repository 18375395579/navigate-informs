Title: Optimal Timing for Mean Reversion Trading<br>Author: Tim Leung, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, IEOR Department, 500 West 120th Street MC4704, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, tl2497@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xin Li<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We discuss the optimal timing to trade under mean-reverting price dynamics subject to transaction cost. We formulate an optimal double stopping problem to analyze the optimal timing to enter and subsequently exit the market, when prices are driven by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU), exponential OU, or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process.
