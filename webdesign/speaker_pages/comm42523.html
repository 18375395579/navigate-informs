<br>Title: Redesign of the Dispatching System for the Santiago Fire Department</br><br>Author: Alvaro Echeverria, Universidad de Chile, Industrial Engineering Department,, Santiago, Chile</br><br>Coauthor(s): Renaud Chicoisne, Daniel Espinoza, Fernando Ordonez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Response time is a key indicator of the effectiveness of a fire department. We developed a new dispatching system based on minimum expected travel time that considers congestion estimated from GPS transit data. An efficient reverse Dijkstra using binary heaps is implemented, in addition to a web-interface to facilitate adoption. The Santiago Fire Department reports a 1min reduction since deployment.</br>
