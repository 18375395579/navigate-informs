<br>Title: Customer Herding in Queuing Services</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Assistant Professor, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: When choosing between service providers whose quality is common knowledge, customers trade off waiting times with service values. Rational customers also examine queue lengths at two competing service providers to make a decision. Customers may ignore their private information and herd. We model herding behavior of customers, in a two-server queuing model. We find that it may be rational in equilibrium to ignore private information and choose the service provider with the longer queue.</br>
