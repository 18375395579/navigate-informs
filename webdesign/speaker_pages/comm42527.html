Title: Cost Reduction through Operations Reversal<br>Author: Yue Zhang, PhD Student, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, yueyue.zhang@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ki Ling Cheung, Jeannette Song<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Previous research has established conditions under which operations reversal is beneficial in terms of minimizing total variability. We show that additional conditions are needed if the objective is to minimize the long-run average cost. These conditions imply that the features with less variable demands should always be processed first.
