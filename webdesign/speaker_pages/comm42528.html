Title: Cost Sensitive Inpatient-ward Bed Reservation Model for Emergency Department Triage<br>Author: Shanshan Qiu, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, United States of America, shanshan@wayne.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alper Murat, Ratna Babu Chinnam<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Research has suggested that if hospital admissions of ED patients can be predicted during triage with confidence, proactive inpatient-ward bed requests can be triggered early on to reduce patient boarding. We propose a cost sensitive bed reservation policy that optimally manages bed reservations for patients. Our results from using EDIS data of Detroit VAMC indicate significant cost saving potential and reduced boarding under the proposed bed reservation policy.
