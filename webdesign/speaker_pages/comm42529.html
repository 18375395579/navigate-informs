<br>Title: Multi-Product Cycle Time and Throughput Evaluation via Simulation on Demand</br><br>Author: Feng Yang, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Management Systems Department, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, 26506, United States, feng.yang@mail.wvu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Ankenman, Barry Nelson</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Cycle time and throughput are important performance measures for manufacturing. We seek to estimate the cycle-time measure as a function of throughput and product mix via simulation for semiconductor manufacturing. The proposed methodology exploits our early success in the generation of cycle time-throughput (CT-TH) curves for a fixed product mix. Experiment design strategies are derived for covering the product-mix space, and techniques for interpolating among CT-TH curves are developed.</br>
