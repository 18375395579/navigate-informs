<br>Title: Overcoming Time Inconsistency in Efficiency by Relaxing Self-Financing Restriction</br><br>Author: Xiangyu Cui, Prof., Shanghai Univ. of Finance and Economics, School of Statistics and Management, Shanghai, China, cui.xiangyu@mail.shufe.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Duan Li</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The dynamic mean-variance model for markets with all risky assets is not time consistent in efficiency, i.e., the pre-committed policy, which is optimal for the entire investment horizon, could become inefficient when considering a truncated time-horizon problem. By relaxing self-finance restriction and allowing to invest only part of current wealth in the market, we develop a revised dynamic mean-variance policy and compare it with the pre-committed policy and the time consistent policy.</br>
