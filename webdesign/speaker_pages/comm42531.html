Title: Index Priority Rules with Variable Job Processing Times<br>Author: George Kyparisis, Florida International University, 11200 SW 8th Street, Miami, FL, 33199, United States of America, kyparis@fiu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider single-machine makespan minimization problems with time-dependent job processing times given by  general multiplicative/additive functional forms. We show that the linear function is the only function leading to an index priority rule   for such problems with  multiplicative/additive job deterioration functions.
