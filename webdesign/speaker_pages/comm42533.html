Title: Beyond Risk-neutrality in Attacker-defender Games<br>Author: Victor Richmond Jose, Georgetown University, McDonough School of Business, Washington, DC, United States of America, vrj2@georgetown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhuang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Traditional models of attacker-defender (AD) games typically assume that players are risk-neutral.  Behavioral research however has shown that individuals often violate risk-neutrality.  In this talk, we consider how the use of alternative decision making frameworks, namely expected utility and prospect theories, affects the equilibrium behavior of players in AD games. We then demonstrate how certain results may no longer hold when risk-neutrality is dropped in favor of these theories.
