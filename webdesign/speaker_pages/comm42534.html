Title: Freight Routing and Containerization in a Parcel Network with Sortation Constraints and Costs<br>Author: Randolph Hall, Professor (ISE), Vice Provost, USC, Main Campus, LA, CA, United States of America, rwhall@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Apichat Chayanupatkul<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This research investigates parcel routing in a network with sorting costs and sorting capacity constraints.  Containerization enables shipments to bypass sorting through direct transfer from incoming vehicles to outgoing vehicles, thus permitting more shipments to be processed within available sorting capacity and reducing the cost of sorting shipments.
