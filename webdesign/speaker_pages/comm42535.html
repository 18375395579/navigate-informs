<br>Title: Flow Balancing with Uncertain Demand for Cross-Docking Facilities</br><br>Author: Luis Novoa, PhD Student - Decision Sciences, The George Washington University, 2201 G Street, NW, Duquès Hall, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, ljnovoa@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ahmad Jarrah, David Morton</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Packages arriving at a facility are routed by primary sorters to secondary sorters based on the freight’s final destination.  We look at the problem of assigning package destinations to secondary sorters in a fashion that balances the workload within the facility while incorporating the day-to-day volume fluctuation.  Robustness of the operation will be assessed based on solutions from a stochastic optimization model and a deterministic optimization one that assumes average package volumes.</br>
