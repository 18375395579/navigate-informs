Title: Filling in the Component Ratings That the Users Left Out<br>Author: Nachiketa Sahoo, Heinz School, Carnegie Mellon University, 4800 Forbes ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, nsahoo@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ramayya Krishnan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Collection of multi-component ratings from the users often results in missing values for the components. A dataset collected from Yahoo! Movies shows that 32% of the records had missing values for the component ratings. We demonstrate a method to elicit user-ratings for these components from the user's and his peersâ€?other observed ratings. We also argue that this task is a generalization of the task of predicting unknown ratings in one component rating collaborative filtering.
