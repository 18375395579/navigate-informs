A dataset collected from Yahoo! Movies shows that 32% of the records had missing values for the component ratings. We demonstrate a method to elicit user-ratings for these components from the user's and his peersâ€?other observed ratings. We also argue that this task is a generalization of the task of predicting unknown ratings in one component rating collaborative filtering.</br>
