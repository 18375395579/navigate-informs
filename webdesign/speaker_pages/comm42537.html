Increased availability of historical and real-time flight information enables freight forwarders to avoid congestion and reduce costs by effectively routing their time-sensitive shipments on both the road and the air transport networks. While the static and dynamic routing on the road networks has been studied extensively, the routing of air cargo on the multimodal air-road networks is unexplored and presents unique challenges as well as opportunities. We address this gap by considering multiple air cargo shipments from geographically dispersed customer locations and investigate the freight forwarder's operational implementation of alternative access airport policy (AAAP) in a multi-airport region (MAR). Given a set of heterogeneous customers, the forwarder's problem is to simultaneously plan for air cargo flight itineraries and the pickup and delivery of customer loads to the airport(s). This problem generalizes the well-known pickup and delivery problems with time and destination dependent delivery costs. An efficient solution method based on successive subproblem solving is developed. The results of computational experiments and a practical case study demonstrate the merits of the AAAP and show that the proposed methodology is very efficient and effective.
