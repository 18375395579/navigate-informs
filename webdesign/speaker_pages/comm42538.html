Title: Optimal NFL Survivor<br>Author: Eric Huggins, Assistant Professor of Management, Fort Lewis College, 1000 Rim Drive, Durango, CO, 81301, United States, huggins_e@fortlewis.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: NFL Survivor is a game where players try to choose one winning team each week for the 17 week NFL season, without choosing the same team twice.  Players that pick a losing team are eliminated until one winner (survivor) remains.  We show that a greedy algorithm, picking the best team each week, is near (but not necessarily) optimal and discuss heuristic strategies.  We also discuss results for a generalized version of the game.
