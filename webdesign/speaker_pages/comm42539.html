Title: Optimal Hiring and Job Assignment<br>Author: Martin Reiman, DMTS, Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, 600 Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ, 07974, United States of America, marty@research.bell-labs.com<br>Coauthor(s): Yue Jin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a model with two types of workers, novices and experts, who process a Poisson stream of jobs. The available controls involve hiring of novice workers and assignment of jobs to workers. Novices are promoted after sufficient work experience, and all workers eventually retire. This problem decomposes naturally into two time scales, motivating the use of results from nearly completely decomposable Markov decision processes in our analysis.
