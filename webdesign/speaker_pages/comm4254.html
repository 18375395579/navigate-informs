Title: A Value Proposition for Elevated Sensors<br>Author: Daniel Wilson, Senior Principal Systems Engineer, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, 225 Presidential Way, Woburn, MA, 01801, United States of America, Daniel.D.Wilson@raytheon.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Given the ever increasing demand for surveillance data, elevated sensors provide a cost effective contribution to any sensor portfolio due to their ability to cover large areas (reduced line-of-sight limitations).  However, this correspondingly increases the risks incurred from an ever-growing reliance on limited numbers of ISR platforms.  Thus utility theory yields an obvious mechanism to articulate a value proposition for elevated sensors given their capabilities, costs and vulnerabilities.
