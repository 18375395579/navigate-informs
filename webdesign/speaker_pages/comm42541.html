We consider email scheduling as a lot sizing problem in which knowledge workers' time is the resource to be allocated to process emails and other daily tasks. Processing emails has some cost similar to production costs, postponing emails incurs some costs similar to penalty costs, and incoming emails are the uncertain demand in the model. We use stochastic linear programming with recourse to solve this problem.</br>
