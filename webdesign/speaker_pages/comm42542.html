Title: Matchings in Connection with Ground Delay and Airspace Flow Programs<br>Author: Thomas Vossen, Assistant Professor, University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business, UCB419, Boulder, CO, 80309, United States, Thomas.Vossen@Colorado.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball, Geir Dahl<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This presentation discusses matchings that arise within the allocation of airport arrival slots during Ground Delay Programs and airspace entry time slots during so-called Airspace Flow Programs, which have recently been proposed for managing en-route congestion. We introduce procedures for allocating flights to slots, discuss fundamental properties of the resulting matchings, and describe how the resulting methods can be used to determine which flights should be canceled or rerouted.
