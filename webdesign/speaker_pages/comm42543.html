<br>Title: Improving Portfolio Performance by Constraining the Portfolio Norm</br><br>Author: Victor DeMiguel, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Regents Park, London, NW14SA, United Kingdom, avmiguel@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Francisco J. Nogales</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: To reduce the impact of estimation error on portfolio performance, we propose computing the portfolios that minimize the sample variance subject to the additional constraint that the norm of the portfolio-weight vector must be smaller than a certain threshold. We show that these portfolios generalize several policies from the literature. Our empirical  results show that the proposed portfolios perform very well out-of-sample.</br>
