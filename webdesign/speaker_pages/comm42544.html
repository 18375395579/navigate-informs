Title: Joint Optimization Models for Assemble-to-order System Replenishment and Allocation<br>Author: Kai Huang, Assistant Professor in Operations Management, Technology University of Eindhoven, Pav.

We establish stochastic programming models for the classical criteria of minimizing expected overall holding cost and backlogging cost. Numerical experiment results are compared with previous results under criteria of maximizing overall reward within a time window. We also propose a series of non-FCFS allocation rules.
