<br>Title: Box-Constrained Inverse Variational Inequality and Its Application in Toll Pricing</br><br>Author: Henry Liu, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota, Department of Civil Engineering, 500 Pillsbury Drive SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55123, United States, henryliu@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiao-Zheng He, Bingsheng He</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Traffic management authority often wants to adjust toll prices so as to maintain a high level of service for paying drivers,. We formulate such problems as an inverse variational inequality with box-constraints for the lower and upper limits of volume/capacity ratios of toll links. We illustrate with a computational example.</br>
