Title: Sequencing Surgeries for Operating Rooms with Inventory Approximations<br>Author: Jiawei Zhang, Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, NY, United States of America, jzhang@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ying Rong, Ho-Yin Mak<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Managing surgery appointments for operating rooms (ORs) is a challenging task due to randomness in surgery durations. We propose new heuristics for the problem of surgery sequencing, i.e., determining the order in which a list of surgeries should be performed in an OR. The fundamental idea behind the development of these heuristics is the structural connection between OR appointment scheduling and stochastic inventory control in serial supply chains.
