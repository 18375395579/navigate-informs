By coordinating arrivals of cargo delivery trucks with outbound flight departure schedules, some of the shipments can be transferred directly to the departing flights, while others will be stored at the terminal's storage facility and incur extra costs. The objective is to obtain a feasible schedule so as to minimize the total cost of operations.</br>
