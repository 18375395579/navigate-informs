Title: Scheduling Truck Arrivals at an Air Cargo Terminal<br>Author: Chung-Lun Li, Chair Professor of Logistics Management, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Logistics, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China, lgtclli@polyu.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Jinwen Ou, Vernon Ning Hsu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the scheduling of truck arrivals at an air cargo terminal. By coordinating arrivals of cargo delivery trucks with outbound flight departure schedules, some of the shipments can be transferred directly to the departing flights, while others will be stored at the terminal's storage facility and incur extra costs. The objective is to obtain a feasible schedule so as to minimize the total cost of operations.
