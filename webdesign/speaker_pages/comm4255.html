Title: Improving Operating Room Utilization<br>Author: Steven Thompson, Assistant Professor, University of Richmond, 28 Westhampton Way, Richmond, VA, 23173, United States of America, sthomps3@richmond.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Garfinkel, Bob Day<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: For most hospitals the operating room (OR) is the largest revenue and cost center.  Managers must balance the need for high levels of utilization with the surgeon’s need for predictable, reliable access.  Many hospitals employ a mechanism known as “blocking?where a given surgeon is granted OR privileges on a certain day for a specific time period.  We develop an optimality based tool that helps a hospital manage block time allocations in order to improve utilization and quality of service.
