<br>Title: Some Simplifying Conditions for Markov Chain Modeling</br><br>Author: Marlin Thomas, Airforce Institute of Technology, Graduate School of Engineering & Managem, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-7765, United States of America, marlin.thomas@afit.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Under certain lumpability conditions the state space of a Markov chain can be partitioned into selected subsets of states to form a smaller chain that retains the Markov property, thus providing even greater simplicity in modeling operational systems.  In this presentation we will discuss methods for construction lumped chains and their application.  Examples will be provided for manpower planning and DNA testing applications.</br>
