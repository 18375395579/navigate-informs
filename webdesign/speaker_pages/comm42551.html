Title: E-Coupons Delivery Problems: A Dynamic and Stochastic Optimization Approach<br>Author: Keumseok Kang, Florida International University, 11200 SW 8th Street, Miami, FL, 33199, United States of America, kskang@fiu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kemal Altinkemer, George Shanthikumar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Location based advertisement (LBA) enables advertisers to attract customers more effectively than ever, by sending location-aware advertisements, which we call e-coupons, through mobile devices. We consider a push-based LBA system and study a profit maximization problem of the advertiser, which we call the e-coupons delivery problem. We formulate this problem as a dynamic and stochastic programming model and find the structural properties of the optimal policy.
