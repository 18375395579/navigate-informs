<br>Title: Statistics for Sustainably Selective Welfare Functions</br><br>Author: Kobi Abayomi, Asst. Professor, Georgia Tech, Groseclose Bldg, Atlanta, GA, 30030, kaa21@duke.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Chichilnisky’s criteria defines a sustainable welfare function as both purely finitely additive and integrable. Classical welfare optimization yields welfare functions that are singular to infinite time or negligible probability events.    I introduce characterizations of statistical estimators for the divergence from a sustainable development path - or utility stream - via a copula similar representation of Kullback-Leibler divergence as a statistical equivalence for the criteria.</br>
