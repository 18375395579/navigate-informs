Title: The Maximum Ratio Maximal Clique Problem<br>Author: Samyukta Sethuraman, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, samyukta@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sergiy Butenko<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce and study the maximum ratio maximal clique problem in graphs, which, given benefit and cost weights associated with each vertex, asks for a clique maximizing the benefit to cost ratio. This problem is motivated by network-based data mining applications.
