<br>Title: When Zero Search Cost is Too High: What Does it Take to Make Consumers Search?</br><br>Author: Peter Popkowski Leszczyc, University of Alberta, 4-20F School of Business, Edmonton, AB, T6G2R6, Canada, ppopkows@ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ernan Haruvy</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine individual choice between pairs of simultaneous auctions that are identical or differ on: (1) direct incentives to search, (2) shipping costs, (3) minimum starting bid, (4) duration and (5) secret reserve. We investigate the extent to which individuals choose optimally over pairs of simultaneous auctions, and what influences these outcomes. Results show that while most individuals do not optimize and switch between auctions, they can be made to search with the appropriate incentives.</br>
