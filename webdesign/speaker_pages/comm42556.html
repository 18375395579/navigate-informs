<br>Title: Implementing Sequential Best-subset Procedures on a Parallel Cluster</br><br>Author: Mina Kabiri, University of Pittsburgh, 3900 O'hara St., Room 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, mik61@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Louis Luangkesorn, Theologos Bountourelis, Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Best Subset Selection (BSS) techniques derived from Ranking and Selection (R&S) methods are used to identify a set of good alternatives so policy makers can choose among them. However, indifference-zone-based sequential R&S procedures are not considered suitable when there are large numbers of alternatives. We explore applying the BSS method to a health-care system with thousands of alternatives on a parallel cluster and investigate issues that arise.</br>
