<br>Title: Provably Near-Optimal Sampling-Based Policies for Stochastic Inventory Control Models</br><br>Author: Retsef Levi, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, BDG E53-389, 30 Wadsworth Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, retsef@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robin Roundy, David Shmoys</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Consider the classical newsvendor model and its multiperiod extension, but under assumption that the exact demand distributions are not known. The only thing available is a set of samples drawn from the true distributions. We present sampling-based policies computed only based on samples and bound the number of samples required to guarantee that their expected cost is arbitrarily close to the optimal cost computed based on the true distributions. The bounds apply to any demand distribution.</br>
