Title: Complexity of Deciding Convexity<br>Author: Amir Ali Ahmadi, Postdoctoral Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 195 Binney st., Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, a_a_a@mit.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We show that deciding convexity of polynomials of degree as low as four is strongly NP-hard. This solves a problem that appeared as one of seven open problems in complexity theory for numerical optimization in 1992.    Joint work with A. Olshevsky, P. A. Parrilo, and J. N. Tsitsiklis.
