Title: Cluster-based Optimal Location Planning of Urban Transit Hubs<br>Author: Yue Liu, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, P.O.

The model features a bi-level structure with the upper-level determining the hub locations to minimize the total transportation and facility cost. The lower-level models the behavior of buses and passengers in choosing optimal hubs and transportation routes. GA is employed to yield meta-optimal solutions.
