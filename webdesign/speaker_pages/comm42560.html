<br>Title: Selecting Unique Designs in Complex Design Spaces</br><br>Author: Abhishek Shrivastava, Ph.D Student, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, akshriv@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Real problems usually have interacting variables giving rise to  design points that can not be represented by a simple set of variables. Even  when these can be represented with graphs, multiple graphs may represent the  same real design point. We apply a canonical labeling based approach to find  the unique graphs. In particular, we solve two problems - cataloging good  fractional factorial designs, and selecting equipment configuration for a  phone quality testing system.</br>
