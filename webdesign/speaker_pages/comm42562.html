Title: An Optimal Randomized Mechanism for the 2-Agent Kidney Exchange Problem<br>Author: Tulia Herrera, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, 500 W. 120th St., Mudd 313, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, tjh2128@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jay Sethuraman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider matching problems arising in kidney exchanges between hospitals. Focusing on the case of two hospitals, we construct a randomized strategy-proof mechanism that is guaranteed to return a matching that is at least 3/4 the size of a max-cardinality matching, thus answering an open question of Caragiannis et al. It is known that no better performance is possible among mechanisms that return a maximal matching, and so our mechanism is best possible within this class of mechanisms.
