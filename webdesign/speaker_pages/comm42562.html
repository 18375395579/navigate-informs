Focusing on the case of two hospitals, we construct a randomized strategy-proof mechanism that is guaranteed to return a matching that is at least 3/4 the size of a max-cardinality matching, thus answering an open question of Caragiannis et al. It is known that no better performance is possible among mechanisms that return a maximal matching, and so our mechanism is best possible within this class of mechanisms.</br>
