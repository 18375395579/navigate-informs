Title: Scheming the Postal Service: An Algorithm for Delivery Point Sequencing<br>Author: Mariah Jeffery, IBM Global Business Services, 12902 Federal Systems Park Dr, Fairfax, VA, 22033, United States, mjeffery1@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mariah Jeffery<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We discuss the development of a tool for creating sort schemes for the United States Postal Service’s Delivery Point Sequencing (DPS) operation. The tool uses a polynomial time algorithm to assign mail to DPS machines for sorting with an objective of minimizing the total equipment required while meeting service standards.
