Title: The G/GI/N Queue in the Halfin-Whitt Regime<br>Author: Josh Reed, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, je-reed@isye.gatech.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The many-server, heavy traffic limit for the GI/M/N queue was first discovered by Halfin and Whitt in 1981. Since then, Halfin and Whitt's results have been used extensively in research on large scale telephone call centers. However, the extension of Halfin and Whitt's results to general service time distributions has remained an open problem. In this talk, we will consider the G/GI/N queue in the Halfin-Whitt regime. Our first result will be to obtain a one-dimensional heavy traffic limit for the properly centered and scaled queue length process. We will then proceed to establish an equivalent characterization of our limiting process involving the renewal function associated with the service time distribution. Finally, we will conclude by discussing several interesting directions for future research.
