Title: Normative Decision Making with Multiattribute Targets<br>Author: James Matheson, SmartOrg Inc., 855 Oak Grove Ave, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, United States, jmatheson@smartorg.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ali Abbas<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A normative multiattribute target is a deterministic region in the space of multiattribute outcomes and has two properties: (1) the probability the outcome lies within it is equal to the expected utility, and (2) all outcomes within the target region are preferred to all outcomes outside it. These properties lead to a unique characterization of multiattribute targets in terms of the “value aspiration equivalent? which extends the duality between probability and utility to multiple attributes.
