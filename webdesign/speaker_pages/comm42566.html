Title: Parking Reservations in Vehicle Sharing Systems<br>Author: Michal Tzur, Tel Aviv University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel, tzur@eng.tau.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Mor Kaspi, Tal Raviv<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a Complete-Parking-Reservation (CPR) policy in vehicle sharing systems, where a user has to declare her destination when attempting to rent a vehicle. A vacant parking space is reserved for her if one is available. Otherwise, the transaction is denied. The CPR policy is compared to a No-Reservation (NR) policy. We prove that the CPR policy performs better than the NR under reasonable conditions and verify it via an extensive simulation study of large realistic systems.
