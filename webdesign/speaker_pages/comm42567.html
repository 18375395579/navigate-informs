Title: Investment Strategy for Automakers and Electricity Generators in a Carbon Constrained World<br>Author: Boxiao Chen, PhD Student, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, boxchen@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erica Klampfl, Margaret Strumolo, Michael Tamor<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Greenhouse gas emission targets are becoming increasingly more stringent over time for automakers and electricity generators, requiring technology and capacity planning strategies that are both environmentally friendly and cost efficient.  With the introduction of plug in hybrid and electric vehicles, these two sectors are linked.  We present a LP that enables tradeoff analysis between the sectors if they work independently with separate emission constraints or together with a joint constraint.
