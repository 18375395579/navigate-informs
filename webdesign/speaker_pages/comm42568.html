<br>Title: Hybrid Models for Scheduling a Real Oil Pipeline Network</br><br>Author: Andre Augusto Cire, University of Campinas, Av. Albert Einstein, 1251, Campinas, SP, 13083970, Brazil, andre.cire@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tony M. T. Lopes, Arnaldo Vieira Moura, Cid Carvalho de Souza</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Brazilian PETROBRAS, one of the world's largest oil companies, confronts a very difficult planning and scheduling problem: how different products should be transported in a pipeline network to supply market demands and to accommodate the daily production outflows of the refineries, while also satisfying hard operational constraints. We propose a two-phase decomposition strategy, in which a Constraint Programming model plays a key role to produce adequate results to large real-world instances.</br>
