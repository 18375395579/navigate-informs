Title: Steiner Tree Mechanisms and Prize Collection<br>Author: Mukund Sundararajan, mukunds@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Roughgarden<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A cost-sharing mechanism is a strategyproof protocol that collects bids from a set of players, selects a subset of the players to receive a service (incurring a subset-dependent cost), and determines prices that recover the cost of the constructed solution.  We show that previously proposed steiner tree mechanisms, which were not designed with social efficiency in mind, approximate a measure of social efficiency that is reminiscent of well studied prize-collecting objectives.
