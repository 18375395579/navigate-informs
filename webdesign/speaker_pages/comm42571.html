We classify this problem as a modified restless multi-armed bandit problem, which allows for multiple types of actions (different maintenance actions). Using an LP relaxation, we are able to develop index policies that allow us to decide the timing and type of maintenance to perform on which aircraft, as well as select which planes should be flown for operations each day.</br>
