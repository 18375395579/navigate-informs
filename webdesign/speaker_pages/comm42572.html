S. Michael, Dorry Segev</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Arranging kidney exchanges requires matching on a graph. Maximum cardinality matchings are desirable, but the relative utility of kidney exchanges must be represented by edge weights. Setting edge weights within a narrow range that we have characterized precisely guarantees that a maximum edge weight matching will also have maximum cardinality.</br>
