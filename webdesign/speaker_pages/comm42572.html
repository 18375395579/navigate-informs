Title: Edge Weighting Ethics in Maximum Matchings on Graphs for Kidney Paired Donation<br>Author: Sommer Gentry, Assistant Professor, Mathematics, U.S. Naval Academy, 572-C Holloway Road, Mailstop 9E, Annapolis, MD, 21402, United States, gentry@usna.edu<br>Coauthor(s): T. S. Michael, Dorry Segev<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Arranging kidney exchanges requires matching on a graph. Maximum cardinality matchings are desirable, but the relative utility of kidney exchanges must be represented by edge weights. Setting edge weights within a narrow range that we have characterized precisely guarantees that a maximum edge weight matching will also have maximum cardinality.
