A bi-level mathematical programming model is constructed to allow tradeoffs between the spatial design (stop location) and the temporal operations (frequency setting). The stop locations are optimized by minimizing the cost components in the lower level, while the upper level optimized the transit line frequencies by maximizing network connectivity.</br>
