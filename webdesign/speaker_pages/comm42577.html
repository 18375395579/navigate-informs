Title: Modeling of Dynamic System Optimal in Continuous-Time<br>Author: Rui Ma, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 173 25th St, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, mar2@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Ban, Jong-Shi Pang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose an optimal control model for dynamic system optimal problem in continuous time. The model integrates the double queue formulation for queue dynamics that captures the queue capacity and inflow/exit flow capacities.
