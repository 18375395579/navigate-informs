Title: Optimal Sensor Placement for Partially Diagnosable Multi-station Assembly Processes<br>Author: Zhenyu (James) Kong, Assistant Professor, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, james.kong@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kaveh Bastani<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Sensor placement optimization aims to provide the desired level of diagnosability using minimal number of sensors in multi-station assembly processes. Previously proposed sensor optimization methods cannot handle the under-determined systems in which number of sensors is less than that of the process errors. We propose a sensor placement optimization method based on our newly developed diagnosability criteria which is the minimal mutual coherence to uniquely identify the process faults.
