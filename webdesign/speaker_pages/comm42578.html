Previously proposed sensor optimization methods cannot handle the under-determined systems in which number of sensors is less than that of the process errors. We propose a sensor placement optimization method based on our newly developed diagnosability criteria which is the minimal mutual coherence to uniquely identify the process faults.</br>
