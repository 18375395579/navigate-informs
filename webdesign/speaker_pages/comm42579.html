Title: Using Dynamic Congestion Tolling and V2I Communication for Decentralized Optimal Routing<br>Author: Hao Zhou, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., IOE Building, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, haozhou@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Romesh Saigal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this research, we consider a traffic network with dynamic congestion toll on each link, and vehicles capable of communicating with central controller. Each vehicle receives real-time toll prices and traffic information of all links, and tries to optimize its route choice based on its own preference. We developed a model to dynamically update toll prices on each link to minimize overall delay of vehicles.
