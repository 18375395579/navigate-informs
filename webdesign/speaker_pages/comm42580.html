<br>Title: Mixed-integer Bilevel Programming (MIBLP) Approach for Competitive Prioritized Set Covering Problem</br><br>Author: Soheil Hemmati, PhD Student, University of Florida, 406 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32603, United States of America, soheilmn@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In competitive set covering problem, which has several applications, including non-cooperative product introduction, two players aim to maximize their rewards by selecting sets of items to satisfy clauses. Each selected item incurs a cost to players and each clause is satisfied by the highest-priority selected item, yielding a reward for the player that introduced the item. We propose an MIBLP model with 0-1 decision variables appear in both levels, and suggest an exact cutting-plane algorithm.</br>
