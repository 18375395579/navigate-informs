Title: Online Quantile and Density Estimators<br>Author: Raghu Pasupathy, Associate Professor, Virginia Tech, 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, pasupath@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Soumyadip Ghosh<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present alternative quantile and density estimators that require dramatically less storage than traditional estimators, with negligible loss in convergence rate to the true quantile and density respectively. The proposed estimators are constructed by accumulating observed random variates into a grid that becomes finer in a strategic fashion. We will present results on the asymptotic behavior of the new estimators along with some numerics.
