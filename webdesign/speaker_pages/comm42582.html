Title: Optimal Seat Offering for Entertainment and Sporting Events Revenue Management<br>Author: Kyle Maclean, Western University, #1408 - 500 Ridout St., London, Canada, k.d.maclean@gmail.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We model a problem faced by entertainment venues (Theatres/Sports Arenas). Consumers wish to be seated as a group, and if this is not possible, may not attend at all. Thus, management must decide which set of seats to offer an incoming consumer group to maximize the amount of groups that can be seated overall. We formulate the problem as a BIP and show via simulation that it outperforms other methods, including offering all available seats, and a heuristic.
