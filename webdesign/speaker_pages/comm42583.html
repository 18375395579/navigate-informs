Title: MapReduce Schedulers: Performance Analysis and Design<br>Author: Li Zhang, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, zhangli@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jian Tan, Xiaoqiao Meng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: MapReduce is a popular programming framework for the parallel processing of large data on a cluster. MapReduce jobs are composed of map and reduce tasks with tight dependence between them. Due to the large number of jobs sharing limited resources, an efficient job scheduler is critical for improving system performance and resource utilization. We present analytical and experimental studies of existing job schedulers. We also introduce our own job scheduler with superior performance.
