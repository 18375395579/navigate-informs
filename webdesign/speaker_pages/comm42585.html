Title: Multi-perspective Optimization of Unmanned Vehicles Routes for Information Gain<br>Author: Hector Ortiz-Pena, CUBRC Inc., 4455 Genesee St., Buffalo, NY, 14225, United States of America, Hector.Ortiz-Pena@cubrc.org<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Karwan, Moises Sudit<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a mixed integer linear program to maximize the information gain from a team of autonomous unmanned vehicles (UxVs).Vehicles are operating in a decentralized framework.  The mathematical formulation considers each UxV’s perspective of the environment and mission, as information is only exchanged when UxVs are part of the same communication network. Area of operation is represented by a set of grid cells; each cell characterized by a value representing the potential information gain.
