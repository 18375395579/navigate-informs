<br>Title: Location of Quick Charging Facilities for Electric Vehicles</br><br>Author: Yan Li, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Tower B702C, HKUST, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, yliaj@ust.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ho-Yin Mak</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: To overcome limited driving ranges of electric vehicles, quick charging facilities are required. We propose a model to measure suitability of locating quick chargers at candidate locations as a function of geographical location and drivers?heterogeneous preferences. We show the relationship between the facility selection problem and a production planning problem with random cost.</br>
