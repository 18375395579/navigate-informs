Title: Reliability Analysis for Failure Processes under Degradation-Dependent Hard Failure Threshold<br>Author: Koosha Rafiee, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States of America, koosha.rafiee@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Qianmei Feng, David Coit<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We introduce reliability models for a device with two dependent failure processes: soft failure due to degradation, and hard failure due to random shocks, by considering the declining hard failure threshold according to changes in degradation. Due to the nature of degradation for complex devices such as Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), a degraded system is more vulnerable to force and stress during operation.
