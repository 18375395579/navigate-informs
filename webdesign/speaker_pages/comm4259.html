Zhang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a spectrum owner with limited channels, each serving one user at a time.  To increase the efficiency, he can serve both licensed and unlicensed users. While a licensed user has a higher priority, an unlicensed user only uses a channel for a fixed time x, and rejoins the queue for the remaining service if a licensed user is waiting. Otherwise, he can continue for another x amount of time. We evaluate the performances and seek optimal ways to manage the spectrum.</br>
