Title: Dynamic Spectrum Management, A Queueing Approach<br>Author: Jiheng Zhang, Assistant Professor, HKUST, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, j.zhang@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Shining Wu, Rachel Q. Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a spectrum owner with limited channels, each serving one user at a time.  To increase the efficiency, he can serve both licensed and unlicensed users. While a licensed user has a higher priority, an unlicensed user only uses a channel for a fixed time x, and rejoins the queue for the remaining service if a licensed user is waiting. Otherwise, he can continue for another x amount of time. We evaluate the performances and seek optimal ways to manage the spectrum.
