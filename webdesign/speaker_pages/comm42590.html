Rating Features in Support Vector Machines</br><br>Author: Romero Morales, Professor, University of Oxford, Said Business School, Oxford, United Kingdom, dolores.romero-morales@sbs.ox.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Emilio Carrizosa, Amaya Nogales Gomez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose the Integer Support Vector Machine (ISVM), where the feature scores can take only a discrete amount of values. The ISVM classifier can be seen as a collection of Likert scales each rating the level of agreement with the positive class. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation and three reduction strategies. Our computational results show that the 3-point and 5-point ISVM classifiers have comparable accuracy to that of SVM, with a gain in interpretability.</br>
