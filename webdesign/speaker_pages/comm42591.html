Title: Optimal Search for a Random Moving Intruder<br>Author: David Casbeer, Air Force Research Lab., AFRL/RBCA, B146 R300, WPAFB, OH, 45433, United States of America, David.Casbeer@wpafb.af.mil<br>Coauthor(s): Meir Pachter, K. Krishnamoorthy, Phillip Chandler<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Using reachability arguments, the optimal control of an agent searching for an intruder on a graph is considered.  The agent is only able to perceive partial and delayed information about the intruder.  Sufficient conditions for guaranteed isolation of the intruder, before he reaches his goal, and the corresponding optimal agent control policy, are provided.
