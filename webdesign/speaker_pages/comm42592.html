Michael Harrison, Chinmoy Mandayam</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The UFOS algorithm (utilization first, output second) puts primary emphasis on greedy maximization of total resource utilization, and secondary emphasis on greedy maximization of total outflow. Focusing on connection-level models of internet congestion control, we compare the delay-related performance of UFOS with that of proportionally fair (PF) resource allocation. In our simulation studies, UFOS reduces overall average delay by about 30% relative to PF.</br>
