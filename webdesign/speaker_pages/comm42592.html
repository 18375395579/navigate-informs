Title: The UFOS Algorithm for Network Resource Allocation<br>Author: Yang Yang, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, W146A, Knight Management Center, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, yang.yang1025@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): J. Michael Harrison, Chinmoy Mandayam<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The UFOS algorithm (utilization first, output second) puts primary emphasis on greedy maximization of total resource utilization, and secondary emphasis on greedy maximization of total outflow. Focusing on connection-level models of internet congestion control, we compare the delay-related performance of UFOS with that of proportionally fair (PF) resource allocation. In our simulation studies, UFOS reduces overall average delay by about 30% relative to PF.
