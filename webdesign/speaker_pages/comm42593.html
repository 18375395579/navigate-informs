<br>Title: Harvest Scheduling under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Cristian Palma, PhD Student, University of British Columbia, Dept. of Forest Resources Management, 2045-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada, cpalmai@interchange.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Nelson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Harvest scheduling decisions are made in an uncertain framework and current techniques that consider uncertainty impose difficulties when solving real problems. We developed a robust optimization model to schedule harvest decisions when timber yield and demand of two products are uncertain, and described its application to a 245,090 ha forest. With small reductions in the objective function, decisions were less sensitive to uncertainties and protected from occurrences of infeasibility.</br>
