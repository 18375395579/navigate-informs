Title: Distributed Choices in Networks: Routing of Splittable Flow<br>Author: Eyran Gisches, University of Arizona, 1130 E.

Our goal is to determine theoretically and empirically if users may benefit when the population consists of groups that operate as unitary players. We have players choose routes in a network game under two conditions. In one, each user controls a single unit. In the second, users control multiple units which may be split. Our results show that in both conditions behavior converges to equilibrium.
