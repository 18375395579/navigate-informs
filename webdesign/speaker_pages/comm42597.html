Lewis, Associate Professor, Cornell University, 226 Rhodes Hall, School of Oper. Res. and Inform. Engin., Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, mel47@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Douglas Down</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a two station call center. Station 1 is staffed by a finite set of workers that are cross-trained in the sense that they can work at either station. Station 2 is staffed by a finite set of dedicated workers. At random times, customers from Station 1 are upgraded to Station 2. Optimal allocation policies and stability are considered.</br>
