Once committed to politically, legally and financially, these investments are irreversible and thus represent considerable sunk costs. On the demand side, travel demand tends to vary significantly over time and space and across modes. Hence, the risks of cost over-runs, delayed schedules, lower than expected demand and, at times, even financial insolvency. Against this background, this paper focuses on the three key questions. First, how to define and measure the various risk components of a transportation investment project and, subsequently, its overall risk level? Second, in the context of Public Private Partnership projects, how should risk be shared? Third, how should risk analysis be incorporated into the overall process of project evaluation?
