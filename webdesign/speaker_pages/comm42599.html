<br>Title: Structured Maintenance Policies for a Non-stationary, Partially Observable Markov Decision Process</br><br>Author: Ludmila Zheltova, Case Western Reserve University, 11119 Bellflower Road, Peter B. Lewis Building, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, ludmila.zheltova@case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Maillart</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) maintenance model and determine conditions under which the optimal inspection/replacement policy exhibits appealing structure. These results generalize existing work by considering the important case in which the system deteriorates according to a known, time-dependent transition probability matrix.</br>
