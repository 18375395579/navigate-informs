The objective is to maximize the quality of executed actions, and an action taken by a given agent may depend on those taken by others. Since no single agent has a complete view of the problem, agents must coordinate to identify scheduling decisions that maximize global quality. We describe a solution approach rooted in the use of Simple Temporal Network models.</br>
