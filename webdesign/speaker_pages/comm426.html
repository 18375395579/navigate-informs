Title: Distributed Management of Schedules Using Simple Temporal Constraint Networks<br>Author: Stephen Smith, Research Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, The Robotics Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, sfs@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anthony Gallagher, Terry Zimmerman, Laura Barbulescu, Zachary Rubinstein<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of maintaining the schedules of a team of agents operating jointly in an uncertain execution environment. The objective is to maximize the quality of executed actions, and an action taken by a given agent may depend on those taken by others. Since no single agent has a complete view of the problem, agents must coordinate to identify scheduling decisions that maximize global quality. We describe a solution approach rooted in the use of Simple Temporal Network models.
