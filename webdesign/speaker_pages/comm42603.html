Title: Overbooking Control for Network Cargo RM<br>Author: Mikhail Nediak, Assistant Professor, Queen's School of Business, 143 Union St., Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada, mnediak@business.queensu.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff McGill, Tatsiana Levina, Yuri Levin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a cargo shipping problem on a network of locations connected by flights operated on a fixed periodic schedule. Bookings for cargo shipping between origin-destination pairs are made in advance. However, cargo capacity availability is unknown at the time of booking. The problem is to find the optimal accept/reject policy to maximize the expected present value of profit. We discuss the structural properties of the solution and numerical approximation schemes.
