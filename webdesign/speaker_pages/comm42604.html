Title: Revenue Management with Limited Demand Information<br>Author: Itir Karaesmen, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States of America, ikaraes@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yingjie Lan, Huina Gao, Michael Ball<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a summary of our results on the multi-fare, single-leg problem with limited demand information. We do not make any distributional assumptions on the demand but assume only the range of demand in each fare class is known. We study the problem using competitive analysis of online algorithms and prove that nested booking limit policies are optimal. Results on computational experiments are provided.
