<br>Title: A Dynamic Graph Model of Barter Exchanges</br><br>Author: Yashodhan Kanoria, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, Columbia Graduate School of Business, Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, ykanoria@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ross Anderson, Itai Ashlagi, David Gamarnik</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by barter exchanges, we study average waiting time in a dynamic random graph model. A node arrives at each time step. A directed edge is formed with probability p with each node currently in the system. If a cycle is formed, of length no more than 3, then that cycle of nodes is removed immediately. We show that the average waiting time for a node scales as 1/p^{3/2} for small p, for this policy. Moreover, we prove that we cannot achieve better delay scaling by batching.</br>
