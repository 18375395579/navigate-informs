Title: Irrevocable Multi-armed Bandit Policies<br>Author: Vivek Farias, Assistant Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management, 30 Wadsworth Street, E53-317, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, vivekf@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ritesh Madan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the multi-armed bandit problem with multiple simultaneous plays. Motivated by applications to dynamic assortment management, we develop a new ‘irrevocable?heuristic for this problem. In particular, we do not allow recourse to arms that were pulled at some point in the past but then discarded. Surprisingly, we demonstrate via a computational study and a uniform performance loss bound that the cost of irrevocability is very limited for a broad useful class of bandits.
