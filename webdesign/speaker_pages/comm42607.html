<br>Title: The Probabilistic p-Minimax Problem on a Network with Random Demand Weights</br><br>Author: Jiamin Wang, Assistant Professor, Long Island University, Roth Hall 202, 720 Northern Blvd, Brookville, NY, 11548, United States, jiamin.wang@liu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of locating p facilities to serve clients residing at the nodes of a network with probabilistic demand weights. The objective is to minimize the probability that the maximum weighted distance from a client to the closest facility exceeds a given threshold value. We analyze the problem and develop exact solution procedures and heuristics to solve it.</br>
