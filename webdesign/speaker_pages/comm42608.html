Title: Trends and Trades<br>Author: Olympia Hadjiliadis, Associate Professor, Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center, CUNY, 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY, 11209, United States of America, ohadjiliadis@brooklyn.cuny.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We build trend following algorithms based on the sequential statistics rules such as the Cumulative sum and the Sequential probability ratio test.  We draw the connections between these algorithms and the well-known path dependent statistics used to capture sudden market drops/crashes and upward trends, the maximum drawdown and the maximum draw-ups. In fact the algorithms introduced are trend following algorithms and are seen to be most profitable during times of market instability.
