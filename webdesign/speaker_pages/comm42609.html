<br>Title: Is it Worth the Wait? Herding when waiting is expensive.</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study how rational customers choose between two congested service facilities with unknown service value when waiting is expensive. If more customers choose the same service facility because of their private information, longer queues will form at the service facility  and therefore a long queue may be an indication of higher quality. On the other hand, a long queue also implies more waiting time to obtain the service. Surprisingly, herding behavior is more pronounced when arrival rate is low.</br>
