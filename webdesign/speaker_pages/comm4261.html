Title: ARD: An Automated Replication-Deletion Method for Simulation Analysis<br>Author: Emily K. Lada, SAS Institute, United States of America, Emily.Lada@sas.com<br>Coauthor(s): Anup Mokashi, James Wilson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: ARD is an automated replication-deletion procedure for computing point and confidence interval (CI) estimators for the steady-state mean of a simulation-generated output process.  In an extensive experimental performance evaluation, ARD’s CIs closely conformed to given coverage and precision requirements but generally required a larger computing budget than single-run procedures.
