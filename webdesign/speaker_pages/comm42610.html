Title: Modeling Make-to-stock and Make-to-order Systems with Multi-server Queues<br>Author: Zhe George Zhang, Professor, Western Washington University, Department of Decision Sciences, 516 High Street, Bellingham, WA, 98225, United States of America, george.zhang@wwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ilhyung Kim, Gangshu Cai<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this research, we investigate a manufacturing system combining make-to-order and make-to-stock operations with random demand by utilizing multi-server queueing model with server vacations. With such a model, the issue of capacity allocation and inventory control is addressed. Using approximations and bounds, we develop some closed form solutions to the optimal policy parameters. Numerical examples are presented to show the accuracy of these formulas.
