Title: Analysis of Inventory Problems with Inventory-dependent Demand<br>Author: Frank (Youhua) Chen, Professor, City University of Hong Kong, College of Business, Dept of Management Science, Kowloonton, 000, Hong Kong - PRC, youhchen@cityu.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Yi Yang, Weili Xue<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We attempt to address a set of problems in which underlying demand depends on the (displayed) inventory level. Generally, inventory as a demand determinant is just one of the many sales levers, such as pricing.  Can the approaches developed in the literature of inventory-pricing be extended to analyze the current problems?  In this talk we examine periodic-review systems where inventories may be displayed on shelf or stored in backroom and present structural results.
