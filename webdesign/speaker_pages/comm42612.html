In this decentralized, dynamic environment, accessibility may suffer in comparison to a system where a single planner locates facilities to optimize access for all. Centralized models are complicated by parameter uncertainty and efficiency ?equity tradeoffs. We propose methods to address these challenges and apply them to cholera treatment facility location in Haiti.</br>
