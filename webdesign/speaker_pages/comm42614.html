Title: Dynamic Analysis of Multi-Item Freight Consolidation<br>Author: M. Ali Ulku, PhD Candidate, Department of Management Sciences, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, N2L 3G1, Waterloo, ON, Canada, maulku@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): James H. Bookbinder<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consolidation is a common practice: Small shipments are aggregated and dispatched in the same load. We consider stochastic arrivals of items varying in size and cost parameters. Via dynamic programming, we analyze the optimality structures of shipment consolidation policies based on expected total cost/unit volume, and sensitivities to truck capacity and length of holding period.
