Freight from incoming trailers must be sorted and loaded into outbound trailers. We concentrate on assigning trucks to doors to avoid congestion on the floor and improving the use/cost of the workforce. Our prototype system assigns trailers dynamically through a workday, updating the loading/unloading operations and solving quadratic door assignment models. It has been tested on realistic data from one company.</br>
