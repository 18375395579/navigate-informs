Title: Dynamic Pricing for Hotel Management with Multiple-day Stays<br>Author: Yun Fong Lim, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, 50 Stamford Road, 178899, Singapore, yflim@smu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Qing Ding, Kum Khiong Yang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a hotel with a single type of rooms. Customers check the rental rate of a room for a multiple-day period. Depending on the availability and rental rate of a room each customer may make a reservation or turn away. The rental rate is updated according to demand   and the remaining capacity of the hotel. We propose a model to dynamically determine the rental rate so that the hotel's revenue is maximized.
