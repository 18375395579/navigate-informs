<br>Title: Complete Solution for the Stationary Queue-length Distribution of a Bulk Arrival/Bulk Service Queue</br><br>Author: Leo Cordeau, Department of Math and Computer Science, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, On, K7K 7B4, Canada, Leo.Cordeau@rmc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mohan Chaudhry</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Using level crossing arguments, relationships between pre-arrival, random, and post-departure epoch queue-length probabilities, for a bulk arrival / bulk service queue, are developed. Next, the roots method is used to invert the probability generating function for the stationary pre-arrival queue-length distribution. Then, given arbitrary inter-arrival times, arrival group size and service group size, a complete solution for the stationary queue-length probabilities is determined.</br>
