Puterman, Maurice Queyranne</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a method for scheduling multi-priority patients to a diagnostic facility in a public health setting. Rather than maximize revenue, the resource manager seeks to allocate capacity so that waiting time targets are met.  Our research involves modeling the scheduling process as an MDP and applying approximate dynamic programming methods. We present the optimal linear approximation for two cost structures as well as the resulting booking policy for achieving the waiting time targets.</br>
