Title: Instantaneous Dynamic User Equilibrium: A Case Study<br>Author: Rui Ma, Research Assistant, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street, JEC 5107, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, mar2@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuegang Ban<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We show how the instantaneous dynamic user equilibrium model can be applied to solve a real traffic network problem. Model results are compared with real world observations with some interesting findings.
