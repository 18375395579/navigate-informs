Title: Solution of the Univariate Discrete Moment Problem for New Classes of Functions<br>Author: Mariya Naumova, RUTCOR, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Rd, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, mnaumova@rci.rutgers.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We characterize the dual feasible bases, in connection with univariate discrete moment problem for classes of objective function not dealt with until now. The new classes include, e.g., step functions with finite number of values. Applications will be mentioned to engineering design and finance.
