Title: Analyzing the Impact of US Rail Transportation Network on Building a Sustainable Bioenergy Feedstock<br>Author: Sandra Eksioglu, Mississippi State University, PO Box 9542, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, United States of America, sde47@ise.msstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Md Roni<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop models to optimize the transportation network for densified biomass from the preprocessing locations to existing coal plants for co-fire. The model takes into account the availability, seasonality and location of biomass throughout the US; and the incentive allowances offered by railway companies for efficient usage of their equipment.
