<br>Title: Intelligent Delay Prediction for MANET Routing</br><br>Author: Zhihao Guo, PhD Candidate, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Olin 613, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, zhihao.guo@case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Behnam Malakooti</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we present a delay prediction mechanism using artificial neural network techniques. By incorporating our delay prediction mechanism into any proactive MANET routing protocols, we expect to realize better routing information exchange efficiency, more accurate routing decision making, and more balanced bandwidth utilization. Our prediction approach can similarly be applied to other routing metrics (e.g., residual energy) to support multi-criteria routing.</br>
