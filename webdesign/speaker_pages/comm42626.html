Title: The Downside Risk-averse Center on a Network<br>Author: Jiamin Wang, Long Island University, Long Island, NY, United States of America, Jiamin.Wang@liu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider finding a location that minimizes the maximum expected weighted distance to the nodes of a network with random demand weights. This problem is similar to the classical center problem except VAR, a downside risk-averse measure, is adopted as a constraint. We derive a set of dominant points and develop algorithms for demand weights of discrete and continuous probability distributions. This study provides a better understanding of the impact of risk attitude on location decisions.
