The problem becomes intractable when demand is uncertain. We assume a factor-based demand and introduce a robust optimization model that minimizes the worst-case expected travel under distributional ambiguity.  By restricting to a linear decision rule, we can derive an efficient policy.  The results are verified via numerical studies.</br>
