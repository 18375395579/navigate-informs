<br>Title: Multi-hospital Kidney Exchange: Dynamic Matching in a Heterogenous System</br><br>Author: Vahideh Manshadi, Postdoc, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Bldg. E40-113, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, manshadi@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Jaillet, Itai Ashlagi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Matching algorithms are major tools for kidney exchange programs and different programs use different algorithms. A major unresolved concern is the tradeoff between waiting time and number of matches. In this work we begin to develop mechanisms for kidney exchange in large kidney exchange programs in a dynamic setting. Our goal is to devise allocation rules for which the average waiting time of pairs is small and at the same time, the total number of exchanges is large.</br>
