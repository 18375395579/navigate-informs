Stands that are harvested before they burn provide fibre and also act as firebreaks that reduce the flammability of the forest and the likelihood that the residual stands will burn before they are harvested. We develop a set of fire ignition and spread scenarios and illustrate the use of progressive hedging methods to solve such problems by applying them to a small hypothetical forest landscape.</br>
