It is the first method (to our knowledge) to guarantee accuracy when knowledge about the model tree, i.e., bounds on the edge lengths, is not assumed. Second, our algorithm guarantees that, with high probability, no false assertions are made; instead, the algorithm produces a maximal edge-disjoint subforest of the model tree.</br>
