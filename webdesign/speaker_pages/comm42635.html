Title: Service Systems with Finite and Heterogeneous Customer Arrivals<br>Author: Rowan Wang, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, wang1075@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Oualid Jouini, Saif Benjaafar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider service systems with a finite number of customer arrivals, where customer inter-arrival times and service times are both stochastic and heterogeneous. We obtain various performance measures of interest including waiting time and makespan. We carry out extensive numerical experiments to examine the effect of heterogeneity in inter-arrival and service times. We derive several managerial insights and discuss implications for settings where such features can be induced.
