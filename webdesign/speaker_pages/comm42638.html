Title: Automatic Updating of Times Remaining in Surgical Cases using Bayesian Analysis of Historical Data<br>Author: Franklin Dexter, Professor, University of Iowa, Anesthesia 6JCP, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, franklin-dexter@uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We derived conditional Bayesian lower prediction bounds of surgical cases?durations, conditional on times ongoing. Posterior predictive distributions follow exp(scaled Student t distribution) and depend on scheduled times and parameters from historical data. Every 5 min, Structured Query Language runs on the anesthesia information management system’s database server. The operating room whiteboard up-time is >99.3%. There are no interruptions (phone calls) and no potential for gaming estimates.
