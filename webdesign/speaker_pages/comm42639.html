Title: Coordinating Anesthesia Appointments and Scheduling Milestones Using Enterprise-Wide Scheduling<br>Author: Franklin Dexter, Professor, University of Iowa, Dept. of Anesthesia, 6JCP, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, franklin-dexter@uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We implemented scheduling of anesthetics outside of operating rooms by clerks and nurses from other departments using the hospital’s enterprise-wide scheduling system. Experimental studies investigated how tabular and graphical displays affected the scheduling of milestones (e.g., NPO times) and appointments before anesthetics. Results apply to other problems of patients arriving just in time (e.g., for non-OR anesthesia, surgery, or regional block placement at facilities with limited space).
