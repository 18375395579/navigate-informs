We study the value of inventory level information in integrating and coordinating inventory management and vehicle routing. We formulate a Markov decision process model and propose a heuristic where the key assumptions are that expediting occurs when demand exceeds capacity, expediting affects future routing decisions, and inventory levels are known prior to decision making.</br>
