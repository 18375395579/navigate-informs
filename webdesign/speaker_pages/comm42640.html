<br>Title: A Constant-factor Approximation Algorithm for Multi-vehicle Collection for Processing problem</br><br>Author: Lerzan Ormeci, Koc University, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, Sariyer, Istanbul, 34450, Turkey, LORMECI@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Esma Gel, Sibel Salman, Eda Yucel</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In multiple vehicle collection for processing problem, items accumulate at a set of sites and are transferred through a series of tours of multiple vehicles to a processing facility to be processed. We show that the problem with the makespan objective is NP-hard, and propose a polynomial-time, constant-factor approximation algorithm for its solution.</br>
