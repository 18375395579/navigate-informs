<br>Title: Matching Supply and Demand: Asymptotics and Insights</br><br>Author: Yingdong Lu, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, yingdong@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Squillante, David Yao</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a general class of high-volume, fast moving production-inventory systems with either lost-sales or backorder control. Studying the asymptotic behavior of a random walk with power drift, we provide simple solutions that are close to optimal. We also establish an equivalence between the lost-sales and backorder models when both face a large penalty cost.</br>
