We assume that users are equipped with smart appliances that allow delay in satisfying demands, and one central controller that makes energy usage decisions on when and how to satisfy the scheduled demands. We formulate a dynamic programming model for the control problem. We also propose an approximation approach based on Q-learning and a decentralization-based heuristic.</br>
