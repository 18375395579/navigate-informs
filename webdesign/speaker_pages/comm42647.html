<br>Title: Geometric Embeddings and Sparsest Cut Variants</br><br>Author: James R. Lee, Professor, Institute for Advanced Study, 1 Einstein Drive, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States, jrl@ias.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In general, problems in the Sparsest Cut genre involve finding balanced separators in graphs:  Our task is to break a given graph into two large pieces while minimizing the interface between them.  Depending on the precise definition of these two objectives, different types of problems arise.  We will discuss these variants and their applications, along with the known algorithmic results, and the relationship to semi-definite optimization and geometric embeddings.</br>
