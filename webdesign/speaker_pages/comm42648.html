<br>Title: Dynamic Control of a Flexible Server in an Assembly System with Setups</br><br>Author: Nilay Argon, Assistant Professor, University of North Carolina, Dept. of Statistics and Operations Res., Smith Building CB#3260, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, nilay@unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chun Tsai</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study an assembly system with a single flexible server, multiple feeder stations, and an instantaneous assembly operation. Our objective is to minimize the long-run average holding and setup costs by dynamically controlling the server. We provide partial characterizations of the optimal policy and numerical results on the performance of heuristic policies that we developed.</br>
