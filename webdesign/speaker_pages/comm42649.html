Title: The Stochastic Repeated Fleet Size and Vehicle Routing Problem<br>Author: Urooj Pasha, Høgskolen i Molde, Specialized University in Logistics, P.O. Box 2110 N-6402, Molde, Norway, urooj.pasha@himolde.no<br>Coauthor(s): Arild Hoff, Arne Løkketangen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A new variant of the Fleet size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) named as The Stochastic Repeated Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (SR-FSMVRP) is introduced and defined in this paper. It is a non deterministic delivery problem. Different scenarios are generated with stochastic demand for a given set of customers. The objective is to find the solution with the lowest expected transportation cost for a given time period.
