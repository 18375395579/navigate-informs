Extending this definition by requiring at least r distinct paths of length at most k, between all pairs of nodes results in the r-robust k-club model. This talk will present preliminary results on a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) based model to detect large r-robust 2-clubs in random graphs with probabilistic edge failures.</br>
