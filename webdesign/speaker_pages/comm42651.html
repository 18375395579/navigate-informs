In five experiments, we find that people accord a smaller weight to the time dimension and, hence, they choose the LL-reward more often under uncertain delays than certain delays. In accord with our explanation, we also found that enhancing sensitivity to the time dimension diminishes the attractiveness of the LL-rewards more strongly under uncertain delays than under certain delays.</br>
