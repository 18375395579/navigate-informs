Title: Contingent Weighting of Time in Intertemporal Decisions Under Delay Uncertainty<br>Author: Selcuk Onay, INSEAD, Blv de Constance, Fontainebleau, France, selcuk.onay@insead.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper investigates the choices between sooner-smaller and later-larger rewards under delay uncertainty. In five experiments, we find that people accord a smaller weight to the time dimension and, hence, they choose the LL-reward more often under uncertain delays than certain delays. In accord with our explanation, we also found that enhancing sensitivity to the time dimension diminishes the attractiveness of the LL-rewards more strongly under uncertain delays than under certain delays.
