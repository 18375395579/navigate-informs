This expansion method has two appealing features. First, it is possible to explicitly calculate any correction term systematically. Second, the expansion convergence is proved rigorously under some regularity conditions. Numerical results suggest the closed-form expansion formula up to the third order is accurate and fast for a broad range of diffusion models.</br>
