A more restrictive sorting policy requires a higher acquisition cost, but a lower remanufacturing cost. While the remanufacturing cost increases with time as the product ages, the acquisition cost decreases. We show the existence of a single optimal acquisition and sorting policy, and the procedure to achieve this optimum.</br>
