We propose heuristic inventory policies--based on local or centralized control and different cost approximations--and find these are nearly optimal within the classes considered. Centralized control performs better on average, but the advantage is small when the number of retailers is small or large. Also, it is better to receive returns at the retailers (warehouse) when the number of retailers is relatively small (large).</br>
