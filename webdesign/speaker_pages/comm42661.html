Title: Combinatorial Walrasian Equilibrium<br>Author: Brendan Lucier, Researcher, Microsoft Research, One Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, brlucier@microsoft.com<br>Coauthor(s): Michal Feldman, Nick Gravin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a combinatorial market design problem with indivisible objects.  We introduce the notion of Combinatorial Walrasian equilibium (CWE), where the seller packages items into indivisible bundles then sets linear prices on the bundles so that none are over-demanded.  We devise a poly-time algorithm that converts any given allocation into a CWE while reducing its social welfare by at most half.  This implies there always exists a CWE yielding half of the optimal social welfare.
