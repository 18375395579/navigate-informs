We introduce the notion of Combinatorial Walrasian equilibium (CWE), where the seller packages items into indivisible bundles then sets linear prices on the bundles so that none are over-demanded.  We devise a poly-time algorithm that converts any given allocation into a CWE while reducing its social welfare by at most half.  This implies there always exists a CWE yielding half of the optimal social welfare.</br>
