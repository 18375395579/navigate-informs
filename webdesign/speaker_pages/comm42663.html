<br>Title: Capacity Management and Patient Scheduling Considering Reschedules, Cancellations, and No-Shows</br><br>Author: Gokce Akin, Ph.D. Student, North Carolina State University, 2152 Burlington Labs, 2500 Stinson Drive, Raleigh, NC, 27695-7913, United States of America, gakin@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Rohleder, Julie Ivy, Todd Huschka</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider an outpatient clinic with demand from multiple patient classes with different demand rates; revenues; and behavioral functions for rescheduling, cancelling, or no shows each of which depends on appointment delay (i.e., time between the appointment request and the actual appointment). We develop a mathematical programming model to find the optimal appointment delay for each patient class, so that the net revenue is maximized subject to clinic daily capacity constraints.</br>
