The objective of the decision problem is to minimize the total expected costs of (1) Opening repair facilities, (2) Assigning each field service location to an opened facility, (3) Assigning capacity levels to each of the opened facilities, and (4) Determining an inventory allocation among the opened facilities and field service locations.</br>
