Title: Optimal Access Control Policies in Systems of Two Tandem Queues with Loss<br>Author: Daniel Silva, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, dfsi3@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hayriye Ayhan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study two queues in tandem with finite arbitrary capacity buffers, Poisson arrivals at the first, and exponential service times. Losses are incurred when a customer is rejected upon arrival or when the second station is full upon service completion at the first. The goal is to find an optimal admission control policy to minimize long-run average cost. We provide conditions for two special policies to be optimal and, for general cases, propose heuristic policies with near optimal performance.
