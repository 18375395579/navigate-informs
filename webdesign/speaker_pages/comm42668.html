Title: Multiple Criteria Clustering and Routing for Heterogeneous Networks<br>Author: Siva Tanguturi, Graduate Student, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, skt8@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyun Kim, Behnam Malakooti<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We develop a novel hybrid, highly scalable and robust routing protocol for heterogeneous networks that considers multiple criteria such as energy, delay, and error-rate to satisfy application requirements such as delay and energy efficient, and reliable routes. To organize the network hierarchically, we present an autonomous and distributed clustering algorithm that considers multiple criteria such as node mobility, rate of neighbor change to achieve maximum cluster stability and load balancing.
