A combination of logistics cost and carbon emission cost is considered in the objective. MOVES model is used to capture the transportation emissions in the logistics activities. The delivery problem is formulated at the tactical level with Continuous Approximation method, which approximates the discrete data with continuous function in a closed form solution.</br>
