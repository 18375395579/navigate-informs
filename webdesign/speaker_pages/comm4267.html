Title: How Carbon Pricing Affects the Efficiency of Urban Delivery Cooperation?<br>Author: Qin Chen, University of Illinois-Chicago, 847 W Taylor st, MC246, Chicago, IL, 60607, United States of America, qchen23@uic.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jane Lin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We analyze the impact of carbon pricing on urban delivery cooperation by comparing the cost of delivery with/without cooperation. A combination of logistics cost and carbon emission cost is considered in the objective. MOVES model is used to capture the transportation emissions in the logistics activities. The delivery problem is formulated at the tactical level with Continuous Approximation method, which approximates the discrete data with continuous function in a closed form solution.
