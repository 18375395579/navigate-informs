<br>Title: Service Disciplines in Location Set Covering Problems with Stochastic Demands and Congestion</br><br>Author: Seokjin Kim, Assistant Professor, Department of Business Administration, Millersville University, P.O. Box 1002, Millersville, PA, 17551-0302, United States, skim@millersville.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman, Dmitry Krass</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the number of servers to be located on a network and achieving the service level at each node at least a required level.  Markovian demands originate and infinite capacity queues are positioned at each node.  Servers can be stationed at nodes and serve calls within a pre-specified service radius.  We investigate the effect of dynamic and static disciplines, and further develop location models for emergency medical services with two call classes.</br>
