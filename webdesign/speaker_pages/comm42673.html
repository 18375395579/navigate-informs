<br>Title: Cycle Stealing and Truncation for Reducing Delay in Heavy-tailed Queues</br><br>Author: Bacel Maddah, Associate Professor, American University of Beirut, Bliss Street, Beirut, Lebanon, bm05@aub.edu.lb</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eman Nasr, Hadi El-Amine</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: To reduce delays in multi-server queues, where service times are “heavy-tailed?(highly variable), servers are arranged into two stations in series. Arrivers, who find either station busy, are served at the first station for a maximum time T. Among this demand stream, those with service requirements exceeding T, continue service at the second station. To this truncation scheme, we add “cycle stealing,?where an arriver, who finds both stations idle, joins the second station. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate superior performance for carefully tailored values of T.</br>
