Title: An Empirical Analysis of Real-time Heuristics for the Dynamic Traveling Salesman Problem<br>Author: Barrett Thomas, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, W272 Pappajohn Business Bldg, Iowa City, IA, 52242- 199, United States of America, barrett-thomas@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Emanuele Manni, Gianpaolo Ghiani<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We compare real-time dynamic insertion heuristics to sample-scenario planning under varying degrees of dynamism.  With the objective of maximizing the number of late-requesting customers served, the goal of our research is to show under what conditions the more computationally intensive and more managerially demanding sample-scenario approach offers significant benefits.  We also explore the benefits of stochastic information in the development of a priori tour for the insertion approach.
