<br>Title: A Simple Network Approach to Ranking Athletic Teams</br><br>Author: Douglas Shier, Clemson University, Mathematical Sciences, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, shierd@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Lee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a method used to rank sports teams utilizing pairwise win-loss comparisons. These pairwise comparisons are represented by a directed network, with nodes representing teams and edge weights defined appropriately. Rankings are obtained by a simple approach: based on the weights of simple paths in the network. Results are presented for several NCAA football seasons and are compared with rankings produced by other established ranking systems.</br>
