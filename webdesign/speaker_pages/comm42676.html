<br>Title: Bounds on the Values of Derivatives Under Partial Knowledge of the Asset Price Distribution</br><br>Author: András Prékopa, Professor, RUTCOR, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, prekopa@rutcor.rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Bounding the value of a financial derivative comes up either because the asset price distribution is only partially known or to compute the value is hard. New bounding methods will be presented that can be used both in the single and multiple asset cases in connection with European and American options. Moment information or knowledge of the univariate marginals of distributions of asset prices are assumed to be available.</br>
