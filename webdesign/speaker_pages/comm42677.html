Each customer may have orders for both products, which should be delivered at once. The time spent by an order in storage after production until delivery is concerned to ensure the product quality. We show that while individual departments determine their ideal schedules, they may omit overall system objective and significant cost savings can be obtained by a jointly optimized schedule.
