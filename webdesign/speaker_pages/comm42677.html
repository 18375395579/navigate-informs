<br>Title: Supply Chain Scheduling of Customer Orders with Two Types of Perishable Products</br><br>Author: Nagihan Comez, Assistant Professor, Bilkent University, Ankara, Ankara, Turkey, nagihan@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chelliah Sriskandarajah, Milind Dawande, Kathryn Stecke</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study production and distribution schedules of a manufacturer producing two types of perishable products. Each customer may have orders for both products, which should be delivered at once. The time spent by an order in storage after production until delivery is concerned to ensure the product quality. We show that while individual departments determine their ideal schedules, they may omit overall system objective and significant cost savings can be obtained by a jointly optimized schedule.</br>
