Title: Robust Topology Control for System Reliability<br>Author: Akshay Korad, PhD Student, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, akshay.korad@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kory Hedman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Corrective transmission switching schemes are an essential part of grid operations and are used to improve the reliability of the grid as well as the operational efficiency. Today, the transmission switching schemes are established based on the operator's past knowledge of the system as well as other ad-hoc methods. The proposed robust corrective topology control tool provides a systematic approach to determine topology control actions that are robust against load and wind uncertainty.
