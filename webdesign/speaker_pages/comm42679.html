<br>Title: Determining Baseline Periods in Statistical Process Control</br><br>Author: Hang Zhang, Ph.D Candidate, Rutgers University, Dep. of Industrial & Systems Eng., Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, zhangh@eden.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Susan Albin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying SPC baseline data. Usually we have to determine baseline periods from long-time historical data comprising data of baseline and unsuccessful periods. We propose a distribution-robust method to choose reasonably long enough baseline periods, where the quality has stable distribution and is the best.</br>
