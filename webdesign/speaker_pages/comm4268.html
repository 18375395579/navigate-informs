King</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Hospital pharmacies throughout the United States are experiencing drug inventory problems that result in waste and shortages.  We consider the pharmacist's role in managing drug inventory.  We formulate their decision as a Markov decision process which determines the optimal inventory policy as a function of the state of the hospital as defined by patient condition and mix.</br>
