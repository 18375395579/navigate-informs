Title: Cooperative Time Window Generation for Containers Delivery/Pick-Up<br>Author: Hossein Jula, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University-Harrisburg, W-256 Olmsted Building, 777 Harrisburg Pike, Middletown, PA, 17057-4898, United States, hjula@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anastasios Chassiakos, Petros Ioannou<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Recently, a few container terminals at the Los Angeles/Long Beach complex port have implemented an appointment window system to manage the flow of trucks in and out of the terminals. In this paper, we propose a structure and develop an algorithm to generate cooperative time windows between container terminals and carrier companies. The appointment system is modeled analytically and an optimization technique is proposed. Simulation experiments are used to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm.
