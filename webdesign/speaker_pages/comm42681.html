<br>Title: The Variable Radius Covering Problem</br><br>Author: Oded Berman, Professor, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, Berman@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): George O. Wesolowsky, Dmitry Krass, Zvi Drezner</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a covering problem where the covering radius of a facility is controlled by a decision maker. The problem is to cover all demand points at a minimum cost by finding optimal number, locations and coverage radii for the facilities. Both, the planar and network versions of the model are considered.</br>
