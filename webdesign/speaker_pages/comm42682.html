<br>Title: Discrete Location with Discrete Choice</br><br>Author: Chung-Piaw Teo, Associate Professor, National University of Singapore, Business School, 21 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119077, Singapore, bizteocp@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Consider a discrete facility location problem where each consumer has a random utility attached to each facility. Given a set of opened facilities, the consumer will choose which facility she wants to be served in. We would like to find the optimal facility location solution to maximize social welfare, after taking into account the facility setup cost. We use a new discrete choice model proposed recently by Karthik, Song and Teo to reduce this problem  to a simple convex IP.</br>
