You are given a spanning tree  of a graph G=(V,E) and we would like to select a subset of  the edges of G, to add to T, to make T 2-connected. We consider   several different variations - we may require 2-vertex connectivity,  or 2-edge connectivity. The edges of G may be unweighted or weighted.  The complexity of the problem varies from polynomial to NP-hard  depending on the assumptions.</br>
