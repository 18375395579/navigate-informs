Title: A Noisy Genetic Algorithm for Emergency Response to Potable Water Contamination Events<br>Author: Jacob Torres, Graudate Student, Texas A&M University, Zachry Department of Civil Engineering, 3136 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843-3136, United States of America, jmt9442@neo.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Emily Zechman, Kelly Brumbelow, Seth Guikema<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Historical efforts in evolutionary computation have not typically been applied to water distribution system (WDS) threat management.  The myriad uncertainties within WDS data such as demands and storage tank levels also yield uncertainties in the performances of management strategies to minimize water contamination threats.  This talk will show how a noisy genetic algorithm can build robust threat management strategies for the optimal selection of fire hydrants in flushing detected contaminants.
