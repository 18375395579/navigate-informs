Title: Controlled Plug-in Vehicle Charging in High Wind Penetration Scenarios<br>Author: Jeremy Michalek, Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Scaife Hall 324, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, jmichalek@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Allison Weis, Paulina Jaramillo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We construct a MILP model of optimal power plant capacity expansion, dispatch, and plug-in vehicle charging to estimate the benefits of electric vehicle demand management using variable rate charging (less costly than bidirectional V2G). We estimate the implications for system cost, integration of intermittent wind power, wind curtailment avoided, and peaking plant construction avoided.
