<br>Title: Commodity Storage Valuation</br><br>Author: Kumar Muthuraman, University of Texas at Austin, 2110 Speedway Stop B6500, Austin, TX, United States of America, kumar@austin.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stathis Tompaidis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a general valuation framework for commodity storage facilities, for non-perishable commodities. We consider the case of a storage facility small enough so that injections and withdrawals do not influence the price of the underlying commodity.   We allow for mean-reversion and seasonality in the price of the commodity, and   allow for injection and withdrawal costs. To find the optimal actions for the storage owner we present an iterative numerical algorithm and prove its convergence.</br>
