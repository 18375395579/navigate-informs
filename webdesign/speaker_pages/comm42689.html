Title: Detection of Approximate Periodicity in Categorical Time Series with Time Intervals<br>Author: Jian Liu, Assistant Professor, The University of Arizona, Rm 221 ENGR Building, 1127 E. James E.

When time of occurrences of symbols is also available, order and time information should be fused to detect periodic patterns. In practice, symbols often repeat with only approximately equal time intervals. This paper employs statistical method for the detection of such approximate periodicity. A case study from mining industry demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
