Title: Movement Planner<br>Author: Srinivas Bollapragada, GE Global Research, 1 Research Circle, Niskayuna, NY, 12309, United States of America, bollapragada@research.ge.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A movement plan is a detailed plan for moving trains in a rail network over a time horizon of 8 to 12 hours. It includes planning meet locations where trains traveling in opposite directions can get past each other as well as pass locations where fast trains can get past slower trains traveling in the same direction.  We developed and implemented a novel algorithm at a major railroad company to automatically dispatch trains to increase average train velocities and save up to $800 million a year.
