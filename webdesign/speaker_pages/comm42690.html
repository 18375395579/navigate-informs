Title: Accuracy of State Space Collapse for Earliest-Deadline-First Queues<br>Author: John Lehoczky, Professor of Statistics, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, jpl@stat.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Shreve, Lukasz Kruk<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a real-time queueing system in which the customers have deadlines, and the performance measure is the fraction of customers who meet their deadlines using the earliest-deadline-first queue discipline. This paper first reviews the heavy traffic approximation of the system's performance.  The main result is the development of a second-order analysis that gives the accuracy of the heavy traffic approximation and the rate of convergence to the heavy traffic limit.
