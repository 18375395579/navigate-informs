Thomas, Philip Jones<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In the face of rising world sugar prices, the logistics of sugar mills in the Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, are of great interest.  In this presentation, we present a rolling horizon approach to coordinating sugarcane harvest operations for Brazilian sugar mills.  After each random event, we update an integer program to account for both new information and operations already underway.  The solutions from our dynamic approach are compared to a perfect information bound.
