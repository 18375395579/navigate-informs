<br>Title: Routing to Manage Resolution and Waiting Time in Call Centers with Heterogeneous Servers</br><br>Author: Vijay Mehrotra, University of San Francisco, School of Management, 2130 Fulton Street, San Francisco, CA, United States of America, vmehrotra@usfca.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Geoff Ryder, Kevin Ross, Yong-Pin Zhou</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We define agent peformance by both the average call handling time  (AHT) and the call resolution probability (RP) and   explore strategies for determining which calls should be handled by  which agents, where these assignments are   based on the specific attributes of the agents and/or the current  state of the system.  We test several routing strategies   to characterize overall performance in terms of customer waiting time and overall resolution rate.</br>
