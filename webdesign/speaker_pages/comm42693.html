Our model incorporates the imbalance penalty and allowed imbalance bands. We provide the analytical characterizations of the optimal contract from the wind farm’s perspective. We also study how to design the imbalance penalty mechanism from the ISO’s standpoint, in order to ensure market efficiency.</br>
