Title: Optimal Wind Energy Commitments Considering Imbalance Cost and Allowed Imbalance Bands<br>Author: Xiaoxuan Zhang, IBM TJ Watson Research, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Route 134, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, zhangxia@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the optimal wind energy commitment problem. Our model incorporates the imbalance penalty and allowed imbalance bands. We provide the analytical characterizations of the optimal contract from the wind farm’s perspective. We also study how to design the imbalance penalty mechanism from the ISO’s standpoint, in order to ensure market efficiency.
