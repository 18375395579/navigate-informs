Title: A Simulated Annealing-Based Heuristic for Outbound Door Assignment in LTL Crossdock Terminals<br>Author: Hector Carlo, Instructor at University of Puerto Rico, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States, hcarlo@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yavuz Bozer<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a simulated annealing-based heuristic to obtain outbound trailer-to-door assignments that minimize the overall material handling effort in a crossdock over a specified time period. The heuristic was used to determine door assignments in a major crossdock facility operated by our corporate collaborator.
