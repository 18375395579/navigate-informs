Title: Euclidean Hub-and-Spoke Networks<br>Author: John Carlsson, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St SE, Office 130C, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, jgc@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fan Jia<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of designing an optimal hub-and-spoke network in Euclidean space: the “spokes?of the network are distributed continuously over a service region, and our objective is to determine the optimal number of hubs and their locations. We consider seven different backbone network topologies for connecting the hub nodes, namely the Steiner and minimum spanning trees, a TSP tour, a star network, a capacitated vehicle routing tour, a complete bipartite graph, and a complete graph.
