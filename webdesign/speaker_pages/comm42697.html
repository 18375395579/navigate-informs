<br>Title: Learning Overlapping Community Structure in Social Networks: The Leader-follower Algorithm</br><br>Author: Tauhid Zaman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, zlisto@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Devavrat Shah</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present the leader-follower algorithm (LFA) for learning overlapping community structure in social networks.  It requires no input parameters and has a run-time linear in the network size.  We prove that it has good performance on certain network structures which we show exist in real social data.  We also find that the LFA can exactly recover the true overlapping community structure for many real social networks while more common methods fail.</br>
