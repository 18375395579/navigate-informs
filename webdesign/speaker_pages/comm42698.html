Title: A Complete Polyhedral Description for the K-Median Problem when K=n-2<br>Author: Wenhui Zhao, Graduate Research Associate, The Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States, zhao.108@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marc Posner<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The polyhedral structure of the K-median problem for an arbitrary graph is examined. An extended formulation with integral polytope is presented. Then, we project out some of the extended variables. Finally, for K = n ?2, we project out all the extended variables and hence find the complete polyhedral description.
