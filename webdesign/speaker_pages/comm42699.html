Equipment is shipped from over 50 suppliers around the United States to a warehouse on the east coast where it is packaged into sets. Sets are shipped to the end user stationed at one of over 40 locations around the world. This paper investigates the use of Lean Methods to significantly improve efficiency of the RFI process.</br>
