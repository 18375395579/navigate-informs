<br>Title: Estimating Dynamic Network O-D Patterns with Informed Drivers: Methodology and Large-Scale Network Application</br><br>Author: Hani Mahmassani, Professor, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, masmah@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ali Zockaie Kheiraie, Ying Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Drivers increasingly have access to real-time information but the proportion of those who rely on such information is unknown. We propose an optimization procedure to simultaneously estimate the time-dependent origin-destination trip tables for a large network along with the percentage of en-route users, given link-level traffic sensor data. The procedure is applied to the Chicago network.</br>
