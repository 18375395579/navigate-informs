One set of vehicles is typically used for more serious calls while the other for less serious. However, when all of one kind are busy, the other may be allocated to an incoming call. The difficulty is in the fact that mismatching ambulances to calls leaves the system with the vulnerability of having to allocate an ambulance to a call that it is ill-equipped to handle.</br>
