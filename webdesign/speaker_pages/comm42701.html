Title: Revolutionary Functionality via Evolutionary Development<br>Author: Ron Lindsey, Owner, Communication Architecture, 1828 Cherry Street, Jacksonville, FL, 32205, United States, comarch@aol.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A railroad’s traffic capacity is constrained by technologies that were introduced in the first 1st and 2nd quarters of the last century, i.e., track circuits and voice radio respectively. With more timely train position and speed data available via wireless data, railroads can project traffic conflicts and re-plan accordingly, thereby increasing capacity. Such capability can be done with minimal additional infrastructure and with out taking on a railroad’s current CAD platform.
