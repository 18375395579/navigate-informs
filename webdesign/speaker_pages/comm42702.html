Title: Minimum Filter Placement for Computer Security<br>Author: Cole Smith, Associate Professor, University of Florida, The University of Florida, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States of America, j.cole.smith@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): E. Chisonge Mofya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a network in which nodes communicate by exchanging information packets, whose fields include the address of the sending node and that of the destination node. In the absence of security mechanisms, an attacking node can send packets to another node using a forged origin address. We consider the problem of identifying a minimum subset of nodes on the network such that placing route-based filters on these nodes limits the number of forged address attacks to a prescribed level.
