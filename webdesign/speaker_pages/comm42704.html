<br>Title: Prioritizing Regular Demand while Reserving Capacity for Emergency Demand</br><br>Author: Ying Li, Clinical Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, 4217 TAMU, College Station, United States of America, yli@mays.tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xinxin Hu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We formulate a finite-horizon, discrete-time, dynamic programming model in which a firm decides how to make reservation for emergency demand and how to prioritize two classes of regular demand.  While emergency demand must be fulfilled within the period of arrival, regular demand can be backlogged.  The optimal policy involves developing metrics that measure backlogging losses from various perspectives.  We fully characterize the firm's optimal prioritization and reservation policy.</br>
