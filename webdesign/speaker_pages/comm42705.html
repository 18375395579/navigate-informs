Title: Dynamic Control of a Make-to-Order, Parallel-Server System with Cancellations<br>Author: Baris Ata, Assistant Professor, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, b-ata@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Melanie Rubino<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Motivated by make-to-order production systems, we consider a dynamic control problem for a multiclass, parallel-server queueing system. The production system serves multiple classes of customers who require rigid due-date lead times and may cancel their order subject to a cancellation penalty. Under heavy traffic conditions, an approximately optimal non-greedy outsourcing and resource allocation policy is derived.
