<br>Title: Performance-based Maintenance and Logistics Service: Parts Availability or Operational Availability?</br><br>Author: Tongdan Jin, Assistant Professor, Texas State University, 601 University Drive, San Marcos, TX, United States of America, tj17@txstate.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Performance-based contracting is envisioned to produce the necessary levels of reliability at the reduced cost. We study a multi-echelon and multi-item service delivery network. We present a unified operational availability model comprehending eight drivers, including reliability, usage, spares, maintenance, fleet size, touch labor, repair and reconditioning turn-around times. Contradictory to the common belief, high operational availability can be sustained under near-zero spares inventory.</br>
