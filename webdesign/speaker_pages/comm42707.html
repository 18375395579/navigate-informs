Title: Dynamic Joint Pricing and Inventory Control with Multiplicative Demand and Fixed Order Cost<br>Author: Yuyue Song, Faculty of Business Administration, Memorial University, St. John's, NL, A1B 3X5, Canada, ysong@mun.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Saibal Ray, Tamer Boyaci<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the dynamic joint pricing and inventory control problem with multiplicative price-sensitive stochastic demand and fixed order cost. For both the lost sale model and the backlogging model with non-stationary parameters, we show that an (s, S, A, p) policy is optimal. For some special cases, we show that either (s, S, P) policy or base-stock policy is optimal.
