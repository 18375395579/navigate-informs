Title: Efficient Subspace Approximation Algorithms<br>Author: Kasturi Varadarajan, University of Iowa, 101E MacLean Hall, Iowa City, IA, United States, kvaradar@cs.uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): N D Shyamalkumar<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the optimal k-dimensional subspace that  fits a set P of n points in d-dimensional Euclidean space. The quality of the fit of a subspace is measured by the sum of the distances of the n points to the subspace. We present approximation algorithms for this problem with running time linear in n and d and exponential in k and the approximation parameter. We also consider other related notions of fit.
