Title: Reliable Adaptive Departure Time and Route Choices in Stochastic Time-dependent Networks<br>Author: Xuan Lu, Research Assistant, University of Massachusetts Amherst, xlu@engin.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Song Gao<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Travelers consider the reliability along with expected travel cost. In this work, travelers are assumed to minimize travel disutility expressed as a linear combination of expected travel time, stay-at-home penalty, early and late schedule delay in a stochastic dynamic network. An exact algorithm is designed to compute an optimal routing policy including adaptive depart time and route choice process. Several approximations are compared with the exact result.
