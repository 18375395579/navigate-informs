Title: Network Security and Contagion<br>Author: Azarakhsh Malekian, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, malekian@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Daron Acemoglu, Asuman Ozdaglar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the network security problem and compare the properties  of the equilibrium and the socially optimal solutions.An infection  percolates over the network.Agents protect themselves by investing  in the security.We delineate conditions under which there is  underinvestment in the equilibrium and also show which sorts of  networks lead to more severe market failures. When attacks are  strategically targeted,we show that there is a new mechanism for  overinvestment.
