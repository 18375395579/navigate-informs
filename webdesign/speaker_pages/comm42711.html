Title: Resilience in Passenger Transportation Networks<br>Author: Reza Faturechi, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn L. Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, reza@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elise Miller-Hooks<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A bi-level stochastic program with equilibrium constraints is presented for assessing and optimizing resilience of passenger transportation networks. At the upper level, preparedness actions are taken to enhance the network or facilitate response actions, and response actions are taken post-disaster to restore system capacity. At the lower level, a partial user equilibrium is sought in which passengers choose their routes to minimize travel time given post-disaster system performance.
