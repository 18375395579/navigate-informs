However, patients have the right to join several waiting lists, a practice referred to as “multiple listing. We analyze the question of where a patient should list in order to maximize her total life expectancy under certain conditions. We model this problem as an MDP. We propose a modified branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the problem and provide numerical results.
