Title: The Effects of Information on a Queue with Balking and Phase-Type Service Times<br>Author: Pengfei Guo, Ph.D. Candidate, Duke University, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, pg18@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Zipkin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the models in Guo and Zipkin  (2003) to a system with phase-type service times. We model the  system with no, partial (the system occupancy) and full (the exact waiting time) information about delay. We compute the busy probability and customers' average utility numerically. Our numerical results show that whether information is good or bad for the server or customers depends on the shape of customers' distribution.
