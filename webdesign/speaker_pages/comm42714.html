Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, yfouyang@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Samer Madanat</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents an analytical approach for planning highway pavement resurfacing activities in the case of continuous pavement state and continuous time. It derives analytical optimality conditions and develops a simple algorithm to solve for the optimal resurfacing frequency and intensity that minimize life-cycle costs in a finite horizon.</br>
