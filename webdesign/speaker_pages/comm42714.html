Title: An Analytical Solution for the Finite-Horizon Pavement Resurfacing Planning Problem<br>Author: Yanfeng Ouyang, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 N. Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, yfouyang@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samer Madanat<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper presents an analytical approach for planning highway pavement resurfacing activities in the case of continuous pavement state and continuous time. It derives analytical optimality conditions and develops a simple algorithm to solve for the optimal resurfacing frequency and intensity that minimize life-cycle costs in a finite horizon.
