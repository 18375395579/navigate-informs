Donors decide how much to donate to each program; a humanitarian organization decides between 4 different funding strategies: 1) total earmarking; 2) partial earmarking; 3) conditional earmarking; 4) no earmarking. We find that, total earmarking is a dominated strategy, while each of the three other strategies can be a dominant strategy under specific criteria.</br>
