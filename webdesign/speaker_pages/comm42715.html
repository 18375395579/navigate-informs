Title: Funding Strategies in Humanitarian Operations for Relief and Development<br>Author: Arian Aflaki, Duke, Duke University Graduate School, Durham, United States of America, arian.aflaki@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alfonso Pedraza Martinez<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We model funding strategies for relief and development programs in a multi-donor market with donation uncertainty. Donors decide how much to donate to each program; a humanitarian organization decides between 4 different funding strategies: 1) total earmarking; 2) partial earmarking; 3) conditional earmarking; 4) no earmarking. We find that, total earmarking is a dominated strategy, while each of the three other strategies can be a dominant strategy under specific criteria.
