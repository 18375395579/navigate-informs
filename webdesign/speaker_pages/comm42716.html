Title: Maximizing Throughput of Assembly Lines with Workers Cross-Trained across Work Stations<br>Author: Yun Fong Lim, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore, yflim@smu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Kum Khiong Yang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We find policies to maximize the throughput of an assembly line with workers cross-trained across discrete work stations. In most of the circumstances the system generates higher throughput when workers are sequenced from slowest to fastest, although a significant portion of work distributions favors the reverse ordering. Furthermore, a team of partially cross-trained workers may outperform a totally cross-trained team.
