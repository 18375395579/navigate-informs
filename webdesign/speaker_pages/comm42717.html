However, the main difficulty is to incorporate and control randomness in a direction instead of a point. This paper makes use of generalized polar coordinates and corresponding random distributions, so as to design a brand new Gradient Oriented Polar Random Search (GO-POLARS) that is proved to satisfy the conditions for strong local convergence.</br>
