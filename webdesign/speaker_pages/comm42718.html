<br>Title: Prima-dual Online Algorithms for Make-to-order Inventory Control Models</br><br>Author: Retsef Levi, Robert N. Noyce Career Development Professor, Assitant Professor of Management, MIT, Sloan School of Management, 50 Memorial Drive, E53-389, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States, retsef@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Konstantin Makarychev, Maxim Sviridenko, Niv Buchbinder, Tracy Kimbrel</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consider an online make-to-order inventory model under the cost structure of the joint replenishment problem. The goal is to minimize overall joint and item fixed ordering costs and delay penalty costs due to customers waiting. Future demands are not known, assumed to be generated by a worst-case adversary. We propose a novel 3-competitive primal-dual online algorithm, which cost is guaranteed to be at most 3 times the optimal offline cost, knowing the complete sequence of demands upfront.</br>
