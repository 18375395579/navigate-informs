Title: The Repair Module - A Solver for Short-Term Planning<br>Author: Carl Mitchelson, AD OPT, a Kronos division, 3535 Queen Mary rd, suite 605, Montreal, QC, H3V 1H8, Canada, Carl.Mitchelson@kronos.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the airline industry, some flexible carriers have to adapt their operations to many short-term disturbances to the flight schedule. We present a real-life problem whose objective is to repair at least cost the crewmembers' schedules over an horizon of a few days, given new aircraft routes and the set of modifications to the flight schedule. We focus on the operational constraints that have driven our approach towards solving the crew routes and crew schedules simultaneously.
