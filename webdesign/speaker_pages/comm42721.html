Demands must be met by incoming shipments, existing inventory or trucks from nearby facilities. The problem is to determine a minimal cost shipping (and trucking) schedule such that demands, draft constraints, contractual obligations and practical limits are met. We solve this problem as a multi-stage mixed integer program.</br>
