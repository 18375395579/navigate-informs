Title: Agricultural Planning of Annual Plants under Demand, Maturation, Harvest, and Yield Risk<br>Author: Baris Tan, Professor of Operations Management, Koc University, Rumelifeneri Yolu, Sariyer, Istanbul, 34450, Turkey, btan@ku.edu.tr<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a planning methodology for a firm whose objective is to match the random supply of annual premium fruits and vegetables from a number of contracted farms and the random demand from the retailers during the planning period.  The proposed method determines the farm areas and the seeding times in such a way that the expected total profit is maximized. The profit obtained by this method is substantially higher compared to the planning approaches where the uncertainties are not considered.
