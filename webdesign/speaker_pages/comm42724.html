<br>Title: Classic and Stochastic Online Traveling Repairman Problems</br><br>Author: Daw-sen Hwang, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, dawsen@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Jaillet</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider two problems related to the online Traveling Repairman Problem (TRP). First, we consider the classic online TRP and propose a novel deterministic online algorithm whose competitive ratio is lower than that of the best existing deterministic algorithm. Second, we consider a new variant of the online TRP in which we take into account a stochastic on-site service time. For any constant greater than 5.83, we construct online algorithms whose competitive ratios are at most that constant.</br>
