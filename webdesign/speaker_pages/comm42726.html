Title: Monotonicity Results for a Class of Dynamic Pricing Problems in Queueing Models<br>Author: Fikri Karaesmen, Koc University, Dept. of Industrial Eng., Istanbul, TR, Turkey, fkaraesmen@ku.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Lerzan Ormeci, Eren Cil<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a framework to investigate the monotonicity of the optimal actions with respect to system parameters for a class of queueing-based Markov Decision Processes. We provide examples from dynamic pricing in the context of queueing and inventory-based models focusing on the monotonicity of the optimal price.
