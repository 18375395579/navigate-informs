<br>Title: A Link between Sequential Semi-anonymous Nonatomic Games and Their Large but Finite Counterparts</br><br>Author: Jian Yang, Associate Professor, Rutgers University, 1 Washingtong Park RM 1084, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, jyang@business.rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We show that a Markov equilibrium of a sequential semi-anonymous nonatomic game can be adopted by players in corresponding large but finite games to achieve near-equilibrium payoffs.  Such an equilibrium is parsimonious in form--oblivious of past history and blind to other players' current status, and is easy to execute.  We propose an asymptotic resemblance concept between two sequences of probability measures to achieve this result.</br>
