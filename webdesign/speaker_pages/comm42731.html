Title: Portfolio Selection with Kinked Linear Utility Functions: Some Computational Results<br>Author: Robert R. Grauer, Professor of Business Administration, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada, grauer@sfu.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Best<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Most financial models assume that utility functions are strictly increasing, smooth and concave. Prospect theory postulates that the utility function is characterized by a kink at zero gains or losses. We examine the portfolios of investors with kinked linear utility functions. The computations employ the method described in Best, Grauer and Hlouskova (2007).
