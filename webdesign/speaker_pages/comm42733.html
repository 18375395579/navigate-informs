Title: Multiplexing Patients in Chronic Illness Facilities: Optimal Capacity Overbooking<br>Author: Donald Lee, PhD Student, Management Sci & Eng, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, dkklee@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stefanos Zenios<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Individuals suffering from chronic illnesses require periodic treatment. For example, those afflicted with kidney disease require dialysis thrice weekly. Complications from treatment also cause frequent patient hospitalizations, a significant source of revenue loss. Modeling the system with a migration network, we propose that clinics should overbook capacity to maintain optimal utilization while pooling spare resources with those of nearby facilities to hedge the risk of overflow.
