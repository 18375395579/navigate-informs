For example, those afflicted with kidney disease require dialysis thrice weekly. Complications from treatment also cause frequent patient hospitalizations, a significant source of revenue loss. Modeling the system with a migration network, we propose that clinics should overbook capacity to maintain optimal utilization while pooling spare resources with those of nearby facilities to hedge the risk of overflow.</br>
