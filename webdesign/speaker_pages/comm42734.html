Title: Continuous-time Portfolio Choice when Risk is Measured by Weighted VaR<br>Author: Xuedong He, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, 316 Mudd Building, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, xh2140@columbia.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a continuous-time portfolio choice problem in which an agent, with or without the no-bankruptcy constraint, chooses among the portfolios that achieve a given expected terminal wealth target with the objective of minimizing the risk of his portfolio. The risk is measured by a so-called weighted value-at-risk (VaR), which is a generalization of both VaR and conditional VaR. We finally extend the model to the case in which the risk is represented by a law-invariant coherent risk measure.
