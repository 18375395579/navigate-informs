Title: Managing Inventory with Limited History of Intermittent Demand<br>Author: Alp Akcay, PhD Candidate, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, aakcay@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sridhar Tayur, Bahar Biller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Assuming an intermittent demand process with unknown distribution parameters, we study the problem of estimating inventory targets from limited amount of historical demand data. The resulting inventory-target estimates minimize the average expected cost that is attributable to misestimating the optimal inventory target. We also consider the correlation between demand size and the number of inter-demand periods, and propose an integrated estimation-optimization approach to solve the problem.
