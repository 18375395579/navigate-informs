A complete statistical approach should account for the value of additional information dynamically and in relation to the decision. An Operational Statistical approach is presented to avoid the limitations of both the frequentist estimator approach, which does not generally integrate decision-making, and the subjective Bayesian approach, which requires knowledge that is often unavailable.</br>
