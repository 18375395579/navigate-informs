Title: Last Mile Distribution Problem for Humanitarian Relief Chains<br>Author: Burcu Balcik, Graduate Assistant, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Washington, Box 352650, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, burcub@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Benita Beamon, Karen Smilowitz<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider last mile logistical operations in the humanitarian relief chain, which involves allocating relief supplies among demand locations from local distribution centers, and determining delivery schedules and routes for each vehicle throughout the planning horizon.  We present an MIP model and solution approach for the last mile distribution problem.  Finally, we present computational results and practical implications.
