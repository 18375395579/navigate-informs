Title: Scheduling the German Basketball League<br>Author: Stephan Westphal, Professor, Institute for Numerical and Applied Mathematics, University of Goettingen, Goettingen, D-37083, Germany, s.westphal@math.uni-goettingen.de<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Each season, the German First Division Basketball League (Beko BBL) is faced with the problem of scheduling the games among their teams.   As the classical schedules and models applied so far have caused numerous problems, resulting in postponed games, lost ticket sales and unbalanced standings, we developed a new approach taking all requirements into account. Because of our analysis, the BBL changed their traditional way of scheduling and switched from symmetric to asymmetric schedules.
