Title: Short Rate Control and Implied Yield Curves<br>Author: Haolin Feng, Assistant Professor, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xing Gang Xi Road, Lingnan College, Guangzhou, 510275, China, FengHaoL@mail.sysu.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Kumar Muthuraman, Daniel Mitchell<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a problem where the central bank has a target short rate level. Running costs are incurred as the short rate deviates from the target level. Each intervention of the central bank incurs some costs which have a fixed and a variable component. The objective of the central bank is to minimize the total expected costs. We solve the resulting impulse control problem for various short rate dynamics and study how the yield curves of different models are impacted under impulse control.
