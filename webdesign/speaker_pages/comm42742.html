Title: A Branch-and-price Algorithm for Single-sourcing Stochastic Transportation Problem<br>Author: Fatma Zeynep Sargut, Sr Operations Researcher, Innovative Scheduling, Inc, 2153 SE Hawthorne Road, Suite 128, Gainesville, FL, 32641, United States, zeynep@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edwin Romeijn<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a single period stochastic transportation problem, where the objective is to minimize the expected total transportation costs between facilities and retailers as well as the total expected overage and underage cost at the retailers. We consider the problem with and without single-sourcing constraints and compare them under different cost structures.
