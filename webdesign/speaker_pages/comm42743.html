<br>Title: Bicriteria Online Matching: Maximizing Weight and Cardinality</br><br>Author: Morteza Zadimoghaddam, PhD student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 32 Vasser Street, Csail Room 32G678, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, zadimoghaddam@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nitish Korula, Vahab Mirrokni</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Inspired by online ad allocation, many results have been developed for online matching problems. Most of the previous work deals with a single objective, but, in practice, we need to optimize multiple objectives. We consider a set of fixed nodes (ads) with capacity constraints, and a set of online items arriving one by one. The problem is to assign each item to a neighbor online, while respecting the capacity constraints; and maximizing both the total weight of the matching and the cardinality.</br>
