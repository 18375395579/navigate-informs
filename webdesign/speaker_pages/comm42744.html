<br>Title: Robust Voting Machine Allocations</br><br>Author: Muer Yang, Assistant Professor, University of St. Thomas, 1000 LaSalle Avenue, SCH 435, Minneapolis, MN, 55403, United States of America, yangmuer@stthomas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nuo Xu, Xinfang Wang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recent US elections have experienced long and unequal queues resulted  from poor voting machine allocations. Assigning voting machines to  precincts must be completed months in advance of an election when there is significant uncertainty regarding total voter turnout, timing of voter arrivals, and time to complete a ballot. We develop a robust optimization model to allocate voting machines efficiently in the presence of such uncertainty.</br>
