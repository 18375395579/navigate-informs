We prove the same throughput optimality property for a generalization of the MaxWeight policy called the MaxWeight-({\alpha},g) policy. These throughput optimal, myopic scheduling policies allow for scheduling choices similar to those found in bandwidth sharing networks -- a further well studied model of Internet congestion.</br>
