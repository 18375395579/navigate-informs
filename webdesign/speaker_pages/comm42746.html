<br>Title: The Economic Lot-Sizing Problem with a Remanufacturing Option</br><br>Author: Wilco van den Heuvel, PhD Student, Econometric Institute, Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University, PO Box 1738, 3000 DR, Rotterdam, Netherlands, wvandenheuvel@few.eur.nl</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present an extension of the classical economic lot-sizing (ELS) model. In the ELS model there is a known demand for a fixed number of periods which has to be satisfied by manufacturing items at minimal cost. In our extended model, besides manufacturing new items, demand can be satisfied by remanufacturing returned items. Costs include setup cost, unit (re)manufacturing cost and holding cost. We derive polynomial time algorithms and complexity results for different model assumptions.</br>
