All four prior generations of intermittent demand forecasting methods processed each part in isolation. Gen5 methods discover and exploit demand correlations across parts. These correlations define the social network of parts. Besides providing a new way to forecast demand, this collective approach will also be useful in non-forecasting tasks by giving a big picture view of an entire fleet of parts.</br>
