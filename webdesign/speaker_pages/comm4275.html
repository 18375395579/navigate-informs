The challenge is that the operating cost of the carrier depends on the synergy between the set of  lanes the carrier wins, which is not known until the end of the auction. The emphasis is on modeling the strategic bidding behavior of competitors. We model a problem with  the objective of maximizing the carrier’s expected profit.</br>
