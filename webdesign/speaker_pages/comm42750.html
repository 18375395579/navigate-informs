Title: Optimization-based Tools for Residency Scheduling<br>Author: Amy Cohn, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, amycohn@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian Jordan, Young-Chae Hong<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The scheduling of medical residents is a complex combinatorial optimization problem that is often solved manually by Chief Residents. We present a MIP-based approach that dramatically reduces scheduling time while eliminating errors that are ubiquitous in practice. More importantly, the resulting schedules are better designed to ensure safe and quality patient care and better educational experiences for the residents.
