<br>Title: A Shipper-Carrier Freight Transshipment Network Model: A Stackelberg Game-Theoretic Approach</br><br>Author: Tao Yao, Pennsylvania State University, 349 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, taoyao@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zhang, Amir Meimand, Terry Friesz</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers the shipper-carrier freight transshipment problem by a leader-follower game. The problem is formulated as a MPEC. Numerical experiments are conducted and some interesting insights about carrier’s optimal pricing strategy are discussed.</br>
