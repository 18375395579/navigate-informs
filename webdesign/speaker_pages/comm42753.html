Title: A Periodic-review Location-inventory Model<br>Author: M. Mahdi Tajbakhsh, Dr., Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St. George St., Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, Mahdi.Tajbakhsh@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca<br>Coauthor(s): Dmitry Krass, Oded Berman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain design problem in which facility location and inventory management decisions are integrated. We assume a periodic-review, order-up-to-level (R, S) inventory policy at distribution centers. We propose a Lagrangian-relaxation algorithm and present our computational results.
