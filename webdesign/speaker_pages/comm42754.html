Title: Modeling Overlapping Container Terminal Operations<br>Author: Ren?De Koster, Erasmus University, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, Netherlands, rkoster@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Debjit Roy<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop new integrated stochastic models for analyzing the performance of container terminals with overlapping loading and unloading operations. These models capture the complex interactions among the quayside, vehicle, and stackside processes, and provide system design insights.
