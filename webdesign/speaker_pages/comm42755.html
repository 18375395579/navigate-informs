Box 210072, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States, mhickman@engr.arizona.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: There is a role for public transit vehicles in evacuating low-mobility persons during an emergency. We explore the problem of how buses might be routed dynamically to evacuate the carless. In this on-line problem context, various vehicle routing heuristics are proposed and compared.
