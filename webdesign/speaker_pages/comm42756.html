Title: Inventory Management with Advance Capacity Information<br>Author: Marko Jaksic, Faculty of Economics University of Ljubljana, Kardeljeva ploscad 17, Ljubljana, Slovenia, M.Jaksic@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Jan Fransoo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a periodic-review inventory system under stochastic demand and stochastic limited supply capacity, where the uncertainty of future supply can be lowered through acquiring the advance capacity information (ACI). We analyze the characteristics of the optimal ordering policy and establish a link with advance demand information modeling. We perform a numerical analysis to quantify the value of ACI and obtain useful managerial insights from the study of the specific problem instances.
