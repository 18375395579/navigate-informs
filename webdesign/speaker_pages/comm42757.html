Title: A Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis in Semiconductor Wafer Maps<br>Author: Seong-Jun Kim, Visiting Scholar, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States, skim47@utk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Young S.

Defective chips are likely to exhibit a spatial dependence across the wafer map, in which useful information about integrated chip (IC) fabrication processes is contained. By incorporating a join-count statistic with spatial lags, this paper presents a novel approach to detecting the presence of spatial dependences on the wafer map.
