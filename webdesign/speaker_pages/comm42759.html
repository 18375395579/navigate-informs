<br>Title: Controlling the Autonomously Recon&#64257;guring Stochastic Factory</br><br>Author: Mark Yim, Associate Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 297 Towne Bldg, 220 S. 33rd Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, yim@grasp.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hod Lipson, Eric Klavin, Daniela Rus</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Natural systems create deterministic structures from a variable materials. Robustness and adaptability result from this stochastic nature. We will demonstrate a novel paradigm for robust construction and adaptive recon&#64257;guration of physical systems, under uncertainty and variable resources. We envision processes with resources and targets subject to stochastic &#64258;uctuations. Attributes: autonomy, stochastic behavior, adaptation, distribution of sensing, control, and actuation.</br>
