Title: Design of Warehouses under the Constraint of On-time Order Fulfillment<br>Author: Marc Schleyer, Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering, Auburn University, United States of America, marc.schleyer@auburn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Clemens van Dinther<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Logistic systems have to be designed in a way that on-time order fulfillment is guaranteed with a given high probability. Our research presents a novel analytical approach which enables the determination of the order throughput time distribution in warehouses under various system settings. We use discrete time queueing models for the calculation of the throughput time distribution leading to the probability of on-time order fulfillment.
