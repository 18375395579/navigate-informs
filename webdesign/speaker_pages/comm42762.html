Title: Randomized Supermodular/Log-supermodular Games and Their Comparative Statics<br>Author: Jian Yang, Associate Professor, New Jersey Institute of Technology, University Heights, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States, yang@adm.njit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiangtong Qi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a game with random player types which is in turn generated from an original game involving strategic complementarities. Besides examining the existence and shape of the game's pure equilibrium strategy curves, we determine how each player's strategy curve should change when the game's joint player type distribution varies. We apply our theoretical results to a linear pricing game and obtain many useful insights.
