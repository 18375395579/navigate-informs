Title: A Closed Queueing Network Approach to Analyzing Multi-vehicle Material Handling Systems<br>Author: Dima Nazzal, University of Central Florida, 4000 Central Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL, 32816, United States of America, dnazzal@mail.ucf.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A multi-vehicle material handling system is modeled as a closed loop queueing network with finite buffers and general service times, where the vehicles represent the jobs in the network. This type of network differs from other queueing systems, because vehicles?residence times on track segments (servers) depend on the number of jobs (vehicles) in circulation. A new iterative approximation algorithm is developed to estimate throughput capacity of the MHS.
