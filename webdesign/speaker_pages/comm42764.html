Title: Schedule-based Transit Assignment Using a Bush-based Approach<br>Author: Mark Hickman, Associate Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E.

The proposed model is applied on a link-based transit schedule network, assuming either deterministic or stochastic passenger behavior. Stochastic behavior is represented with the entropy term for each path. For the solution, an algorithm using a diagonalization technique is utilized.
