<br>Title: Optimal Route Spacing and Headway of a Transit Network for Analyzing Hierarchy Structure</br><br>Author: Junsik Park, Post-doctoral Researcher, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C 1761, ECJ Hall 6.508, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, forejs@paran.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Optimal route spacing and headway can be decided to minimize the total cost of a transit network. At the optimal route spacing and headway, the total cost of a transit network can be simplified in a form of travel cost plus non-travel cost. The hierarchical structure of a transit network was analyzed using the simplified total cost function of a transit network. This study shows the condition when a hierarchical transit network is more efficient than a transit network without hierarchy.</br>
