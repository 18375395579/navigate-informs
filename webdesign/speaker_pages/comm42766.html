Title: On the Vessel Scheduling Problem with Multi-loading Capacities<br>Author: Lei Lei, Rutgers University, Rutgers Business School, Newark & New Brunswick, NJ, United States of America, llei@business.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Endre Boros, Selim Bora<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the scheduling problem of vessels with multi-loading capacities. Such a scheduling problem becomes very complicated when the fleet is heterogeneous and the shipping network is large. We present two special cases where polynomial-time solutions exist and propose a heuristic with error bound analysis for a more general case.
