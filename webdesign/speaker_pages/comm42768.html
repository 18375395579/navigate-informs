Title: Inferring Quality from a Queue<br>Author: Laurens Debo, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, laurdebo@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christine Parlour, Uday Rajan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We provide a model in which a queue communicates the quality of a  good to consumers. Agents arrive randomly at a market, and observe  the queue length and a binary private signal about the good.  Service departures from the queue are also random. Agents decide  whether to join the queue and obtain the good or to balk. We study the equilibrium arrival rate and system parameters.
