<br>Title: Fast Approximate Choice of Record Length for Large Encrypted Database</br><br>Author: David Shallcross, Applied Communication Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, dshallcross@appcomsci.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: To conceal actual record lengths in encrypted databases,  we consider choosing a fixed record length.  Actual records  are to be split and padded to form multiple records of the  chosen length.  We want to minimize the total memory consumed.  An exact optimum can be easily be found in time quadratic in  the maximum record length.  We now present an approximate  algorithm that runs in less time, and also some results on  the sensitivity of this approximation to database updates.</br>
