Title: A Comparison of Integrated Inventory/Outbound Dispatch Policies<br>Author: Sila Cetinkaya, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, United States of America, sila@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bo Wei<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present an analytical comparison of alternative dispatch policies in the context of integrated inventory replenishment and outbound dispatch scheduling decisions. We prove that under the same expected replenishment cycle length and the same expected dispatch cycle length, quantity-based dispatching achieves the least inventory cost and waiting cost within one replenishment cycle, and, hence, it is superior to hybrid dispatching.
