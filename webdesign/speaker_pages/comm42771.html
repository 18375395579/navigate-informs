On one hand, locomotive shortage can result in train delays and lost business.  On the other hand, locomotives are very expensive assets.  NS and Princeton University jointly developed a locomotive fleet sizing model.  The model has been integrated into the existing NS planning framework and provides an effective tool to identify locomotive requirements for various service levels.</br>
