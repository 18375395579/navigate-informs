Title: Minimizing Movement<br>Author: Amin Sayedi, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Tepper School of Business, PhD program, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, ssayedir@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi, Erik Demaine, Shayan Oveisgharan, Morteza Zadimoghaddam, Hamid Mahini<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We give approximation algorithms and inapproximability results for a class of movement problems. In general, these problems involve planning the coordinated motion of a large collection of objects (representing anything from a robot swarm or firefighter team to map labels or network messages) to achieve a global property of the network while minimizing the maximum or average movement.
