The externality due to emission is compensated through emission credits (initially distributed among the system users). A stochastic user equilibrium based model (with heterogeneous users)  is developed and the existence of unique equilibrium credit price is proved. Finally, a solution algorithm is provided to implement the credit-based scheme in large transportation networks.</br>
