The aim is to optimize jointly the EV charging cost and the load mismatch risk between the forecast EV load and the actual load due to EVs' random driving activities. To mitigate the computational complexity resulting from the large number of EVs in the system, an estimation algorithm based on importance sampling is developed, which can reduce the overall charging cost by using only a small number of samples.</br>
