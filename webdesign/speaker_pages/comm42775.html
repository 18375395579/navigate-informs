Title: A Lane-based Network Enhancement Model for Special Event and Emergency Traffic Management<br>Author: Peng Li, Research Assistant, University of WIsconsin-Milwaukee, PO Box 784, Civil Engineering, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States of America, pengli@uwm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yue Liu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical model for special event or emergency traffic management by simultaneously optimizing the distribution of signal and cross-elimination strategies, lane markings, turning restrictions, and signal timings in the network. The model features a bi-level structure and is solved with a GA-based heuristic.
