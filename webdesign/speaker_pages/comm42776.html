Title: Base-stock Control of Two-stage Inventory Systems with Periodic Batching Under Fill-rate Constraint<br>Author: Jun Zhang, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, Richardson, TX, United States, jun.zhang@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jiang Zhang, Yuanjie He<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a two-stage inventory system with linear inventory holding cost and a fill-rate constraint. The inventory replenishment at both stages follows an echelon base-stock policy with periodic batching. We develop an exact expression for the system's fill rate. When demand is mixed Erlang, our exact expression only involves the PDF and CDF of the Erlang distribution. Under a general assumption, we show that the inventory optimization problem is a convex programming problem.
