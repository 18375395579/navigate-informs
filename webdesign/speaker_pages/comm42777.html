The analysis of this system for the case of non-exponentially distributed service times presents a significant challenge. We consider the case of discrete service time distributions and show that in the large N limit the queue length process can approximated by a simple discrete time continuous state Markov chain. We then establish an interchange of steady state and large N limits using tightness arguments.</br>
