Title: On the Existence of 0/1 Polytopes with High Semidenite Extension Complexity<br>Author: Daniel Dadush, New York University, 15 Washington Pl, Apt 5N, New York, NY, 10003, United States of America, dndadush@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Sebastian Pokutta, Jop Briet<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We show the existence of a n dimensional 0/1 polytope for which any spectrahedron projecting to it must be the affine slice of an (sub)-exponential sized PSD cone, i.e. there exists a 0/1 polytope with (sub)-exponential PSD extension complexity. This extends the result of Rothvoss 2011, which gave the result for linear extension complexity.
