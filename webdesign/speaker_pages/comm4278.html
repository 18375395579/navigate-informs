Title: Labor Allocation in Automotive Planning: Leveraging a Flexible Workforce<br>Author: Ada Barlatt, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, abarlatt@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amy Cohn<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In an automotive stamping facility, a single workforce is shared across presslines within the facility. We consider the problem of simultaneously deciding the workforce size and allocation of laborers across presslines.  We present a divide-and-conquer approach to ensure tractability and discuss how this approach extends to other hierarchical planning problems.
