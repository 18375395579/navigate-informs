<br>Title: Dynamic Optimization of FOPTD, SOPTD and SOPTD with Lead Systems</br><br>Author: Ali Elkamel, Associate Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, aelkamel@cape.uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chandramouli Madhuranthakam</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The optimal PID controller parameters for first order plus dead time (FOPTD), second order plus dead time (SOPTD) and SOPTD with lead process are obtained by performing dynamic optimization. The objective function was to minimize the integral of absolute errors for servo and regulatory changes.It shows that the PID controller parameters thus obtained from dynamic optimization improves the responses compared to those obtained from conventional methods.</br>
