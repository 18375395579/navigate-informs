Title: Continuous-time Risk-adjusted Martingales<br>Author: Zhengwei Sun, Post-doctoral Research Associate, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Ave., Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, zsun4@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ali Abbas, Dharma Kwon<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Abbas (2010) introduced the idea of a risk-adjusted martingale. We introduce the notion of a continuous time risk-adjusted martingale, a continuous-time  stochastic process whose certainty equivalent at any future time is equal to its magnitude at the present time.  We explore several of its applications and ramifications in finance.
