Communication effectiveness for each sensor pair is determined by a concave function of distance between the sensors. Also, final sensor placement is stochastic, as caused by drifting. We maximize a communication effectiveness metric, and require all targets to be covered by some sensor, where sensor drift occurs according to a robust (worst-case) mechanism.</br>
