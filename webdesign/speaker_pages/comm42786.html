We show that (i) the median shortfall captures tail risk in an alternative way to that of the expected shortfall; (ii) the median shortfall is more robust than the expected shortfall with respect to small changes in the data; (iii) the estimation error of the median shortfall is much smaller than that of the expected shortfall. Hence, it is better to use the median shortfall than to use the expected shortfall in setting capital requirements.</br>
