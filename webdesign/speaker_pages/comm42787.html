Title: Reliability Impacts of Increased Wind Penetration in Electricity Markets<br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Dept. of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engg, UIUC, 216 Transportation Bldg, 104 S Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, United States of America, udaybag@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Judith Cardell, Di Zhang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: As the proportion of wind power in the generation mix increases, existing market designs may prove inadequate. We consider the impacts of reliability on increased wind penetration through the use  multiperiod energy and capacity market models. Specifically, uncertainty in wind velocities is captured through stochastic equilibrium formulations.  Some preliminary computational results will also be provided.
