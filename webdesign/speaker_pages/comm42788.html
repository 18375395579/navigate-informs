Title: Multi-objective Routing in Congested Transportation Networks<br>Author: James MacGregor Smith, Professor, Univ. of Massachusettes-Amherst, Dept. Mech. and Ind. Engineering, 160 Governor's Dr., Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, jmsmith@ecs.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Stepanov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present an approach for designing optimal routing policies for emergency evacuation planning. The approach finds a solution which minimizes clearance time, total travelled distance and congestion along egress routes and also accounts for potential road link failures due to incidents.  The core of the approach is an integer program (IP) model, which uses a state-dependent service rate queueing model to evaluate the time delays on road links. Numerous computational experiments are provided.
