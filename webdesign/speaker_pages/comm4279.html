Title: Bandit Problems with Side Information<br>Author: Assaf Zeevi, Associate Professor, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, assaf@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a two armed bandit problem that serves as a canonical model of sequential decision making under uncertainty, and as such exhibits a clear  trade off between estimation and optimization. We show that if one endows the decision maker with suitable ``side information,''  then the optimal strategy and associated  performance can be  strikingly different than those seen in  the classical setting where no side information is available.
