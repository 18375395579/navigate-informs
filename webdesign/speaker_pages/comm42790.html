Title: A Cutting-Plane Method for Two Facility Reliability Problems<br>Author: Mike Prince, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, mikeprince4@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We analyze two three-stage problems in which an operator makes system fortification decisions in the first stage and in the second stage, disruptions occur. In the third stage, the operator assigns demand nodes to facilities with a goal of either minimizing the total weighted demand or minimizing the maximum distance between any demand and its assigned facility.  We develop various formulations for these models and develop a cutting-plane method for their solution.
