Title: Queues with Collaborative Flexible Servers<br>Author: Hayriye Ayhan, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of ISyE, 326 Groseclose Building, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, hayhan@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir, Douglas Down<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Consider a tandem queueing network with two stations, two flexible servers, infinite supply of jobs in front of station 1, infinite room for completed jobs after station 2, and finite buffer between the stations. We assume that the servers can work together, but they become less efficient when they collaborate. Our objective is to determine how the optimal dynamic server assignment policy depends on how well the servers work together.
