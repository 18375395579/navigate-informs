Title: Optimizing Patient Movement Within a Hospital<br>Author: Jonathan Patrick, Assistant Professor, University of Ottawa, 163 Fifth Ave,, Ottawa, ON, K1S2M8, Canada, jonathan.patrick@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Puterman<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Capacity planning within hospitals remains largely a matter of reaction and budgetary limitations.  We seek to help hospital administrators balance the cost of base capacity against overtime.  Recognizing that capacity requirements depend on patient scheduling and placement policies, we build a model that determines the optimal patient scheduling and placement as well as the resource capacity required to meet pre-specified service targets (usually in the forms of wait time targets).
