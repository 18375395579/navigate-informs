Title: Filtered Likelihood for Point Processes<br>Author: Gustavo Schwenkler, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, United States of America, gschwenk@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kay Giesecke<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop likelihood estimators of the parameters of a point process and of incompletely observed explanatory factors that influence the arrival intensity. The factors follow general stochastic processes and may depend on the point process. We provide conditions guaranteeing consistency and asymptotic normality as the sample period grows. We also establish an approximation to the likelihood and analyze the properties of the associated estimators. Numerical results illustrate our approach.
