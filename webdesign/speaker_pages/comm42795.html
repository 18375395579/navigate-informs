Title: Cross-training Policies for Parallel Service Operations with Supply Uncertainty<br>Author: Fred Easton, Professor, Syracuse University, Whitman School of Management, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, 13244, United States, ffeaston@syr.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Although cross-training investments enhance the ability of service delivery systems to respond to demand uncertainty, employee absences may compromise those gains.  We study the effects of absenteeism on the performance of chained cross-training policies in multi-task service delivery systems staffed with heterogeneous employees working overlapping shifts.
