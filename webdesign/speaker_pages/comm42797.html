We present a multilevel  scheme to resolve the tradeoff between the bias and the variance of the estimator. It shows that the complexity of our method is O(\epsilon^{-2} (log\epsilon)^2) in the cases of Lipschitz risk measures and O(\epsilon^{-7/3}) in the cases of loss probabilities and other non-smooth risk measures, if we require the target MSE to be less than \epsilon^2.</br>
