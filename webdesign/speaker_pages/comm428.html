Box 44, Tonawanda, NY, 14151-0044, United States of America, Julien_Granger@praxair.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We characterize exactly a synchronization station fed by three independent Poisson processes with shut-down levels via a Markov renewal approach. We compare this system with an alternative system comprising two synchronization stations, each with two buffers, organized in a cascading fashion. We show that those two systems are not equivalent. We provide guidelines for arranging the three input processes so that the cascading system represents most accurately the original system.</br>
