Specifically, we hypothesize that the demand of every retail product has two components--intrinsic and impulse.  Products with a dominant impulse demand component tend to be strongly influenced by their locations in the store.  We propose some heuristics to solve the NP-hard placement optimization problem and consider the design of an in-store experiment to effectively tease out the placement effect.</br>
