<br>Title: Reliable Real-time Travel Time Prediction with Sparsely Distributed Detectors`</br><br>Author: Nan Zou, Research Associate, University of Maryland, 9716 Luguna Road, Middle River, MD, 21220, United States, nanzou@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jianwei Wang, Gang-Len Chang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study aims to develop a reliable and cost-effective travel time prediction system that needs only a small number of traffic detectors and does not rely on the concurrent measurement of travel times to perform accurate real-time travel time predictions under recurrent traffic conditions and some scenarios with missing data.</br>
