Title: Optimal Security Inspection with a Single-Server Queue<br>Author: Michael Zabarankin, Assistant Professor, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, mzabaran@stevens.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: An optimization problem for security inspection with a single-server queue subject to a constraint on the average time spent in a system has been formulated and solved for the M/G/1 queue for two specific performance functionals for exponential, shifted-exponential and triangular inspection-time distributions. A version of the Pollaczek-Khinchin formula for the steady-state waiting-time distribution for the M/G/1 queue has been derived in the framework of Riemann boundary-value problems.
