Title: Improving Utilization and Outcomes of High Kidney Donor Profile Index Kidney Transplants<br>Author: Ashley Davis, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Room C210, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, AshleyDavis2012@u.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sanjay Mehrotra, Daniela Ladner, John Friedewald, Anton Skaro, Jane Holl, Michael Abecassis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: High Kidney Donor Profile Index kidneys (hKDPI) are most frequently discarded because of allocation system inefficiencies.  We analyze current hKDPI kidney allocation and model three alternative allocation systems to compare each system’s expected allocation efficiency by mean kidney travel distance.  We find that optimized directed Donor Service Area allocation reduces kidney travel distance by 42%.  This reduction may potentially reduce hKDPI kidney wastage in a time of great organ shortage.
