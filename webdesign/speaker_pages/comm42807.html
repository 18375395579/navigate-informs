Title: Load Balancing in Parallel Systems with Highly Variable Service Times<br>Author: Mark Lewis, Associate Professor, School of Operations Research and Information Engineering, Cornell University, 226 Rhode Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, mark.lewis@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Kaufman, Luz Caudillo-Fuentes<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider two parallel queues with customers that arrive to each according to Poisson processes. After each arrival or service, a decision-maker can decide to re-balance the system by moving customers between queues. The issue is that the service times are highly variable or follow a heavy-tailed distribution. Heuristics based on a Markov decision process formulation are developed.
