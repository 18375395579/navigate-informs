Stern School of Business, New York University, 44 West 4th Street, 8-72, New York, NY, 10012, United States, vgaur@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sridhar Seshadri, Marti Subrahmanyam<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a single-period inventory model when forecasts of demand and price improve with time. We provide conditions under which postponement is optimal and those for which early exercise takes place. We also determine the impact of risk-premium and volatilities of price-demand on the optimal timing and stocking decisions.
