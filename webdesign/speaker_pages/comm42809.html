<br>Title: Fully Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials: Simultaneous Learning from Multiple Patients</br><br>Author: Vishal Ahuja, PhD Candidate, University of Chicago, Booth Business School, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, vahuja@chicagobooth.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Birge</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Traditional clinical trials are randomized and the goal is to maximize learning about treatment. Adaptive designs, on the other hand, allow clinicians to learn about treatment effectiveness during the course of the trial. In an adaptive design, allocation of patients to treatments evolves dynamically as the trial progresses. An ideal adaptive design maximizes patient health outcomes without sacrificing any potential learning. We propose such a design, one that fully exploits learning from multiple patients simultaneously. We demonstrate our design's effectiveness on a recent trial. Our design is general and applicable to any Markov decision process setting where learning takes place.</br>
