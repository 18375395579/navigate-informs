Title: Hub Location under Uncertainty<br>Author: Stefan Nickel, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, P.O.

Two sources of uncertainty are considered: the set-up costs for the hubs and the demands to be transported between the nodes.  Firstly, the two sources of uncertainty are analyzed separately and afterwards a more comprehensive model is proposed considering all sources of uncertainty. Computational tests show the changes in the solutions driven by the different sources of uncertainty considered.
