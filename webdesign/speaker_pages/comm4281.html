Box 3640, Karlsruhe, 76021, Germany, stefan.nickel@kit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sibel Alumur, Francisco Saldanha-da-Gama</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we address several aspects concerning hub location problems under uncertainty. Two sources of uncertainty are considered: the set-up costs for the hubs and the demands to be transported between the nodes.  Firstly, the two sources of uncertainty are analyzed separately and afterwards a more comprehensive model is proposed considering all sources of uncertainty. Computational tests show the changes in the solutions driven by the different sources of uncertainty considered.</br>
