Most of the previous models use a grid representation that considers only the eight closest neighbor cells to define feasible road links. We present an improved search space and alignment constraints representation mapped on a mathematical graph for better forest road network design. Our model provides enhanced vertical and horizontal road alignments - especially in steep terrain - and reduces the construction cost by 20% to 70%.</br>
