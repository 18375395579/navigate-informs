<br>Title: Optimal Timing of the “Adoption with Research?Period for Conditional Reimbursement of Drugs</br><br>Author: Leyla Mohseninejad, University Medical Center Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, Gr, 9713 GZ, Netherlands, leymohnezh@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Talitha Feenstra, Kuno Huisman, Maarten Postma, Cornelis Boersma, Erik Buskens</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In the Dutch healthcare system, new inpatient drugs are conditionally reimbursed while additional research is undertaken to support a final decision. We present a framework to find the suitable time point for making a definite decision on a conditionally reimbursed drug. We consider the costs and benefits of extending the research period. Deriving the expected value of the additional information, and trading it off against the costs of delay, the expected net gains can be found and optimized.</br>
