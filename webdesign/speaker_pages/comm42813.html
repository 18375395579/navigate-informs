While Cloud computing allows practically infinite scaling of capacity based on demand, such “on-demand?capacity is relatively expensive.  Instead, IT organizations may choose to reserve some capacity for some portion of their demand and then resort to “on-demand?capacity only for unsatisfied demand.  In this paper, we define the optimal capacity reservation policy that minimizes cost subject to demand variability.
