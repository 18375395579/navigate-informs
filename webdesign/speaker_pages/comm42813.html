<br>Title: Capacity Reservation Policies in Cloud Computing Marketplaces</br><br>Author: Aaron Yan, Gravitant, Inc., 11940 Jollyville Rd. Suite 325-N, Austin, TX, 78759, United States of America, aaron.yan@gravitant.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ilyas Iyoob, Ton Dieker</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many IT organizations now choose to go to the Cloud for their computing needs.  While Cloud computing allows practically infinite scaling of capacity based on demand, such “on-demand?capacity is relatively expensive.  Instead, IT organizations may choose to reserve some capacity for some portion of their demand and then resort to “on-demand?capacity only for unsatisfied demand.  In this paper, we define the optimal capacity reservation policy that minimizes cost subject to demand variability.</br>
