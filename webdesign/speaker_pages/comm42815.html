Title: Proportional Response Dynamics Leads to Market Equilibrium<br>Author: Li Zhang, HP Labs, 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA, United States, l.zhang@hp.com<br>Coauthor(s): Fang Wu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We model the bandwidth allocation in a peer to peer file sharing system as an exchange economy and study the proportional response dynamics in this economy.  In a proportional response dynamics each player distributes its good to its neighbors proportional to the utility it received from them in the last period. We show that this dynamics not only converges but converges to a market equilibrium, a standard economic characterization of efficient exchanges in a competitive market.
