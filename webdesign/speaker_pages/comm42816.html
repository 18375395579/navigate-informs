<br>Title: The Multi-story Space Assignment Problem</br><br>Author: Peter Hahn, Adjunct Associate Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 2127 Tryon Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19146, United States of America, hahn@seas.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Rong Zhu, James MacGregor Smith</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Multi-story Space Assignment Problem (MSAP) models the location of departments of unequal size within multi-story facilities as a Generalized Quadratic 3-dimensional Assignment Problem (GQ3AP). Not only can the MSAP generate the design of the location of the departments in the facility, it also includes the evacuation planning for the facility. The formulation, background mathematical development, and computational experience with a branch and bound algorithm for the MSAP are also presented.</br>
