Title: Upper Bound on the Inefficiency of Condorcet Solution Using Weber Optimal Value as Benchmark<br>Author: Rongbing Huang, York University, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, Canada, rhuang@yorku.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mozart Menezes<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper focuses on the worst-case quality of the Condorcet solution measured through the upper bound of the ratio of the Weber objective function value at the Condorcet solution to the Weber optimal objective function value. Prior work defined on networks showed the ratio to be 3. We show that on plane the ratio is smaller than 1.414. The result suggests that, when reducing the impact of topology, the solution originated via voting, it is much closer to optimality than previously suggested.
