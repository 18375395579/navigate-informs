<br>Title: On Deploying Vehicles for Public Electrical Scooter Sharing Systems</br><br>Author: I-Lin Wang, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 70101, Taiwan - ROC, ilinwang@mail.ncku.edu.tw</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In places of hot or rainy weather that is not biking friendly,  electrical scooters may be better vehicles than bikes for a vehicle  sharing system. This paper investigates how to deploy electrical  scooters in each rental sites, given the estimated origin-destination  demands and rates of battery consumption and charging. A mixed integer  programming model will be proposed to calculate the optimal fleet  deployment, as well as some interesting findings based on our  preliminary computational experiments.</br>
