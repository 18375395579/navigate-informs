<br>Title: Lexicographical Minimization of Routing Hops in Hop-constrained Node Survivable Networks</br><br>Author: Luis Eduardo Neves Gouveia, CIO and DEIO, Cidade Universitária, Bloco C6, Campo Grande, Lisbon, 1749-016, Portugal, legouveia@fc.ul.pt</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pedro Patricio, Amaro de Sousa</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We address the following traffic engineering problem: how to route deterministic changes of original demands in a pre-dimensioned network, maintaining network survivability and QoS, while minimizing the number of hops of either i) all service paths or ii) the worst service path for each commodity, in a lexicographical sense. We present and discuss two classes of Integer Linear Programming models for this problem and computational results considering several traffic demand settings.</br>
