Title: Scheduling Capacitated Re-entrant LInes through Approximate Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Spyros Reveliotis, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, ISyE, 765 Ferst Dr., Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, spyros.reveliotis@isye.gatech.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of throughput maximization of re-entrant lines with finite buffering capacity at the line workstations. The presence of finite buffers gives rise to blocking effects that negate well known results concerning the throughput-optimal scheduling of re-entrant lines with infinite buffering capacity. We will present an approximate policy iteration scheme for the resulting scheduling problem that is based on a feature-based aggregation of the underlying state space.
