Title: Effect of Load Transfers on Carrier Collaboration: A Network Design Formulation<br>Author: Salvador Hernandez, Research Assistant, Purdue University, School of Civil Engineering, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, shhernan@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A single carrier (small to medium) seeks to collaborate with other carriers to ship demand it cannot fully serve. The goal of the carrier is to identify the routes that minimize the sum of the collaborative path costs which include transfer costs. A mixed integer formulation is presented, issues are identified, and solution directions are discussed.
