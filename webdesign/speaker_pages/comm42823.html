<br>Title: Approximation Bounds on Information Loss for Disclosure Limitation Methods.</br><br>Author: Sumitra Mukherjee, Professor, Nova Southeastern University, Graduate School of Computer & Information Sciences, 3301 College Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33314-9918, United States, sumitra@nova.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Disclosure limitation methods modify data released to users to protect the confidentiality of data subjects. Since data modification reduces the utility of released data, the objective is to minimize information loss while ensuring that the risk of disclosure is below an acceptable threshold. This paper demonstrates how guaranteed bounds on information loss may be obtained for existing disclosure limitation methods.</br>
