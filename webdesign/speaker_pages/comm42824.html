<br>Title: Robust Queueing Theory</br><br>Author: Chaithanya Bandi, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, cbandi@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nataly Youssef, Dimitris Bertsimas</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study queueing systems by employing robust optimization as opposed to stochastic analysis. We set the limiting laws of probability as the axioms of our approach and model queue primitives by uncertainty sets. We analyze single-class multi-server queueing networks and obtain closed form expressions for the waiting times with heavy-tailed arrival and service processes. Our approach yields accurate results compared to simulations and is fairly insensitive to network size and traffic intensity.</br>
