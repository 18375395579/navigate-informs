Title: The Evolution of the World’s Airline Network<br>Author: Kemp Harker, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, kemp.d.harker@boeing.com<br>Coauthor(s): Roger A Parker<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Using some of the measures discussed in the previous presentation, the evolution of the world’s airline network over the last 25 years is analyzed.  The rates of recovery from system shock (e. g. SARS outbreak or terrorist attack) are characterized with time series methods.  The emergence of hub and spoke network structure is portrayed, leading to the proliferation of point-to-point service.  The demand structures and network response underlying the network’s evolutionary pattern are examined.
