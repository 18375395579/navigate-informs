Title: Lot-Sizing with Minimum Order Quantity<br>Author: Diego Klabjan, Associate Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1206 West Green Street, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, klabjan@mit.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the deterministic lot-sizing problem under the assumption that in each time period either no order is placed or at least a certain given amount is ordered. We present two polynomially solvable cases and we develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme.
