Two criteria are compared: a marginal pricing scheme, in which the cost of each circuit is allocated to the scenario that led to the maximum use of that circuit; and a tolling scheme, in which the cumulative distribution of circuit usage is taken into account. The methodology will be illustrated for the 5,000 bus Brazilian transmission network.</br>
