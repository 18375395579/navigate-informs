Title: Stochastic Control Representation for Penalty Method of Optimal Stopping Problems<br>Author: Gechun Liang, King's College London, Department of Mathematics, Strand, London, WC2R 2LS, United Kingdom, gechun.liang@oxford-man.ox.ac.uk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We show that both reflected backward stochastic differential equation and its associated penalized equation admit both optimal stopping representation and optimal control representation. We also show that both multidimensional reflected BSDE and its associated penalized BSDE admit optimal switching representation. The corresponding optimal stopping (switching) problems for penalized BSDE have the feature that only stopping at exogenous Poisson arrival times is allowed.
