Title: Simultaneous Berth and Quay Crane Scheduling for Container Ports<br>Author: Alan Erera, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, alan.erera@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Aykagan Ak<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This study concentrates on simultaneously scheduling the most critical resources in a container terminal, berths and quay cranes, since the duration of a vessel occupying a berth directly depends on the number of cranes allocated to the vessel. Using heuristic methods, we attempt to determine berthing positions and berthing times of vessels as well as the assignment of quay cranes to bays of the vessels to minimize total required service time.
