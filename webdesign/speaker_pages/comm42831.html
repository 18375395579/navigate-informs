We examine the situation in which the information observed by each node is insufficient for the node to solve the problem independently. Diffusion adaptation strategies are employed to allow the incomplete information at each node to flow across the entire network through local interactions and in-network processing. We analyze the performance and convergence of the distributed solution.</br>
