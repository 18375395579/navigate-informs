Title: Charging Electric Vehicles under Capacity and Pricing Constraints<br>Author: Pavan Murali, Research Scientist, IBM Research, 19 Skyline Dr, 4S-G54, Hawthorne, NY, 10532, United States of America, pmurali@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ajay Deshpande, Bruno Flach<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a 2-stage stochastic program to address the problem of scheduling EV charging in commercial locations (malls, offices etc) when the price of charging, p, ($/kWh) depends on dwelling duration. We present methods to determine p and schedules (recourse action) when price of electricity is either fixed or is sensitive to the time-of-day, while maximizing demand met.
