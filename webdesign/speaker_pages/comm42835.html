<br>Title: The Effect of Variability in Climate Policy on Facility Location and International Trade</br><br>Author: Ozge Islegen, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, o-islegen@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Terry Taylor, Erica Plambeck</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: One region imposes either a tax on GHG emissions or a cap-and-trade system in which the cost of a permit for emissions is uncertain and has mean equal to the tax.  We show how variability in the permit cost affects the “leakage?of emissions, trade quantities, and social welfare in the region with climate policy under border adjustment and technology investment options.</br>
