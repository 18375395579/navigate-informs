<br>Title: New Facets for the K-median Problem</br><br>Author: Wenhui Zhao, Research Fellow, Washington University at St. Louis, John M. Olin School of Business, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States of America, zhao@olin.wustl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc E. Posner</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The polyhedral structure of the K-median problem is examined.  We establish two basic properties of facets. Then, we apply these properties to generalize three existing classes of facets. Also, we  establish that a class of k-cover inequalities are facet inducing.</br>
