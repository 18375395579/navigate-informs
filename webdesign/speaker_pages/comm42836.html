Title: New Facets for the K-median Problem<br>Author: Wenhui Zhao, Research Fellow, Washington University at St. Louis, John M. Olin School of Business, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States of America, zhao@olin.wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marc E. Posner<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The polyhedral structure of the K-median problem is examined.  We establish two basic properties of facets. Then, we apply these properties to generalize three existing classes of facets. Also, we  establish that a class of k-cover inequalities are facet inducing.
