Title: Order Processing and Production Planning in the Presence of Pseudo-orders<br>Author: Long Gao, Smeal College of Business, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, gaolong@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Susan Xu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop a MDP model for dynamic order processing and production planning in an Available-To-Promise environment with highly lumpy and volatile pseudo-orders. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and investigate the impact of system parameters. We further compare the performances of several widely used policies with that of the optimal policy under different scenarios, and provide several recommendations for the management.
