Title: Selecting the Best System When Systems Are Revealed Sequentially<br>Author: Barry Nelson, Professor, Northwestern University, Department of IEMS, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States, nelsonb@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): L. Jeff Hong<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Statistical ranking and selection (R&S) is a collection of experiment design and analysis techniques for selecting the system with the largest or smallest mean performance. The existing procedures all assume that the set of alternatives is available at the beginning of the experiment. In many situations, however, the alternatives are revealed sequentially during the experiment. We introduce new procedures that are capable of selecting the best alternative in these situations.
