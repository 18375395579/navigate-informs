<br>Title: Construction of Routes on Harvest Areas for Harvesters and Forwarders using Detailed GIS Information</br><br>Author: Mikael Ronnqvist, Universit?Laval, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pavillon Adrien Pouliot, Québec, QU, G1K 7P4, Canada, mikael.ronnqvist@gmc.ulaval.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sima Mohtashami, Patrik Flisberg, P. Jönsson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Today detailed information on harvest areas including tree locations, terrain condition, altitude and soil conditions can be used to optimize the trail outlay for harvesters and forwarders. We propose a solution method to construct both primary and secondary trails for both machine types. We present results from case studies in Sweden.</br>
