Jönsson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Today detailed information on harvest areas including tree locations, terrain condition, altitude and soil conditions can be used to optimize the trail outlay for harvesters and forwarders. We propose a solution method to construct both primary and secondary trails for both machine types. We present results from case studies in Sweden.
