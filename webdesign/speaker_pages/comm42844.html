<br>Title: Robust Project Scheduling at a Large IT Services Delivery Organization</br><br>Author: Elvin Coban, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, ecoban@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aliza R. Heching, J.N. Hooker, Alan Scheller-Wolf</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a project scheduling problem at a large IT services delivery organization (SDO) with cross-trained employees, heterogeneous projects, schedule disruptions, and service quality guarantees. Durations of subtasks and disruptions and project arrival times are uncertain. System parameters are estimated using data from the IT SDO.  Our goal is to identify an effective scheduling of project subtasks and assignment to each employee, capturing uncertainties in a robust scheduling model.</br>
