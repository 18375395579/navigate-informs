<br>Title: A Potential Game Framework for Approximately Optimal Pricing in Heterogeneous Networks</br><br>Author: Michael Padilla, Assistant Professor, Singapore University of Technology and Design, 20 Dover Drive, Singapore, 138682, Singapore, michael_padilla@sutd.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tony Quek, Liang Ze Wong</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the distributed allocation of resources in a heterogeneous network and introduce a dynamic pricing scheme which converts our game into a potential game whose potential function is the social welfare. This dynamic pricing scheme is approximated with a mechanism that assigns a fixed price to each resource, and learning algorithms are presented which allow agents to select resources. Computational studies show that the social welfare approaches 85% of a centrally computed optimum.</br>
