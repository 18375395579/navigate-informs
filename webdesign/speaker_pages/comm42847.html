Title: Oblivious Network Design<br>Author: Anupam Gupta, Professor, Carnegie-Mellon University, Computer Science Department, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, anupamg@cs.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a network design problem in which the cost of the flow routed between sources and sinks is a concave cost function; the goal is to minimize the  total cost incurred. The routing has to be oblivious: when a terminal pair makes its routing decisions, it does not know the current flow on the network nor the identity of the other pairs in the system. We develop a framework to model oblivious network design problems and give algorithms with poly-logarithmic competitive ratio.
