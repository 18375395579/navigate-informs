Title: Balanced Billing Cycles and Vehicle Routing of Meter Readers<br>Author: Chris Groer, University of Maryland, AMSC Program, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, cgroer@comcast.net<br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Golden, Edward Wasil<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Utility companies send their fleets of meter readers out on each day of the billing cycle to determine each customer’s usage.  Over time, customers are removed and others are added to the existing routes.  A utility company must, therefore, adjust its meter-reading routes.  We discuss this problem in this paper.
