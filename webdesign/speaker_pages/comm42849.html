Comparing units non-randomly exposed to treatment against those unexposed, the paper motivates algorithms that work to minimize the mutual information (MI) between the covariate vectors of compared units and the treatment variable. This approach is model-free, flexible and accurate. Optimality conditions are derived by treating non-linearity in the MI function. Computational results are reported.</br>
