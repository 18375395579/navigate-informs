Title: Lead-Time Information and The Role of Expediting in Managing Supply Systems with Uncertain Lead-Time<br>Author: Sammi Tang, PhD Student, Washington University in St. Louis, Olin School of Business, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States, tangy@wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study how the lead time information and the existence of an expediting service can help improve inventory management in supply systems with stochastic lead-times.  A retailer places a regular order from a supplier.  After the order is released, it is possible to expedite part or all of the original order when it passes through some intermediate point so that the expedited product will be delivered in a shorter time.
