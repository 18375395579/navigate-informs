The productivities of employees are modeled as increasing nonlinear functions of wages. Numerical experiments reveal that cross training is valuable and a higher variation of productivity functions result in lower costs. The goodness of the solution and required time are sensitive to the size, and the degree of nonlinearity of the system.
