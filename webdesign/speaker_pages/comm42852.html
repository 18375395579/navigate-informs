Title: On Information Distortion in Online Ratings<br>Author: Omar Besbes, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, ob2105@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marco Scarsini<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We analyze the interplay between past and future ratings due to the sequential nature of reports. We show that, for a broad class of behavioral models, and mixture thereof, the long-run average of sequentially declared ratings, when well defined, preserves stochastic order of the true rating. In addition, we show that there exist behaviors that allow manipulations of the long-run average of sequentially declared ratings through a finite number of fake reviews.
