We show that, for a broad class of behavioral models, and mixture thereof, the long-run average of sequentially declared ratings, when well defined, preserves stochastic order of the true rating. In addition, we show that there exist behaviors that allow manipulations of the long-run average of sequentially declared ratings through a finite number of fake reviews.</br>
