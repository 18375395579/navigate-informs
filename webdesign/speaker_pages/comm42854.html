<br>Title: Supporting Navy Forward Stock Positioning Using an Optimization Heuristic Approach</br><br>Author: Norman Reitter, Director, Operations Research, CTC, 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA, 15904, United States, reittern@ctc.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Walt DeGrange</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The Navy Operational Logistics Support Center coordinates multi-modal shipment policies that directly impact readiness of deployed Naval forces.  In this paper, we show a method for the NOLSC to determine the best mix of products to forward position in Combatant Commander Areas of Responsibility.  This presentation will introduce the audience to the Navy's forward stocking problem, a multi-objective solution technique, and initial results.</br>
