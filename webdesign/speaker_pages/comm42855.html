Title: Locating Multiple Facilities in a Competitive Environment<br>Author: Zvi Drezner, Professor, California State University, Fullerton, CA, 92834, United States, zdrezner@fullerton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Atsuo Suzuki, Tammy Drezner<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate the location of one or more facilities anywhere in an area in which several competing facilities already exist. The attractiveness of each facility is modeled by a utility function. Each customer selects the facility with the greatest utility function value. As a case study we find the best locations of new convenience stores in the city of Seto, Japan.
