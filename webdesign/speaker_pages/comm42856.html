Title: The Changing Structure of the Air Carrier Network and Its Impact on System Performance<br>Author: Michael Wells, Economist, FAA / ATO, Portals Building, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington DC, DC, 20591, United States, michael.wells@faa.gov<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This presentation examines how the route system used by passenger air carriers has changed since the year 2000, and what impact it has had on travel times, delays, and cancellations.  Total flights in U.S. airspace are down from their levels in 2000, yet total system-wide delay is back to its level in 2000.  This paper looks at how changes in the overall distribution of traffic have helped to bring this about.
