Title: Scheduling Dual-Gripper Robotic Cells: Optimization over 1-Unit Cycles<br>Author: Kyung Sung Jung, University of Texas-Dallas, Dallas, TX, United States of America, kxj083000@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Neil Geismar, Michael Pinedo, Chelliah Sriskandarajah<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a cyclic sequence of robot moves that maximizes the throughput in dual-gripper bufferless robotic cells. The cell is designed to produce identical parts under the free-pickup criterion and the additive-travel-time metric in a circular layout. Obtaining an optimum 1-unit cyclic solution is the focus of this paper. We establish conditions where the problem of finding an optimal cycle is NP-hard. The remaining cases can be shown to be polynomial solvable.
