Title: Life Cycle Cost and GHG Emissions of Electric Vehicle Fast Charging and Battery Swapping Stations<br>Author: Jeremy Michalek, Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, jmichalek@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chris Hendrickson, Elizabeth Traut<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine scenarios for fast charging and battery swapping for battery electric vehicles at service stations along a highway. We construct infrastructure life cycle cost and greenhouse gas emissions models, including operation (queuing) models for equipment and battery inventory requirements. We find that direct costs of fast charging are lower, but including the value of waiting time during service makes battery swapping less costly provided that vehicles and batteries are standardized.
