Title: Dynamic Customer Acquisition and Retention Management<br>Author: Greg King, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, Department of Industrial and Operations, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, gjking@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiuli Chao, Izak Duenyas<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In consulting, finance, and other service industries, customers represent a revenue stream, and must be acquired and retained over time. In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem of a profit maximizing service firm that dynamically allocates its resources towards acquiring new clients and retaining unsatisfied existing ones. We formulate the problem as a dynamic program and characterize the structure of the optimal acquisition and retention strategy.
