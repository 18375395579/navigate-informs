Title: An Optimization Approach to Airline Integrated Recovery<br>Author: Jon Petersen, Georgia Tech, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, Petersen@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ellis Johnson, Gustaf Solveling, Yan Shu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the presence of irregular operations airlines need to restore their schedule, aircraft routings, crew pairings, and passenger itineraries in a timely manner. The current practice of recovery relies on a sequential optimization framework. We present a decomposition scheme that uses flight strings to restore the schedule while assigning individual aircraft, crew, and itineraries in one integrated optimization model. The model yields a passenger-friendly solution with crew considerations.
