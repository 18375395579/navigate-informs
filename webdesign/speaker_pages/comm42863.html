<br>Title: Multi-item Lot-sizing with Joint Set-up Cost</br><br>Author: Shoshana Anily, Professor, Tel Aviv University, Faculty of Management, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel, anily@post.tau.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laurence Wolsey, Michal Tzur</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consider a multi-item lot-sizing problem with joint set-up costs and constant capacities. Apart from items unit production and storage costs, a set-up cost is incurred per batch, where a batch may include any mix of items. Under widely applicable conditions, namely that the production and storage costs are non-speculative, and the order of the item holding cost is identical in all periods, we present a tight linear program that solves the problem, proving that it is polynomially solvable.</br>
