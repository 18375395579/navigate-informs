<br>Title: The Sonnevend Curvature and the Klee-walkup Result</br><br>Author: Murat Mut, Doctorate Student, Lehigh University, 200 W. Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, mhm309@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tamás Terlaky</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider Sonnevend's (1991) curvature for the central path (CP) of LO problems. Our main result is that to get an upper bound for the total Sonnevend curvature of CP, it is enough to consider the case n=2m. This also implies that worst cases for path-following IPMs occur too when n=2m, and also yields an asymptotic O(n) lower bound for Sonnevend’s curvature. We were motivated by the work of Deza et al. (2008), who gave analogous results of the Klee-Walkup result for the geometric curvature.</br>
