Title: To Find the Distribution of the Number of Renewals of a Renewal Process Using Laplace Transforms<br>Author: Boon Ong, Dr, Royal Military College, P.O. Box 1700 Stn Forces, Kingston, ON, K7K 7B4, Canada, ong-b@rmc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mohan Chaudhry<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The distribution of the number of renewals of a renewal process over a time period 0 to t is found by inverting a Laplace transform using the roots method. Where a distribution has no Laplace transform, continued fractions are used to approximate the Laplace transform.
