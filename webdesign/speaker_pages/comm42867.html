Title: A Multi-Product Network Design Model with Lead Time and Safety Stock Considerations<br>Author: Karthik Sourirajan, Research Staff Member, IBM TJ Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, ksourira@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Reha Uzsoy, Leyla Ozsen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study a multi-product network design problem in which we explicitly model the non-linear relationships between demand assigned to a DC,  replenishment lead times and safety stocks. While lead time congestion can  be thought of as a global network property that depends on the total  demand flows, safety stock risk-pooling can be thought of as a local  network property that depends on individual products' demand flows. Our  model captures the trade-off between these properties.
