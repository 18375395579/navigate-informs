Title: Convergence of Sequential Sampling Policies for Bayesian Information Collection Problems<br>Author: Peter Frazier, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, pfrazier@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider adaptive sequential sampling policies in a general Bayesian framework.  We present new sufficient conditions for convergence, or asymptotic optimality, in this sequential setting, and apply these conditions to show asymptotic optimality of several existing policies for ranking and selection.
