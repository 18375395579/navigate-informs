Title: Robust Shape Fitting via Peeling and Grating Coresets<br>Author: Pankaj Agarwal, Duke University, Department of Computer Science, Levine Science Research Center D315, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, pankaj@cs.duke.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Let P be a set of n points in d-dimensional Euclidean space. A (k,eps)-kernel is a subset of P that, for every direction, epsilon-approximates the directional width of P, when k outliers'' can be ignored in that direction. We prove that small (k,eps)-kernels exist and describe efficient algorithms for computing them. Such kernels are instrumental in solving shape-fitting problems with k outliers. This is joint work with Sariel Har-Peled and Hai Yu.
