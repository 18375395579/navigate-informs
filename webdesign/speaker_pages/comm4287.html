We study transportation networks that operate as an alliance. In particular, we study alliance formation among carriers in liner shipping. We utilize optimization and game theory concepts and design a mechanism to guide the carriers in an alliance to pursue an optimal collaborative strategy. The mechanism provides side payments to the carriers motivating them to act in the alliance best interest while maximizing their own profits.
