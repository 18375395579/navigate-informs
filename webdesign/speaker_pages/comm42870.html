Title: Modeling of and Numerical Solution to Optimal Control of Diabetes Mellitus Under Uncertainty<br>Author: Zhen Liu, Assistant Professor, University of Missouri - Rolla, 1870 Miner Circle, Rolla, MO, 65409, United States, zliu@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Birge<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the continuous control of insulin for diabetic patients  to minimize the cumulative deviations of blood glucose level from  basal level. The dynamics we use is the 'minimal model' of Bergman subject to uncertainties. A Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation  is derived and corresponding numerical methods are discussed.
