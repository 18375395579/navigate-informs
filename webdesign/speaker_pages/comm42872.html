<br>Title: Sequential Investment, Capacity Sizing, Dividing Flexibility</br><br>Author: Ryuta Takashima, Chiba Institute of Technology, Chiba, Japan, takashima@sun.it-chiba.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kimitoshi Sato, Yuta Naito</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of a typical investor who has discretion over not only the timing, but also the sizing of a new plant in sequential manner. We contrast the sequential investment strategies for different stage numbers in order to the value of flexibility. Additionally, we analyze the sequential investment for a case in which there exists a fixed cost in the investment one. The optimal stage numbers of sequential investment are obtained for various fixed coasts.</br>
