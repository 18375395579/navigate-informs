Title: Access Point Diversity for Efficient Packet Forwarding in Wireless LANs<br>Author: Ozgur Ercetin, Assistant Prof., Sabanci University, Electronics Engineering, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, 34956, Turkey, oercetin@sabanciuniv.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In 802.11 wireless networks, a user usually has the option of connecting to one of several available access points (APs). We argue that the user can obtain better quality of service by diversifying its traffic among APs. In this work, we consider the optimal packet splitting algorithms that would maximize the user throughput based on the channel loss characteristics, transmission rates and required resiliency to packet loss.
