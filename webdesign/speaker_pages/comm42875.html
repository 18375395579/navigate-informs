Title: Transportation Network Design for Tourism Development<br>Author: Yun Bai, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, United States of America, yunbai1@illinois.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study proposes an integrated bi-level optimization model to jointly address tourism planning (i.e., investment site choice) and network design of the supporting transportation infrastructure. The upper-level objective minimizes the total system cost while the lower-level captures user equilibrium for both tourists and non-tourists under traffic congestion. A customized solution approach is developed via reformulation and approximation, and then illustrated through an empirical case study.
