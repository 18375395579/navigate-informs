Title: Semidefinite Programming Approaches in Valuing Energy Derivatives<br>Author: Georgios Dalakouras, DalakouG@fhlbsf.com<br>Coauthor(s): Roy Kwon, Richard Ghazarian<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider SDP approachces for valuing path dependent energy derivatives. Several SDP formulations will be presented based on a technique for generating the moments of the risk-neutral distributions of energy (e.g. gas) prices.
