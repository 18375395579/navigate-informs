Title: Insensitivity of Effective Server Assignment Policies to Service Time Distributions<br>Author: H. Eser Kirkizlar, Georgia Tech, H. Milton Stewart School of ISyE, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, ekirkizl@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir, Hayriye Ayhan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a tandem line with infinite supply of jobs in front of the first station, infinite storage room after the last station, and finite buffers between the stations.  We study heuristic and optimal server assignment policies when the service time distributions are not necessarily exponential and the servers are cross-trained to work at different stations.
