Title: Deadhead Selection for Railway Crew Scheduling Applications<br>Author: Marc Albers, University of Cologne, Albertus-Magnus-Platz, Cologne, de, 50923, Germany, marc.albers@uni-koeln.de<br>Coauthor(s): Ulrich Thonemann<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Within the railway crew scheduling problem sparsity of connecting trains can lead to extended periods of inactivity. To avoid these inefficient times deadheads can reposition crews to other stations via different modes of transportation. We present an improved deadhead selection scheme that enables us to solve large-scale crew scheduling problems containing millions of potential deadheads.
