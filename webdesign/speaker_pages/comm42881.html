<br>Title: Extreme Tornados</br><br>Author: Paul Brooks, Associate Professor, Department of Statistical Sciences and Operations Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, PO Box 843083, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States of America, jpbrooks@vcu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Konig's Theorem states that in a bipartite graph, the covering number equals the matching number.  Ryser's conjecture asserts that for r-partite hypergraphs, the covering number is at most r-1 times the matching number.  The conjecture is open for intersecting hypergraphs.  An intersecting hypergraph with covering number r-1 must contain a structure called a tornado. Properties of extreme tornados, those with covering number r-1, are described.</br>
