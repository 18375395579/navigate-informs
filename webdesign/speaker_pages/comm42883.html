Title: Network Design for the Internet<br>Author: Thomas Magnanti, Professor, MIT, Operations Research Center Bldg E40-149, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, magnanti@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Fontana<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Many network design issues arise in the context of the Internet, ranging from basic protocol design through the design of routing networks for transmission propagation (such as multicasting) as well as the design of the basic underlying network infrastructures and the connections between them.   We will highlight some of these design issues and the approaches taken to address them.
