Title: Integrated Optimization of Procurement, Processing and Trade of Commodities in a Network Environment<br>Author: Sripad Devalkar, PhD Candidate, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48108, United States of America, devalkar@bus.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amitabh Sinha, Ravi Anupindi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider an integrated optimization problem for a firm involved in procurement, processing and trade of commodities in a network environment. We derive optimal policies for the firm when the processed commodity(ies) are sold using futures instruments. We also derive an upper bound on the value function using Lagrangian relaxation and quantify the performance of myopic policies.
