Title: Multivariate Extreme Value Thresholding<br>Author: Matthew Lacer, Graduate Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, ISYE, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, mvlacer@gatech.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Extreme Value Thresholding is the partitioning of data into regular and extreme valued for distribution fitting. In one dimension this entails setting a quantile cutoff for the Extreme Value Distribution; in higher dimension this involves fitting a Multivariate EVD to a k-dim quantile. We explore two approaches for the thresholding: multivariate Pickands (L-infinity) distance and multivariate Copula (f-divergence) distances and illustrate the methodology on multivariate environmental hazard data.
