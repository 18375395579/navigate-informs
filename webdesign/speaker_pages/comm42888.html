Title: One-bug-look-ahead Policies and Beyond<br>Author: Xiaoyue Jiang, Assistant Professor, Louisiana State University, Department of Construction Management, and Industrial Engineering, Baton Rouge, LA, 70803, United States, jiang@lsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Ray, Donglei Du<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The OLA policy for software releasing is re-examined in Nav Res Logist 54 (2007): 346?55. A counterexample is constructed to show that OLA is not optimal in general. The optimal stopping approach is then called upon to prove that OLA possesses a weaker sense of optimality under conditional monotonicity and the strong sense of optimality holds under a more restrictive sample-wise monotonicity condition. A further derivation of the optimal policy under conditional monotonicity is presented here.
