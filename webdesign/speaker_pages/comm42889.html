Title: Capacity Investment with Demand Forecast for a Finite-life-cycle Product<br>Author: Anyan Qi, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan St., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, anyqi@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amitabh Sinha, Hyun-Soo Ahn<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: For a new product with a finite life cycle, how should a firm invest in her capacity when the firm does not have complete information about the demand process? We develop a data-driven approach where the firm dynamically updates her belief about demand and makes capacity investment decision accordingly. We show the firm should follow a U/S/D (upgrading/staying the same/downgrading) policy in each period, and we evaluate performance of the approach relative to a simple hypothesis testing.
