<br>Title: Coding and Queueing Asymptotics in Large Networks</br><br>Author: Sanjay Shakkottai, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas of Austin, ECE Department, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, shakkott@ece.utexas.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Traditionally, network buffer resources have been used at routers to queue transient packets. In contrast, we propose a scheme where intermediate routers have no buffers for queueing transient packets. Instead, network storage (memory) is used only at source and destination nodes to encode/decode packets using random linear coding over time. In this paper, we show that coding at end hosts yields better performance (packet delay tail probability) in a large multi-hop network.</br>
