Title: Optimal Liver Acceptance Policies for Risk-sensitive Patients<br>Author: Atul Bhandari, Post-Doctoral Associate, University of Pittsburgh, 1178c Benedum Hall, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, abhandari79@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, Mark Roberts<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: For liver transplantation, patients join UNOSâ€™s waiting list. When a liver is offered, the patient decides between transplanting and waiting. We formulate the decision problem as a risk-sensitive finite-horizon MDP. We model risk preferences and maximize the total expected utility for any v.N-M utility function. We use age-dependent transition probabilities and rewards and establish structural properties. We extend the model to infinite-horizon for patients with exponential utility function.
