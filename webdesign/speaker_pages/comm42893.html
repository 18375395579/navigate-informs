<br>Title: Transportation Network Design Problem under the Boundedly Rational Route   Choice Behavioral Assumption</br><br>Author: Henry X. Liu, Associate Professor, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, henryliu@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuan Di</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many empirical studies have shown that drivers are boundedly rational in reality. Because the boundedly rational user equilibria (BRUE) are non-unique and the set containing all equilibria is not convex, the network design problem is quite challenging and has not yet been studied. By analyzing the structure of the BRUE set, we propose a methodology of the transportation network design within the boundedly rational route choice framework.</br>
