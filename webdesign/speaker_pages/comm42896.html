Title: Session-level Load Balancing for High-dimensional Systems<br>Author: Dennis Roubos, VU University Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1081a, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, Netherlands, droubos@few.vu.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Sandjai Bhulai<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Load balancing is critical for the performance of big server clusters. Recent advances in security and architecture design advocate load balancing on a session level. Due to the high dimensionality of this system, little attention has been paid to this new problem. We use Approximate Dynamic Programming to obtain approximate load balancing policies that are shown to have a nearly optimal performance through extensive numerical experiments.
