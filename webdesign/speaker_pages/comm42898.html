Title: A Single-server Queue with a Delayed Service Option and Abandonment<br>Author: Amy Ward, USC, Marshall School of Business, BRI 401 H, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-0804, United States, amyward@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sriram Dasu, Vasiliki Kostami<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a single-server queueing model in which customers may choose between waiting for service in real-time, and returning for service at a dynamically specified future time.  Some of the customers that promise to return for service do not return.  We show the system exhibits state-space collapse in the heavy-traffic limit, and develop a one-dimensional diffusion approximation with state-dependent drift.
