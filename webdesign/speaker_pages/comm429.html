Title: Value-Maximizing Fixed Targets<br>Author: Andrea Hupman, PhD Candidate, University of Illinois, 104 S Mathews Ave, 117 Transportation Bldg, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, hupman1@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ali Abbas<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of setting fixed targets in an organizational setting. We show how to set value-maximizing fixed targets and characterize the magnitude of the resulting value gap. We discuss the effects of risk aversion, division size, and the distribution of projects on the value gap and provide several insights on setting fixed targets within an organization.
