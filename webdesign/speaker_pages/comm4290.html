Title: Stochastic Risk-factor Model for Portfolio Optimization<br>Author: Miguel Lejeune, Assistant Professor, George Washington University, United States of America, mlejeune@gwu.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a stochastic risk-factor asset allocation model. We consider  the cases in which the asset returns have skewed probability distribution and/or investment constraints are imposed. We derive a solution method. Numerical results will illustrate its efficacy.
