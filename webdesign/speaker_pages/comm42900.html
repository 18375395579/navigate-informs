<br>Title: Equilibrium and Approximations for Repeated Auctions with Budgets Constraints</br><br>Author: Santiago Balseiro, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, srb2155@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Omar Besbes, Gabriel Weintraub</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Fluid Mean Field Equilibrium (FMFE) to study the dynamic bidding strategies of budget-constrained agents in repeated second-price auctions. This concept combines a mean field approximation to relax the agents?informational requirements, with a fluid approximation to handle the dynamics of the agents' control problems.  We show that a FMFE is computationally tractable, and that it approximates the rational behavior of agents in large markets.</br>
