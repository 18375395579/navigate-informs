Title: Optimal Replenishment Policies for Multi-product Stochastic Inventory Systems<br>Author: Vinayak Deshpande, Purdue University, 4024 Rawls Hall, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, vinayak@exchange.purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kumar Muthuraman, Haolin Feng<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We analyze optimal replenishment policies for multi-product inventory systems with joint-replenishment costs and correlated demand. Our focus is on computing and finding the structure of the optimal policies. An efficient method to compute the optimal policy that uses a moving boundary based policy improvement scheme is analyzed. A new heuristic, called an (s, c, d, S) policy is proposed, and is shown to closely approximate the optimal policy.
