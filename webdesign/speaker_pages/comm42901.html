Our focus is on computing and finding the structure of the optimal policies. An efficient method to compute the optimal policy that uses a moving boundary based policy improvement scheme is analyzed. A new heuristic, called an (s, c, d, S) policy is proposed, and is shown to closely approximate the optimal policy.</br>
