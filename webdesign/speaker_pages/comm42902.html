<br>Title: Allocation Problem Revisited</br><br>Author: Nesim Erkip, Bilkent University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, nesim@bilkent.edu.tr</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a multi-echelon distribution system with one warehouse and n-retailers. The allocation assumption as described by Eppen and Schrage (1981) is an approximation that has been widely used in subsequent studies. We propose a minimum-order-quantity policy for the ordering problem that will increase the probability that the allocation assumption is not be violated.</br>
