Title: Demand Clustering in Logistics Networks<br>Author: Rodrigo Mesa-Arango, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, rmesaara@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Clustering freight demand in logistics networks is important to determine groups of lanes that are attractive for a carrier given its current operations, costs, and the level of synergy between the lanes. This research proposes concepts to build such logistics networks and applies a network clustering algorithm to determine the sets of lanes that are more likely to be served together in order to maximize the expected profits of the carrier. Numerical experiments show the benefits of this approach.
