Title: Time Reversibility Analysis for the Erlang Abandonment Formula<br>Author: William Massey, Professor, Princeton University, ORFE Department, Princeton, NJ, United States, wmassey@Princeton.EDU<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Performance metrics for the steady state behavior of multi-server loss and delay queues were first characterized by Erlang through his B and C formulas. Call centers have focused on the extra feature of abandonment. The performance metric for such a model has been referred to as the Erlang-A formula. Using the methods of time-reversibility, we simplify the steady state analysis for deriving this formula and find some simple recursive algorithms to compute it.
