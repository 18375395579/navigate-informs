Title: Braess Paradox under Boundedly Rational Driving Behavior<br>Author: Henry Liu, University of Minnesota, 500 Pillsbury Dr SE, Civil Engineering, Minneapolis, MN, 55414, United States of America, henryliu@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuan Di<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Classical Braess' Paradox demonstrates that, provided drivers are perfectly rational in choosing routes, the overall network performance might be worsened after a new road is added. However, many empirical studies show that drivers are boundedly rational. We study the properties of Braess' Paradox when bounded rationality driver behavior takes place. This paper explores under which condition Braess' Paradox will occur, when the travel demand and rational bounds are varying.
