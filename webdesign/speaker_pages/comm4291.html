Lunquist College of Business, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, 97403-1208, United States, sxu@uoregon.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Bean</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study burn-in oven scheduling in semiconductor manufacturing with parallel, non-identical ovens and total weighted tardiness objective. Jobs have non-zero ready-time and variable processing times. We present a random keys genetic algorithm that finds good solutions in reasonable computation time.</br>
