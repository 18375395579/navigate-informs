<br>Title: Workforce Planning Under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Pano Santos, Senior Scientist, Hewlett Packard Labs, 1501 Page Mill Road, MS 1140, Palo ALto, CA, 94304, United States, cipriano.santos@hp.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dirk Beyer, Ernesto Brau, Qi Feng, Shailendra Jain</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Workforce planning under uncertainty is done based on a funnel of project opportunities. We compute the probability distribution of workforce demand at each period of the planning horizon, and determine an allocation of available workforce to opportunities. Gaps between workforce requirements and availability are fulfilled by determining a minimum cost policy of training or hiring.</br>
