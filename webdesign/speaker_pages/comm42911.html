<br>Title: Prediction of Warranty Repair Demand Considering New Sales and Failed-but-not-reported Phenomena</br><br>Author: Haitao Liao, Associate Professor, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, hliao@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Xie</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical model for predicting warranty repair demands for a new product covered by a non-renewable free minimal-repair warranty policy. We consider that the installed base of the product varies with time due to both new sales and units being taken out of service. In particular, failed-but-not-reported phenomena with time-dependent warranty claim probability are considered.</br>
