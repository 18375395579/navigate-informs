Title: Modeling the Impact of Carbon Footprint in a Supply Chain with Multiple Transportation Options<br>Author: Feng Cheng, Dr., IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, fcheng@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Jin Dong, Young Lee, Tom Ervolina, Hongwei Ding, Wei Wang, Changrui Ren<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: With the increased awareness on environmentally friendly supply chain, we develop an inventory optimization model that takes into account the impact of carbon emissions associated with the transportation options for the inbound logistics of a supply chain with offshore manufacturing. The model optimizes jointly the order quantity and the transportation mode while minimizing the total transportation and inventory costs subject to service level targets and carbon emission constraints.
