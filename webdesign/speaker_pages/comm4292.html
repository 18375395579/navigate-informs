Title: Space Network Scenarios for Intelligent Internet Protocol<br>Author: Hyun Kim, PhD Student, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Olin 613, Cleveland, 44106, United States, hsk5@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Behnam Malakooti<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The space networks differ significantly from the terrestrial networks. We have developed Intelligent Internet Protocol (IIP) to accommodate constraints posed by the space networks.  In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the IIP six functionalities, we develop a comprehensive scenario for each of surface and orbital networks that closely resemble actual space operations.  Using these scenarios, we demonstrate the implementation and applications of IIP.
