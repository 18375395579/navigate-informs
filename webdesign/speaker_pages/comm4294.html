<br>Title: Robust Support Vector Machine Training via Convex Outlier Ablation</br><br>Author: Linli Xu, University of Alberta, AICML lab, Dept. of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, linli@cs.ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dale Schuurmans, Koby Crammer</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: One of the well known risks of support vector machines (SVMs) is their sensitivity to outliers. These risks are normally mitigated by using a soft margin criterion. In this paper, we present a more direct approach that explicitly incorporates outlier suppression in the training process. In particular, by expressing a convex relaxation of the joint training problem as a semidefinite program, one can robustly train an SVM while suppressing outliers.</br>
