These results can be used to evaluate the quality of the square root staffing formula. We show analytically why this staffing formula works so well - even for small systems. In addition, we show how the Halfin-Whitt approximation can be adapted in such a way that it becomes accurate for systems which are not in heavy traffic or systems with a small number of servers.</br>
