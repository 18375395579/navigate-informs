To determine the percentage of open appointments, we introduce a mean-variance model, and develop a procedure to search all Pareto optimal solutions to the model. Our numerical results show that provider capacity and average demand for open appointments considerably affect the Pareto optimal expectations and variances of the number of patients consulted.</br>
