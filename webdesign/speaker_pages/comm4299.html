Title: Joint Panel Sizing and Appointment Scheduling in Outpatient Care<br>Author: Christos Zacharias, New York University, Stern School of Business, 44 West 4th Street, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, czachari@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mor Armony<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the joint problem of determining the panel size of a medical practice and the number of offered appointments per day, so that patients do not face long backlogs and the clinic is not overcrowded. By capturing many features of the healthcare system (balking, no-shows, random services), we model explicitly the two time scales involved in accessing care: out-of-clinic and in-clinic waits. Our analysis suggests that an “Open Access?policy is optimal in outpatient scheduling.
