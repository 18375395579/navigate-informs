<br>Title: Interdependent Vulnerability Analysis of Multi-commodity Transportation Networks</br><br>Author: Mohamad Darayi, PhD Student, University of Oklahoma, 202 W. Boyd St., Room 435, Norman, OK, 73019, United States of America, Mohamad.Darayi-1@ou.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kash Barker</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The vital role that the freight network plays in transporting raw materials and final products between manufacturing and consumption centers highlights its position in the economy. This network is susceptible to disruptions which result in some nodes or links becoming inactive. This research studies the vulnerability of a multi-commodity freight transportation network in the context of economic interdependency impact, integrating network flow techniques with inoperability input-output model.</br>
