Title: Approximations for Information Propagation Speed in Delay-tolerant Connected Vehicle Networks<br>Author: Kai Yin, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, United States of America, yinkai1000@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In a delay-tolerant connected vehicle network, the message carried by vehicles propagates at vehicles' travel speed when vehicles disconnect with each other. Otherwise, the message propagates instantaneously through the multihop connectivity.  In this study, we propose some approximation methods to obtain estimates of information propagation speed on bidirectional highways. The methods enable us to address not only Poisson but also general vehicle headway distributions.
