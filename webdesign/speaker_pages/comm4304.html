Title: Network Fairness in Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM)<br>Author: Douglas Fearing, Ph.D Student, MIT Operations Research Center, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Building E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, dfearing@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas, Amedeo Odoni<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We extend a network formulation for ATFM with a measure of fairness.  This extension is consistent with highly successful practices.  Additionally, we show how we can incorporate a three-stage Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) approach.  For the single-airport case, we compare our three-stage approach to the three-stage approach utilized in a CDM-enhanced GDP.  In our computational results, we use simple network scenarios to demonstrate the trade-off between system delay and fairness.
