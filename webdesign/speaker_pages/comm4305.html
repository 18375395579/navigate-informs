We first select a path in the tumor, along which the radiation will be deposited, and then develop mixed-integer models (and their linear approximations) to find the optimal beam durations for the chosen path. Several criteria are considered, including speed and movement accuracy. Our models yield clinically acceptable treatments while improving treatment time compared to forward and inverse step-and-shoot plans.</br>
