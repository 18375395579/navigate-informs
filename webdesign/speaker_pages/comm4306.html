Title: Multistage Recovery of Transportation Networks<br>Author: P.R. Raghavender, University of California-Davis, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Davis, CA, 95616, United States, ragpalavadi@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yueyue Fan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Recovery of transportation networks has traditionally been modeled as a single stage problem. Here we will propose a multistage network recovery procedure that identifies the optimal sequence of recovery to maximize the total societal benefits accrued during the recovery period. This model offers higher flexibility in terms of incorporating various uncertainties into the decision making process.
