<br>Title: Modeling EMS Yellow Alert Periods as Partial Busy Periods</br><br>Author: Amir Rastpour, University of Alberta, School of Business, Edmonton, AB, T6G2R6, Canada, rastpour@ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bora Kolfal, Armann Ingolfsson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A “k-partial busy period?in a multi-server system, where k or more servers busy, corresponds to a “yellow alert?period for an ambulance system, where the number of free ambulances drops below a threshold. We compute expected values and Laplace transforms of partial busy period durations in a loss system.  We show that the expected durations are insensitive to the service time distribution and that if service times are GH-distributed then the partial busy periods are GH-distributed.</br>
