Title: Optimal Policies for Inventory Systems with Ordering Postponement<br>Author: Qing Li, Hong Kong Univ of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, imqli@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Xiaoli Wu, Ki Ling Cheung<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A retailer replenishes its inventory by first making a delivery request at a fixed cost without specifying a quantity and then placing an order when a delivery vehicle arrives after one period. We show that the optimal policy on delivery requests follows a simple threshold structure. However, the optimal policy for ordering decisions is complex and hence a simple heuristic is proposed and tested.
