Title: Scheduling on a Channel with Failures and Retransmissions<br>Author: Evangelia Skiani, Columbia University, 423 West 118th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, es3009@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Predrag Jelenkovic<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In communication systems, retransmission-based failure recovery represents a foundation for mechanisms that guarantee successful data delivery in the presence of failures. It was shown that retransmissions can cause heavy-tailed delays even if all traffic and network characteristics are light-tailed. Here, we consider transmitting data over a channel of fixed capacity that fails between successive iid availability periods. We study the impact of scheduling strategies on the system performance.
