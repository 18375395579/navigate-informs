Title: Data-driven Appointment Scheduling in the Presence of No-shows<br>Author: Michele Samorani, Alberta School of Business, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, samorani@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Linda LaGanga<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling outpatient appointments in the presence of no-shows. Predictive analytics is used to forecast the show outcome of appointment requests, which are optimally scheduled given this prediction. Descriptive analytics is used to interpret the solutions of the scheduling problem in order to derive a heuristic policy, which, depending on the show rate and on the prediction quality, outperforms the reigning scheduling policy, open access. Prescriptive analytics is used to identify the conditions under which one should adopt overbooking or same-day scheduling. We validate our findings on the data set of a large mental health center
