<br>Title: Approximation Algorithms for Capacitated Stochastic Inventory Systems with Setup Cost</br><br>Author: Cong Shi, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, shicong@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi, Xiuli Chao, Huanan Zhang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop the first approximation algorithm with worst-case performance guarantee for capacitated stochastic periodic-review inventory systems with setup cost. We construct efficient near-optimal policies for these systems whose demands can be correlated over time, and show that these policies have a worst-case performance guarantee of 4. We also demonstrate that the policies empirically perform close to optimal, which is significantly better than the theoretical worst-case guarantee.</br>
