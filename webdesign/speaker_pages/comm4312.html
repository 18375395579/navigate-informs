<br>Title: Joint Bed Capacity Planning and Nurse Staffing in Medical Units</br><br>Author: Francis de Vericourt, Professor, European School of Management and Technology, devericourt@esmt.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Otis Jennings</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Using many-server queuing models, we jointly determine the number of nurses and beds in hospital units to guaranty specified levels of quality of care and bed availability. In our system patients arrive exogenously and, once space is available, are assigned beds. Admitted patients may become needy and require a nurse to restore them to a content state. Content patients either become needy again or are discharged.</br>
