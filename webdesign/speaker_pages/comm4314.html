Many  constraints exist on routing cars on trains, including terminal capacities, restrictions on length and weight of trains, etc. Given a schedule for trains, we use a multicommodity flow approach to routing cars on trains while jointly considering block definitions and real-time exceptions. We will present case-studies of the application of the approach.</br>
