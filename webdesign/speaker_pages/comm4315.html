<br>Title: The Benefit of Introducing Variability in Quality Based Service Domains</br><br>Author: Ying Xu, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, yingx1@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Scheller-Wolf, Katia Sycara</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a single-server queueing system in which the value customers obtain from service increases with service time but decreases with waiting time. We show that the system value can be improved by differentiating a homogeneous customer group into different service rates, even if the service rates are assigned independent of system state. Though such a differentiation service increases service time variance, the total waiting time can be reduced without affecting the total service time.</br>
