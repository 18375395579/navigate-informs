Title: PROTECT: A Deployed Game Theoretic System to Protect the Ports of the United States<br>Author: Milind Tambe, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, tambe@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eric Shieh, Bo An, Rong Yang, Fei Fang, Albert Xin Jiang, Craig Baldwin, Joseph DiRenzo, Ben Maule, Garrett Meyer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: PROTECT is a game-theoretic system deployed by the United States Coast  Guard in the port of Boston for scheduling their patrols.  PROTECT offers several key innovations. First, this system is a departure from  the assumption of perfect adversary rationality, relying instead on a quantal response (QR) model of the adversary. Second, We present two new  algorithms for computing defender  strategies in this QR model. Third, we generate a compact representation of the defender's strategy space.
