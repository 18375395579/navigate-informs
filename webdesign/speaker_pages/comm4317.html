<br>Title: Using Interval Predictions for Forecasting</br><br>Author: Leonard Wolk, Maastricht University, PO Box 616, Maastricht, Netherlands, l.wolk@maastrichtuniversity.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ronald Peeters</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Predicting future events through aggregating information using market mechanisms has been studied extensively. Yet, implementing a market mechanism is not always feasible. In this paper we propose an alternative mechanism to aggregate beliefs about termination times of a stochastic process, by means of point and interval guessing tasks. Our experiment reveals that the Hellinger distance to the true distribution drops by 25% when increasing the aggregation level from two to eight individuals.</br>
