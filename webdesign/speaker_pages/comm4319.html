Title: Planning with Multiple SRUs in SAROPS<br>Author: Thomas Kratzke, Senior Analyst, Metron, Inc., Reston, VA, United States of America, tkratzke@metsci.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: When assigning rectangular search areas to multiple Search units, one is faced with a large set of constraints.  For example, there is a relatively small number of dimensions for each rectangle, and some of the rectangles cannot overlap.    In this talk, we discuss the constraints, and the algorithm that we used to find good rectangles for the SRUs.
