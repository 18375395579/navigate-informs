<br>Title: No Soup for You! Intentionally Unsatisfied Demand and Future Production</br><br>Author: Reynold Byers, University of California, Irvine, SB 309, The Paul Merage School of Business, Irvine, CA, 92697, United States, RByers@uci.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Huff</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Intentional shortages are a surprising practical reality.  There are several examples of fashion labels that specifically leave known demand unfilled. We explore the relationship of demand with fulfillment in a two-period setting. We assume that unfulfilled demand in the first period creates a ``buzz that increases demand in the second period. We model the problem first with deterministic demand and then again incorporating demand variability.</br>
