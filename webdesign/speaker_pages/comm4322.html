The 2005 timetable of Berlin Underground---valid since December 12, 2004---is the first mathematically optimized service concept for a public transportation network that got into daily operation.  The result of our computations is a timetable that offers shorter passenger waiting times---both for transfers and stopovers. Moreover, it requires one train less for operation than the previous timetable. Solving the resulting IPs, we profited from new insights into integral cycle bases of directed graphs, which provide us with better lower bounds for our minimization problem.</br>
