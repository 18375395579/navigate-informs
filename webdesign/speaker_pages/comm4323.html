Title: Valuing Changes in Investment Opportunities<br>Author: Ali Abbas, Associate Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61822, United States of America, aliabbas@illinois.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: I introduce two new measures for characterizing changes in the valuation of uncertain lotteries when their outcomes are modified by a monotone transformation. The first is a characteristic transformation whose shape determines bounds on the certainty equivalent of the modified lottery. The second is a measure of change whose magnitude determines the change in value of a “small-risk?lottery when its outcomes are modified by a monotone transformation.
