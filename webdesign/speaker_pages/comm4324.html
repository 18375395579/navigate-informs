Title: Real-time Integrated Airport Surface Movement Controlling<br>Author: Yu Zhang, University of South Florida, Civil and Environmental Engineering Dept, 4202 East Fowler Ave., Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, yuzhang@usf.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The basic idea of the real-time integrated airport surface controlling is to determine the sequence and passage times of arrival and departure aircraft at airport surface that minimize total taxi time and maximize runway throughput subject to the operational constraints and safety requirements. It will improve the efficiency of airport utilization and help reduce air pollutant emissions near airports. It will also increase the predictability of flight operations and benefit downstream flows.
