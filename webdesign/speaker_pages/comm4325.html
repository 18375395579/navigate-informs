Building on work  by Gromoll&Williams, we obtain a multidimensional fixed point equation for the growth rates of the number of users. Uniqueness of solutions to this fixed point equation is shown by identifying an associated convex programming problem, which is shown to imply uniqueness of the GW fluid model solution assuming an empty network at time 0.</br>
