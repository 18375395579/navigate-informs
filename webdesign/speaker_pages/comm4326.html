<br>Title: A Proposed Multi-agent Framework for Future Global Force Management (GFM)</br><br>Author: Greg Godfrey, Senior Manager, Metron, Inc., 11911 Freedom Drive, Suite 800, Reston, VA, 20190, United States of America, godfrey@metsci.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Charles H. Shaw, III</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Future operations by the US Military Services will require greater collaboration within the government and with the private sector. Commercial enterprises that normally compete with one another will have to cooperate to satisfy the goals of our National Security and Military Strategies in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and other operations.  Of particular interest is the management of human capital/ personnel which is the focus of a new Global Force Management System (GFMS) and emerging policies, standards, and methods vice existing Military Service and Government Agency centric Personnel Management Systems.  This presentation will provide insights into and lessons learned from other “Global?efforts to optimize constrained resources under stochastic conditions with often significant uncertainty across organizations, time and space.  A market-based approach currently implemented for constrained supplies and services called the Virtual Personnel Command (VPC) will also be presented using autonomous Software Agents (SWA) to represent the interests of each Service and Agency collaboratively.  Benefits of this approach will be discussed explaining how the Military Services and Government Agencies can receive the best overall personnel utilization, including critical skill sets, at lower cost with fewer total personnel while balancing operational and training requirements and minimizing the disruption to the day-to-day operations by the force.</br>
