Title: Project Planning with Uncertain Activity Durations<br>Author: Jonathan Bard, Professor, The University of Texas, 1 University Station C2200, Mechanical Engineering, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, jbard@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guidong Zhu, Gang Yu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk discusses the problem of setting target finish times (due dates) for project activities with random durations. Using two-stage integer linear stochastic programming, target times are determined in the first stage followed by the development of a detailed project schedule in the second stage. The objective is to balance (1) The cost of project completion as a function of activity target times with (2) The expected penalty incurred by deviating from the specified values.
