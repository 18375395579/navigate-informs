Using two-stage integer linear stochastic programming, target times are determined in the first stage followed by the development of a detailed project schedule in the second stage. The objective is to balance (1) The cost of project completion as a function of activity target times with (2) The expected penalty incurred by deviating from the specified values.</br>
