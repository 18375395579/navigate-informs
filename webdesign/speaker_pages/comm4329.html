Title: Minimizing Earliness, Tardiness and Due Date Costs on Uniform Parallel Machines with Identical Jobs<br>Author: Jeffrey B. Sidney, Professor, University of Ottawa, 136 Jean-Jacques-Lussier, Ottawa, ON, K1N 6N5, Canada, jbsidney@hotmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Inna G. Drobouchevitch<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of sequencing n identical jobs with a common due date on m uniform parallel machines. The objective is to jointly determine an optimal value of the due date and an optimal allocation of jobs to machines to minimize a total penalty function, which is a function of earliness, tardiness and due-date values. The main result is an efficient polynomial algorithm that solves the problem to optimality.
