Title: Underlying Models for Service Expectation Setting Mechanism in Air Traffic Flow Management<br>Author: Prem Swaroop, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland, RH Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, pswaroop@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The shared and common threat of inclement weather forces the competing airlines to seek consensus regarding their ATM service level expectations. We present a mechanism that effectively finds consensus-based design solution that has many desirable properties - including high accuracy, confidentiality and strategy-resistance. We present the the optimization models and statistical estimation methods underlying the mechanism, and show its effectiveness through a large simulation run.
