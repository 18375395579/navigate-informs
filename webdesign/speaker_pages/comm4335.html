Title: Adaptive Orienteering Problem with Stochastic Travel Times<br>Author: Irina Dolinskaya, Assistant Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, IEMS, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States of America, dolira@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhenyu (Edwin) Shi, Karen Smilowitz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the setting of search and rescue (SAR) operations following a disaster, where the goal is to search collapsed structures within the area to rescue as many survivors as possible within a deadline.  The decision problem of a SAR team can be formalized as an adaptive orienteering problem with stochastic travel times that integrates path finding between the reward nodes. We present the model, algorithms and analysis of results.
