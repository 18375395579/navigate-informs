Title: Dual Characterization of Properties of Risk Measures<br>Author: Patrick Cheridito, Professor, Princeton University, dito@Princeton.EDU<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We give a representation result for risk measures on Orlicz hearts. Then we provide general conditions for Gateaux-differentiability, strict monotonicity with respect to almost sure inequality, strict convexity modulo translation, strict convexity modulo comonotonicity, and  monotonicity with respect to different stochastic orders. The theoretical results are applied to analyze various specific examples of risk measures. Some of them have appeared in earlier papers, others are new.
