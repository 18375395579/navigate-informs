<br>Title: Operations Research for Investment Analysis in Integrated & Fast-growing Electricity-gas Markets</br><br>Author: Niko Iliadis, Engineering Analyst, EnerCoRD, Plastira street 4, Nea Smyrni, Athens, 171 21, Greece, Niko.ILIADIS@EnerCoRD.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Luiz Augusto Barroso</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss available optimization techniques and tools for regional integration of electricity-gas markets in Latin America. For example, energy swaps with LNG are more economical than point to point gas pipelines. An example is the gas export from Brazil to Chile without gas or pipeline: Chile purchases electricity from Brazil for delivery in Argentina (via the Brazil-Argentina DC link), this power displaces gas-fired generation in Argentina, which frees up gas supply to be shipped to Chile.</br>
