<br>Title: MDP and Simulation for Efficient Blood Platelet Production and Improved Platelet Transfusion</br><br>Author: Rene Haijema, Wageningen University and Research center, Hollandseweg 1, Wageningen, Netherlands, rene.haijema@wur.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jan van der Wal, Nico van Dijk, Nikky Kortbeek</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Blood banks produce platelet pools to meet uncertain demand. Optimal production volumes are obtained by solving a (downsized) Markov decision problem (MDP). Nearly-optimal replenishment levels are read by simulating the MDP strategy. The optimal strategy balances shortages and outdating. The quality of the pools upon transfusion is negatively correlated with their age. We present several ways to improve platelet quality given the MDP-Simulation approach to obtain fixed order-up-to levels.</br>
