Title: Hierarchical Bayesian Networks for Stochastic Freight Truck Demand Estimation<br>Author: Yinyi Ma, Erasmus University, Burg, Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, Netherlands, yma@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Kuik Roelof, Henk van Zuylen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian Networks (HBN) are applied to estimate freight truck demand. The measurements from link flow such as loop detectors and path flow from such as cameras are the evidences to update prior demand. We consider multiplicative errors in the measurements, instead of additive errors. It requires Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo simulation.
