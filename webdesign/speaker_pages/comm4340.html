<br>Title: A Universal Scheme for Learning</br><br>Author: Vivek Farias, Graduate Student, Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, 274 Packard Electrical Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, vivekf@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ciamac Moallemi, Benjamin Van Roy, Tsachy Weissman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider an agent interacting with an unmodeled environment.  At each time, the agent makes an observation, takes an action, and incurs a cost. Actions can influence future observations and costs.  The goal is to minimize long-run average cost. We propose an algorithm inspired by the Lempel-Ziv scheme for data compression. We  establish that if the future is conditionally independent of the past given a finite window of actions and observations, average cost converges to the optimum.</br>
