Title: Online Traveling Salesman Problem on Graphs<br>Author: Swati Gupta, ORC, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-149, CAMBRIDGE, MA, 02139, United States of America, swatig@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michel Goemans, Patrick Jaillet<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We give a 3-competitive polynomial time algorithm for nomadic online TSP on undirected edge-weighted graphs. Requests arrive on the vertices of the given graph and can be served only after their release time. We further restrict the server to not re-route on an edge. This algorithm generalizes to metric spaces.
