Title: Dynamic Casualty Routing in the Aftermath of a Mass-casualty Event<br>Author: Alex Mills, Indiana University Kelley School of Business, 1309 E. Tenth Street, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, millsaf@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nilay Argon, Serhan Ziya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a model for dynamic routing of a large number of casualties in the aftermath of a mass-casualty event.  The casualties, who are distributed at multiple locations, require transportation to one of several collection points, where they wait to receive service (e.g., medical treatment or decontamination).  We partially characterize the solution that maximizes the discounted throughput, and we develop effective heuristic policies.
