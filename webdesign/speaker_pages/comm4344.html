Title: A Capacity Planning Model for Internal Access Within a Large Integrated Academic Practice<br>Author: Brian Bailey, Operations Research Analyst, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, United States of America, bailey.brian@mayo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hari Balasubramanian<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Within an integrated medical practice, appointment capacity is allocated between varying sources of demand. New medical encounters are often booked weeks in advance, whereas internal downstream referrals are requested within a few days. Using actual appointment and resource data from Mayo Clinic of Rochester, we introduce a multi-period planning model to forecast internal demand. The model is being evaluated as a short-range planning tool to assign capacity and minimize schedule changes.
