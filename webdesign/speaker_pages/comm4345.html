Title: Multi-Sensor Target Tracking: A Probabilistic Combinatorial Analysis<br>Author: Paul Krokhmal, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, 2403 SC, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, krokhmal@engineering.uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a random Multidimensional Assignment Problem in application to multi-sensor tracking of multiple mobile targets. A probabilistic analysis of the problem, including convergence of optimal value, estimation of the number of local minima, properties of the solution landscape, etc. is presented.
