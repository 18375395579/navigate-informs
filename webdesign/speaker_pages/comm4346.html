<br>Title: Hydroelectric Scheduling: Empirical Evidence</br><br>Author: Stein-Erik Fleten, Norwegian U of Science and Technology, Alfred Getz v. 3, Trondheim, Norway, stein-erik.fleten@iot.ntnu.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jussi Keppo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Electricity companies owning storage hydroelectric plants have a complex task of scheduling the release of water from reservoirs, under uncertainty of prices and inflows. Optimization problems are solved every week to support this activity. Using weekly data from 13 Norwegian power plants in the period 2000-2006, we investigate the factors that drive the production schedules and how scheduling is performed.</br>
