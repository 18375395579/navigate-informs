We present an algorithm to generate optimal vessel loading plans. We consider disutility from container rehandling, ground travel, and on-board weight distribution. The algorithm uses Lagrangian relaxation to generate bounds within a branch and bound framework. Computational performance is assessed using data from a Spanish terminal.</br>
