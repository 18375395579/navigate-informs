Title: A Lagrangian Relaxation Approach to the Vessel Planning Problem<br>Author: Jose Fernando Alvarez, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Ramon Trias Fargas, 25, Barcelona, 08005, Spain, josefernando.alvarez@upf.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The vessel plan must comply with the stowage instructions provided by the shipping company, but should also expedite container transport operations in the yard. We present an algorithm to generate optimal vessel loading plans. We consider disutility from container rehandling, ground travel, and on-board weight distribution. The algorithm uses Lagrangian relaxation to generate bounds within a branch and bound framework. Computational performance is assessed using data from a Spanish terminal.
