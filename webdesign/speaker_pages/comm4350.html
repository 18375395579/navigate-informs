Title: Monotonicity of Thresholds and Switching Curves in Queueing Control<br>Author: Flora Spieksma, Leiden University, Niels Bohrweg 2, Leiden, Netherlands, spieksma@math.leidenuniv.nl<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Optimality of threshold policies in arrival control of single server queues is often  proved through the successive approximations algorithm for Markov Decision Processes.  Interestingly enough, the same algorithm can be used to show monotonicity of the threshold  as a function of the iteration step. This allows to  obtain bounds for the optimal  threshold.  Similar phenomena occur in two-dimensional optimal control models where  a switching curve, instead of an index policy, is optimal. We discuss various examples.
