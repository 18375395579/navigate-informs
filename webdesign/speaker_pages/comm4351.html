Title: Minimax Flow Tree Problems<br>Author: Hui Chen, The University of Iowa, S210 John Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, IA, 52242-1000, United States, hui-chen@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Barrett Thomas, Arie Tamir, Ann Campbell<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Delivery companies want to design delivery networks that are both low cost and meet the service requirements of their customers. With this in mind, we will examine many different variants in assumptions and objective function for designing tree-structured delivery networks. We will examine their complexity and introduce new polynomial algorithms for efficiently solving certain variants.
