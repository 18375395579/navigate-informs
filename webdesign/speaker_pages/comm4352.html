A supply chain agent analyses the current state of the SC and uses a structured set of optimization models to compute decision alternatives in order to find out how to fulfill customer orders. This alternatives are the basis of negotiation processes between the SC-agent and customer agents. We will explain the advantages of the integrated optimization-negotiation approach.</br>
