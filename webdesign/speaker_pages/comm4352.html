Title: Improving Supply Chain Execution by an Integrated Optimization- Negotiation Approach<br>Author: Hans-Juergen Sebastian, Deutsche Post Chair of Optimization of Distribution Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Templergraben 64, Aachen, 52062, Germany, Sebastian@or.rwth-aachen.de<br>Coauthor(s): Christoph Hempsch, Tung Bui<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the execution phase of SCM. A supply chain agent analyses the current state of the SC and uses a structured set of optimization models to compute decision alternatives in order to find out how to fulfill customer orders. This alternatives are the basis of negotiation processes between the SC-agent and customer agents. We will explain the advantages of the integrated optimization-negotiation approach.
