Title: Intersection Signal Optimization using Queue Length Estimation<br>Author: Yang Cheng, Research Associate, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2204 Engineering Hall, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, cheng8@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Ban, Bin Ran<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: By modern traffic detection technologies, traffic condition data would have higher resolution in time and space, which is especially valuable for the interrupted traffic on signalized intersections. The queue length can be estimated more easily and accurately. Therefore, this study proposes a new signal control optimization method based on queue information to improve corridor coordination. The simulation results indicate that this approach has better performance than traditional control methods.
