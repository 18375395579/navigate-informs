Title: No-holdback Allocation Rules for Continuous-time Assemble-to-order Systems<br>Author: Yao Zhao, Rutgers University, 180 University Ave, Newark, 07102, United States of America, yaozhao@andromeda.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yingdong Lu, Jeannette Song<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a class of dynamic component allocation rules, termed  no-holdback (NHB) rules, in continuous-review, multi-product assemble-to-order (ATO) systems. The lead times are positive and not necessarily identical. We analyzed the optimality condition for this class of rules and developed tools for performance evaluation. We also compared NHB rules to the common used FIFO allocation rule.
