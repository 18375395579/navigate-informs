Title: Selfish or Altruistic? The Impact of Customer Routing in a Self-service Queue<br>Author: Hakjin Chung, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, 710 Tappan St., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, hakjin@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyun-Soo Ahn, Rhonda Righter<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a firm who can provide service in both full-service and self-service modes and examine how customer's selfishness to improve their own utility influences the optimal service rate for full service.   We show that selfish routing increases the traffic toward the full service. Consequently, the provider tends to build a higher capacity than when customers self-regulate to increase the traffic.
