<br>Title: Pups vs. Vans: Trailer Mix Decisions for LTL Linehaul Operations</br><br>Author: J. Antonio Carbajal, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, gtg107u@mail.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Erera, Martin Savelsbergh</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: LTL carriers can attain cost savings by correctly identifying the types of trailer equipment to use on different linehaul service lanes. To date, research has focused on short haul mix problems. Given a load plan, we investigate models to determine which direct trailer moves should be loaded with pups (28?trailers) and which with vans (53?trailers). We attempt to specify the simplest nontrivial problem and present an arc-based IP formulation. Computational results are shown for test instances.</br>
