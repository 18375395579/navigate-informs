Title: Conflict Hypergraphs in Integer Programming<br>Author: Siddhartha Maheshwary, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, sid@isye.gatech.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the facial structure of the independent set polytope using conflict hypergraphs. Various structures such as cliques, odd holes, odd antiholes, webs and antiwebs are identified on the conflict hypergraph, and valid inequalities are derived.
