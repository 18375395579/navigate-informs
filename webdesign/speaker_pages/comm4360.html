Title: A Bilevel Model for Retail Electricity Pricing with Flexible Loads<br>Author: Lin He, PhD Candidate, Lehigh University, H.S. Mohler Laboratory, 200 West Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, lih308@Lehigh.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Larry Snyder<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider an electricity service provider that wishes to set prices for a large customer with flexible loads so that the resulting load profile matches a predetermined profile as closely as possible. Assuming the customer minimizes its electricity and delay costs, we model this as a bilevel problem in which the provider sets prices and the customer responds by shifting loads forward in time. We derive optimality conditions for the lower-level problem to obtain a single-level problem.
