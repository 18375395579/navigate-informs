<br>Title: Inventory Based Allocation Policies for Flexible Servers in Serial Systems</br><br>Author: Maria Mayorga, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, Freeman Hall Box 34020, Clemson, SC, United States of America, mayorga@CLEMSON.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Taaffe, Ramesh Arumugam</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by industrial applications, we study the allocation of a flexible server in a serial process.  Rather than using standard server vacation rules, we consider polling policies that are characterized by endogenous parameters, such as inventory levels, with the goal of maximizing throughput.  We analyze this problem using queuing theory and simulation when needed.</br>
