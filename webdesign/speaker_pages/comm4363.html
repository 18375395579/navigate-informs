<br>Title: On Deciding Stability of Multiclass Queueing Networks under Buffer Priority Scheduling Policies</br><br>Author: Dmitriy Katz, MIT, Operations Research Center, dimdim@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: One of the basic properties of a queueing network is stability. Roughly   Speaking it is the property that the total number of jobs in the network remains bounded as a  function of time. One of the key questions related to the stability issue is determining   the exact conditions under which a given queueing network operating under a given scheduling   policy stable. While initially there was a lot of progress in addressing this question, most of the obtained results were partial at best, and the complete characterization of stable queueing networks is lacking. In this paper we resolve this important open problem, albeit in a somewhat  unexpected way. We show that characterizing stable queueing networks is an   algorithmically undecidable problem for the case of non-preemptive static buffer priority scheduling policies and deterministic interarrival and service times. Thus no constructive characterization of stable queueing networks operating under this class of policies is possible.</br>
