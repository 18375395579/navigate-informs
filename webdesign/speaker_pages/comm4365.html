Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming for Serial Multi-echelon Systems with Economies of Scale<br>Author: Diego Klabjan, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, Ind. Eng. and Mgmt. Sci., d-klabjan@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Xie<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The value function of a serial systems with economies of scale is very complex and the underlying policies are not structured. We present a computational study based on algorithms that combine Monte-Carlo sampling and optimization. Various approximations to the value function are discussed.
