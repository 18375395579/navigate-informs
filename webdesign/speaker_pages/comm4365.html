<br>Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming for Serial Multi-echelon Systems with Economies of Scale</br><br>Author: Diego Klabjan, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, Ind. Eng. and Mgmt. Sci., d-klabjan@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Xie</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The value function of a serial systems with economies of scale is very complex and the underlying policies are not structured. We present a computational study based on algorithms that combine Monte-Carlo sampling and optimization. Various approximations to the value function are discussed.</br>
