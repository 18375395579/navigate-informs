Title: Optimal Scheduling of Products with Two Subassemblies and Changeover Cost<br>Author: Feng Zhou, student, Indiana University Bloomington, 1309 E. 10th Street, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, fengzhou@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Blocher, Sebastian Heese, Xinxin Hu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling products with two subassemblies on a common resource, where changeovers incur fixed costs. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of flow time and changeover cost. We provide properties of optimal solutions and characterize optimal schedules. Our results have interesting implications for practice, primarily that the structure of the optimal schedule is robust to changes in demand.
