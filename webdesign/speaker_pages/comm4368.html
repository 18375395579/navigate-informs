<br>Title: Valid Inequalities for the 1-Restricted Simple 2-Matching Polytope</br><br>Author: Yanjun Li, Associate Professor of Management, Purdue University, 403 West State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, li14@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Hartvigsen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A simple 2-matching in a simple undirected graph is a subgraph with node degree 1 or 2. A simple 2-matching is called 1-restricted if each of its connected components has at least two edges. We introduce two classes of valid inequalities for the 1-restricted simple 2-matching polytope: r-1 and r-2 blossom inequalities. We characterize the facet inducing r-1 and r-2 blossom inequalities on a class of 1-restricted blossoms, and characterize the facet inducing r-2 blossom inequalities with depth 2.</br>
