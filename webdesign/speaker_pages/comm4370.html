Title: A Simple Mathematical Formulation for Maximum Coverage Routing Without Cycles<br>Author: Srinivas Peeta, Professor, Purdue University, Civil Engineering, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN, 47907-2051, United States, peeta@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Georgios Kalafatas<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In a maximum coverage problem, cyclical routes are mostly meaningless or unwanted, depending on the physical interpretation of the routing scheme. In the context of the reinforcement of a seismically prone network for minimum cost and maximum coverage routing of emergency responders, a typical set of constraints for handling the unwanted cycles explode the problem size. We propose a significantly smaller set of constraints for handling the unwanted cycles based on a simple graph concept.
