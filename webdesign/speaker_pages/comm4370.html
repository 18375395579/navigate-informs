In the context of the reinforcement of a seismically prone network for minimum cost and maximum coverage routing of emergency responders, a typical set of constraints for handling the unwanted cycles explode the problem size. We propose a significantly smaller set of constraints for handling the unwanted cycles based on a simple graph concept.</br>
