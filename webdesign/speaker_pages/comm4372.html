<br>Title: Multicommodity Logistics Network Design Models with Inventory Stocking and Part Commonality</br><br>Author: Vishv Jeet, PhD candidate, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, C2200, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, vjeet_a@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erhan Kutanoglu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We address problems with strong interactions between network design and inventory decisions in service parts logistics. Expanding our analysis with variable substitution and outer approximation for single part models, we analyze the multi-product multi-part settings. The challenge is to satisfy time-based product-level service constraints for geographically dispersed customers when locating/stocking facilities with parts common across products. We present bounding and exact solution techniques.</br>
