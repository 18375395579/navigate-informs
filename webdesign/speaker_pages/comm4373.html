Title: A Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for Single-Item Stochastic Lot-Sizing Problems<br>Author: Diego Klabjan, Associate Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1206 West Green Street, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, klabjan@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nir Halman, David Simchi-Levi, James Orlin, M. Mostagir<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The single-item stochastic lot-sizing problem is to find an inventory replenishment policy in the presence  of a stochastic demand under periodic review and finite time horizon. In this paper we prove that  this problem is intractable and therefore we provide an approximation algorithm. To the best of our  knowledge, this is the first work that develops a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for this  problem.
