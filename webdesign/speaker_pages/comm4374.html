Title: Finding the Most Important Edges in a Network<br>Author: Kevin Hutson, Furman University, Greenville, SC, United States of America, kevin.hutson@furman.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Berry, Tim Chartier, Amy Langville<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: As teams play during a season a network encoding wins and losses of teams can be constructed.  There are several ranking methods that can be used on this win-loss network to produce a ranking of teams.  In this talk, we present several methods to determine which edges (games) in the network have the most influence in determining such a ranking order of the teams.  We apply these methods to college football to determine the most important, or influential, games in that season.
