<br>Title: Finding the Most Important Edges in a Network</br><br>Author: Kevin Hutson, Furman University, Greenville, SC, United States of America, kevin.hutson@furman.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Berry, Tim Chartier, Amy Langville</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: As teams play during a season a network encoding wins and losses of teams can be constructed.  There are several ranking methods that can be used on this win-loss network to produce a ranking of teams.  In this talk, we present several methods to determine which edges (games) in the network have the most influence in determining such a ranking order of the teams.  We apply these methods to college football to determine the most important, or influential, games in that season.</br>
