<br>Title: Control of Multi-class Queueing Networks with Infinite Virtual Queues</br><br>Author: Erjen Lefeber, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, 5600MB, Netherlands, A.A.J.Lefeber@tue.nl</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a generalization of the standard multi-class queueing network model by allowing both standard queues and infinite virtual queues which have infinite supply of work.  We present a possible solution to the problem of finding policies which allow some of the nodes of the network to work with full utilization, and yet keep all the standard queues in the system stable.</br>
