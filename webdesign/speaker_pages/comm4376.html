<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing with Minmax Regret</br><br>Author: Zhi-Long Chen, Professor, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, ZChen@RHSmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Hall</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a two-period dynamic pricing problem where the decision maker has little demand information available and only knows lower and upper bounds of the demand functions. The objective is to minimize maximum regret. We propose two modeling approaches and solve the underlying problem efficiently in each case.</br>
