We develop a simulation study to compare the performance of a manufacturing system under three different maintenance polices: a reliability-based preventive maintenance policy, a degradation-based predictive maintenance policy and a sensory-driven prognostic maintenance policy. System performance and maintenance costs are analyzed under several system reliability levels.</br>
