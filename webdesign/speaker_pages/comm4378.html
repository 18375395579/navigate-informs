Title: Factorizing High Dimensional Distributions via Alpha Complexes<br>Author: Simon Lunagomez, PhD Candidate, Duke University, Box 90251 Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, simon.lgz@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sayan Mukherhee, Robert Wolpert<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We are interested in modeling the dependence structure of multivariate heavy-tailed  distributions. By assuming conditional independence, a factorization of the distributions can be represented by a hypergraph. The combinatorial nature and exponential increase in complexity of hypergraph models result in computational problems. As an alternative we couple constructions from computational algebraic topology with copulas to obtain factorizations which are efficient to compute.
