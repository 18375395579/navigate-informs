Title: A Dynamic Crashing Method for Project Management Using Simulation-based Optimization<br>Author: Michael Kuhl, Associate Professor, Rochester Institute of Technology, Industrial & Systems Engineering Department, 81 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY, 14623, United States of America, mekeie@rit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Radhamés Tolentino-Peña<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A dynamic simulation-based crashing method is introduced to evaluate project networks and determine the optimum crashing configuration that minimizes the average project cost due to lateness penalties and crashing costs. The dynamic approach determines a crashing strategy at the beginning of the project and also during the life of the project so changes to the crashing strategy may be identified and implemented. The output includes the distribution of the project completion time and total cost.
