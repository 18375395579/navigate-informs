<br>Title: A General Class of Closed Fork and Join Queues with Subexponential Service Times</br><br>Author: Hayriye Ayhan, Georgia Tech, Stewart School of ISyE, Atlanta, GA, United States, hayhan@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jung-Kyung Kim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: For a general class of closed fork and join queueing networks, we derive the tail asymptotics of transient cycle times and waiting times under the assumption that the service time distribution of at least one station is subexponential. We also argue that under certain conditions the asymptotic tail distributions remain the same for stationary cycle times and waiting times.</br>
