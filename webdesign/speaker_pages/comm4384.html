<br>Title: Cost of Equity in Defensive Resource Allocations in the Face of a Strategic Attacker</br><br>Author: Xiaojun Shan, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, 435 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, xshan@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhuang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study trade-off between equity and efficiency by developing a game-theoretic model, where a government allocates defensive resources among multiple potential targets, while reserving a portion (represented by the equity coefficient) for equal distribution (according to geographical areas, population, density, etc.) The attack probabilities are endogenously determined. Cost of equity increases convexly in terms of additional expected loss.</br>
