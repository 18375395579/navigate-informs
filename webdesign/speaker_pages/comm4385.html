Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a searcher who seeks an immobile hider on an undirected network. The searcher may only traverse a finite number of edges along the search path. With each traversal of a network edge, the likelihood of discovering the hider upon that edge is reduced. A search path that maximizes the probability of discovering the hider is found.</br>
