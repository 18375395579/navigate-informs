Title: An Opportunistic Maintenance Policy for Components in Complex Systems Under Condition Monitoring<br>Author: Qiushi Zhu, Eindhoven University of Technology, De Lismortel, Paviljoen E.14, Eindhoven, 5600 MB, Netherlands, q.zhu@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Hao Peng, Geert-Jan van Houtum<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Due to the advanced sensor technologies nowadays, we can continuously monitor the degradation of critical components in complex systems to prevent the unexpected failures by condition-based maintenance (CBM) policies. How to coordinate different maintenance actions in the system becomes a challenging problem. We propose a new optimization model to determine the control limits of opportunistic maintenance for monitored components. Moreover, a case study in semiconductor industry is provided.
