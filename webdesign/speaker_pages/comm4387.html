Title: Capacitated Water Truck Routing Problem for Open Pit Mines<br>Author: Jing-Quan Li, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States, jingquan@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Knights, Paul Lever, Pitu Mirchandani<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Water trucks are used to maintain the condition of haul roads and reduce mine dust in open pit mines. Each road segment is assigned a watering frequency and a sliding time window. Multiple refill stations are available. We propose heuristics to solve this multi-depot, infinite horizon capacitated Chinese postman problem with time windows.
