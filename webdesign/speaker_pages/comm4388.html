<br>Title: Optimizing Biofuel Transportation and Refinery Locations in Illinois</br><br>Author: Seungmo Kang, Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, skang2@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hayri Onal, Umit Tursun, Jurgen Scheffran, Yanfeng Ouyang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We find the optimal locations and capacities of new biofuel refineries in Illinois, including expansion of the existing facilities, using a MIP facility location model. The model minimizes the total cost of crop production and harvesting, transportation costs between farms, refineries and consumers, and processing costs at the refineries. This problem is solved by both CPLEX and a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm. Numerical results are presented.</br>
