Title: Managing Morning Commute with Tradable Mobility Credits<br>Author: Marco Nie, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, y-nie@northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We assume that the congestion management authority will delineate a peak-time window and require all traveler who pass the bottleneck within that window to either pay certain units of mobility credits, or a peak time toll (which is comparably more expensive).  The authority rewards credits to anyone who passes the bottleneck during the designated off-peak time window.  An artificial market will be created so that the users may trade these credits with each other.
