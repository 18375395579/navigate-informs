Title: A Markov Decision Process Model for Optimal Timing of Biopsy in Breast Cancer Diagnosis<br>Author: Jagpreet Chhatwal, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 4126 Mechanical Engineering, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, jchhatwal@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Oguzhan Alagoz, Elizabeth Burnside<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: While diagnosing breast caner, 55-85% of the breast biopsies turn out to be benign, resulting in anxiety for the patients and unnecessary treatments. We use Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to find the optimal timing of the biopsy that maximizes the total quality-adjusted expected life of each patient. Our results also show that optimal biopsy decisions are age-dependent.
