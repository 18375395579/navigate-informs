<br>Title: Control of Patient Flow in Emergency Departments: Multiclass Queues with Feedback and Deadlines</br><br>Author: Junfei Huang, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117592, Singapore, junfeih@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Avishai Mandelbaum, Boaz Carmeli</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the control of patient flow through physicians in emergency departments: a choice must be made between triage patients who are yet to be checked vs. those who are in-process (IP). Physicians' capacity is modeled as a multi-class queueing system with feedback, in which triage patients face deadline constraints while IP patients incur delay costs. We propose and analyze a scheduling policy that minimizes total queueing cost while satisfying all constraints, asymptotically.</br>
