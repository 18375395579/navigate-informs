Title: Multi-resource Allocation Scheduling of Elective and Emergency Surgery in Dynamic Environments<br>Author: Van-Anh Truong, Columbia University, vt2196@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Huh, Nan Liu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We formulate the first model of allocation scheduling for  emergency and elective surgeries in a dynamic environment, where  distributional information about demand and resource availability is  continually updated and scheduling decisions exploit new information  as it arises.  We allow multiple resources to be considered, and  patients to renege.
