While Dell’s current planning process allocates demand to factories using a static map minimizing outbound costs, it recognizes the opportunity to rely instead on dynamic allocation maps minimizing inbound, outbound, and direct labor costs. We present an optimization model developed with Dell to exploit this opportunity and results showing significant savings potential.</br>
