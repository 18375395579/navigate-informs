<br>Title: Performance Analysis of Alternate Designs for Autonomous Vehicle based Storage and Retrieval Systems</br><br>Author: Debjit Roy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, droy@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Krishnamurthy</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval System (AVSRS) is an alternative to AS/RS systems. In existing AVSR systems, horizontal movement is through autonomous vehicles whereas the vertical movement is through lifts. We consider alternative designs that provide increased autonomy in horizontal and vertical movement and evaluate their performance using queuing models.</br>
