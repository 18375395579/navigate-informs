Title: Optimal Trade Execution with Coherent Dynamic Risk Measures<br>Author: Qihang Lin, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, 21 E Market Street, Iowa City, IA, 52245, United States of America, qihang-lin@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Javier Pena, Xi Chen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the problem of optimal trade execution by minimizing the coherent dynamic risk of the implementation shortfall. The large transaction is partitioned into a sequence of small trades which are further executed using limit orders. A closed form is obtained for the optimal partition and an index policy is derived for placing the limit orders.
