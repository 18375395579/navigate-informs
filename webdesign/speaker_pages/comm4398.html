Title: Weather Integrated Airspace Capacity Modeling and Optimization<br>Author: Tim Myers, Senior Analyst, Metron Aviation, 431 W Princess Anne Road, Norfolk, VA, 23517, United States of America, myers@metronaviation.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Achieving the FAA Flight Plan goals of increased capacity and reduced congestion will require an evolving understanding of existing airspace capacity and congestion issues. Research was conducted using recently-enhanced weather forecasting products to derive improved airspace capacity forecasts which were applied in a network flow model representation of the National Airspace System to optimize the routing and scheduling of aircraft under dynamic capacity and demand constraints.
