Title: Stochastic Transit Assignment with Boarding Decisions<br>Author: Mark Hickman, University of Arizona, Civil Engineering, PO Box 210072, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States of America, mhickman@email.arizona.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the current state-of-the-art in both deterministic and stochastic models for transit assignment. Recent deterministic transit assignment methods have explicitly considered passenger boarding strategies, where the passenger will decide whether to board a vehicle only when that vehicle arrives. We examine extensions of this framework to stochastic transit assignment methods.
