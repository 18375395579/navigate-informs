Edwin Romeijn, Joseph Geunes</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a class of assignment problems in which a supplier utilizes a set of distinct facilities to satisfy the demands of different customers or markets. Our model simultaneously assigns customers to each facility and determines the best utilization of resources at each facility. While resources (or capacity) can be dynamically assigned, the supplier may be restricted in the allowable capacity at each facility. We propose a Lagrangian relaxation and branch-and-price solution approach.</br>
