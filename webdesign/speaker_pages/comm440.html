Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming for Serial Multi-echelon Systems with Economies of Scale<br>Author: Diego Klabjan, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 North Mathews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, klabjan@uiuc.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The value function of a serial systems with economies of scale is very complex and the underlying policies are not structured. We present a computational study based on algorithms that combine Monte-Carlo sampling and optimization. Various approximations to the value function are discussed.
