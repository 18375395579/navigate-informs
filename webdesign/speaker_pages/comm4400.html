Title: On Applying (Optimally) to Colleges (and Jobs)<br>Author: Ryan Murphy, Research Scientist / Post Doc, Columbia University, 601 W. 115th  #42A, New York, NY, 10025, United States, rom2102@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Neil Bearden<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental results on a portfolio selection problem that maps closely onto the problem faced by students applying to colleges. The decision maker (DM) must select a subset of schools to which to apply. Each application is costly and acceptances are probabilistic. Importantly, the DM's payoff is based exclusively on the best school to which she is accepted. We find that subjects depart from the dictates of the optimal application policy in several systematic ways.
