The solution defines which pickups serve which deliveries. All pickups/deliveries can be split between an arbitrary number of ships. We assume that we have available a heterogeneous fleet of ships. Each ship can carry several commodities simultaneously. We wish to report computational results for small test cases solved by different approaches.</br>
