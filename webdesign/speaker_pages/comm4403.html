Title: Moment Relations Between Single Server and Multi-Server Queues<br>Author: Alan Scheller-Wolf, Associate Professor, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, awolf@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rein Vesilo<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Generalizing techniques of Foss and Korshunov, we relate the delay-moment behavior of FIFO multiserver queues to the delay-moment behavior of sets of independent FIFO single server queues.  This provides (i) alternate derivations of known sufficient conditions for stationary multiserver delay moments; (ii) more general necessary conditions, and; (iii) a structural interpretation underlying these moment conditions.  As such we provide intuition about why multi-server queues behave as they do.
