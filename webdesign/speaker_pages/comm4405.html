Title: Non-parametric Inventory Control with Censored Demand<br>Author: Woonghee Tim Huh, Columbia University, 500W 120th Street, MC 4704, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, th2113@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a new non-parametric algorithm for a stochastic inventory model with lost sales and censored demand, where the demand distribution is not known a priori. In the repeated newsvendor problem, we prove the convergence of our algorithm to the optimal solution, and demonstrate it numerically.
