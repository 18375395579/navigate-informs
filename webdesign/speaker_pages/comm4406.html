<br>Title: Computing Revenue Management Controls under Uncertain Capacity</br><br>Author: Gustavo Vulcano, Associate Professor, New York University, 44 West Fourth St., Suite 8-76, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, gvulcano@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alex Weil</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a RM  problem where the final capacities are uncertain while the airline takes bookings. The controller sets a virtual capacity and a bid-price for each of the resources at the beginning of the horizon, and collects revenues by accepting or rejecting requests. The effective capacity is realized at the end of the horizon and potentially not all ticketed passengers could be accomodated, leading to a penalty cost. We present a stochastic gradient algorithm to address this problem.</br>
