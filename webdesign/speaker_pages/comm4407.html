Title: Anisotropic Shortest-path for Aircraft Routing<br>Author: Joao Hespanha, Professor, University California, Santa Barbara, Frank Harold Hall, room 5157, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, United States, hespanha@ece.ucsb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Riehl<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This talk addresses the weighted anisotropic shortest-path problem on a continuous domain. The cost-weighting depends both on the instantaneous position and direction of motion.    We propose an algorithm for the computation of shortest-path that  reduces the problem to an optimization over a finite graph. This  methodology is applied to the computation of paths for aircraft that minimize the risk of being destroyed by ground defenses.
