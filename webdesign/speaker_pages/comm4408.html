<br>Title: User Equilibrium Under Operational Demand-side Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Avinash Unnikrishnan, GRA, The University of Texas, 1 University Station c1761, ECJ Hall suite 6.2, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, avinashu@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller, Steven Boyles</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A novel traffic equilibrium problem is introduced to model the effect of day-to-day demand uncertainty, in which travelers are unaware of the true travel demand before making their path choices. Basic solution properties (such as existence and uniqueness) are explored, as are basic algorithms for finding such an equilibrium.</br>
