Box 750123, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States of America, olinick@engr.smu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Network managers are reluctant to make wholesale changes to an established routing assignment; complete modification to obtain an optimal assignment is viewed as highly risky. Therefore, we consider the problem of making incremental changes to a given routing assignment to maximize throughput metric based on residual capacity. We present IP-based heuristics for this problem and empirical results showing that the incremental approach finds near-optimal results within a reasonable CPU time limit.</br>
