Title: Identifying Cost Effective Project Compression Opportunities When Activity Times are Stochastic<br>Author: Gary Mitchell, Pamplin School of Business, University of Portland, 5000 N. Willamette Boulevard, Portland, OR, 97203-5798, mitchelg@up.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Klastorin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing expected total costs in a complex project with stochastic task durations when total costs are defined by the sum of direct, indirect, and incentive costs.  We develop an effective heuristic algorithm under the assumption that task durations can be modeled by a negative exponential distribution although we later relax this assumption and show that our methodology can be applied to any general distribution. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.
