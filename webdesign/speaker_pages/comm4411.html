Mudd Building, New York, NY, 10027, United States, molvera@ieor.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Woonghee Tim Huh, Ozalp Ozer<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a peridic-review  inventory model where a portion of demand  is not observable.  We assume that both observable and unobservable  demands are stochastic with known distributions.  In each period,  the manager makes inventory replenishment and count decisions.
