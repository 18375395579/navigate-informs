The Fault Tolerance by Teaming (FTT) principle of Collaborative Control Theory appears as a promising solution, not based on the aforesaid trade-off. An FTT-inspired Resilience Framework for Supply Networks is presented and applied in two case studies; results are compared to those of traditional approaches for resilience.</br>
