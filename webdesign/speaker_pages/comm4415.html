Title: Reliability Analysis of Large-scale Wind Farms<br>Author: Young Myoung Ko, Assistant Professor, Pohang University of Science and Technology, 77, Cheongam-ro, Nam-gu, Pohang, 790-784, Korea, Republic of, youngko@postech.ac.kr<br>Coauthor(s): Eunshin Byon<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: As a large-scale wind farm with hundreds of turbines forms a new trend in wind power systems, reliability evaluation of an entire wind farm becomes important in operations decision-making. We propose a novel methodology for analyzing the stochastic behavior of wind farm reliability and show its effectiveness through numerical studies.
