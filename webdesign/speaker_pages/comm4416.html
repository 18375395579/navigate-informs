Title: Fluid Models for Overloaded Multi-class Many-server Queuing Systems with FCFS Routing<br>Author: Rishi Talreja, Columbia University, Dept. of IEOR, Rm. 313, 500 West 120th St., New York, NY, 10025, United States, rt2146@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ward Whitt<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study deterministic fluid models for overloaded queueing systems having multiple customer classes and multiple service pools, each with many servers. Customer abandonment acts to keep the system stable, yielding a proper steady-state description. We assume that customers are selected for service by newly available servers on a first-come first-serve basis among all eligible classes. We identify flow rates from customer classes to service pools in a large class of models.
