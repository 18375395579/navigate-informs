<br>Title: Fundamental Properties of Linear Loss Social Networks</br><br>Author: Mark Squillante, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, mss@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Momcilovic</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate theoretical properties of a canonical form of linear loss social networks for which maximum throughput is derived and the optimal arrival process is established. An asymptotically critical loading regime is identified such that the probability of an arbitrary loss is strictly within (0,1), delivering throughput comparable to the maximum at a low network cost.</br>
