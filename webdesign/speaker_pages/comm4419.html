Ortiz, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, oortiz@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chelsea C. White III, Alan Erera</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We model an inventory system with inaccurate counts as a partially observed Markov decision process and show that under certain conditions, a zero-memory policy that is equivalent to an optimal policy for its completely observed counterpart is adaptive. A simulation study is used to assess the value of improved inventory accuracy.</br>
