<br>Title: Equilibrium Bluffs: A Model of Rational Feints</br><br>Author: Santiago Oliveros, Assistant Professor, Haas School of Business- UC Berkeley, 545 Student Services Building #1900, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1900, United States, soliveros@haas.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study an attacker-defender game with incomplete information. The attacker can disguise her intentions and pretend to invade one location. Both players are fully rational and both play a pure strategy in equilibrium. We show that, under some conditions, there are equilibria with deception in which the attacker wastes resources to mislead the defender. We show that feints are a luxury good and that targets?natural protection and feints feasibility may be positively or negatively related.</br>
