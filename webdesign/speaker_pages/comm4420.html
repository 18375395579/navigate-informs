Title: Long Term Planning for USAF Weapon Systems, Under Deep Uncertainty<br>Author: Jonathan Klenk, Pardee RAND Graduate School, 1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, CA, 90401, United States of America, jklenk@rand.org<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: As the acquisition of aircraft for the US Combat Air Forces involves long planning horizons, the eventual demand for such aircraft is difficult to estimate given its dependency on uncertain futures. To better inform the choice of strategies to acquire new CAF aircraft and retire old ones, we formulate a problem to minimize the risk of not meeting national security demands given the random occurrence of threat scenarios over thirty years, constrained by the budget and other force parameters.
