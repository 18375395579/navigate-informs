Title: Stochastic Network Equilibrium of PEVs: Impacts of Electricity-charging Price and Speed<br>Author: Ti Zhang, University of Texas-Austin, Austin, TX, United States of America, tizhang@utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chi Xie, Travis Waller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The purpose of the research is to develop a stochastic network equilibrium model that can take into account for (i) charging cost and (ii) the charging time for BEV drivers. This research result contains initiative insights of an equilibrium route choice model for BEV motorists impacted by the charging price and speed. Two logit-based stochastic traffic assignment models are built to study the route choice behavior of BEV drivers in a network and a solution algorithm is proposed.
