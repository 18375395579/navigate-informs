Title: Price Based Adaptive Control of Duty Cycle Appliances for Regulation Service Provision<br>Author: Enes Bilgin, Boston University, 1949 Commonwealth Ave, Apt 56, Brighton, --, 02135, United States of America, enes@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Caramanis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a price-based policy to control the aggregate consumption of a collection of Duty Cycle Appliances (DCAs) in response to the Regulation Service (RS) signal brodacasted by the Independent System Operator (ISO). We develop a framework that learns the optimal pricing policy without requiring information on the current or forecasted state of specific DCAs.  Numerical results show that our model succeeds in tracking the RS signal and is resilient to changes in DCA dynamics.
