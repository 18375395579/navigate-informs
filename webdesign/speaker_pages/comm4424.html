<br>Title: Dynamic Exploration with Alternative Technologies: When to Stop Surveying and Invest</br><br>Author: Nur Sunar, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, Stanford, CA, United States of America, nsunar@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. Michael Harrison</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider an oil exploration and production company that can use  various costly technologies to survey a given site, thus reducing  uncertainty about the value of the site. Using a continuous-time  Bayesian framework, we characterize the optimal exploration policy,  and the conditions under which it is optimal to stop surveying and  invest in (or abandon) the site.</br>
