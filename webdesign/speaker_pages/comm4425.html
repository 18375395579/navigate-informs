Title: State Space Collapse in Many-Server Diffusion Limits of Parallel Server Systems<br>Author: Tolga Tezcan, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 117 Transportation Building, 104 S.

We extend the state space collapse framework of Bramson to show that a class of state space collapse results in the Halfin-Whitt many server diffusion limits of a parallel server system hold if the hydrodynamic limits of the same system satisfy certain conditions. In this talk, we  focus on the applications of our results and establish state space collapse results conjectured in the literature.
