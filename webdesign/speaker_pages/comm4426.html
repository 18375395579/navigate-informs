Title: Staffing Customer Service Web Chat Systems with General Service and Abandonment Times<br>Author: Tolga Tezcan, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States of America, tolga.tezcan@Simon.Rochester.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jiheng Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider web chat service systems with impatient customers where each agent can serve multiple customers at the same time. Customers may abandon from the queue or service. Our objective is to establish the minimum staffing levels required to attain a certain quality of service. We propose approximations for several performance measures when service and patience times have general distributions and formulate a staffing LP to identify effective staffing levels.
