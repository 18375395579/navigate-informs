Title: MaxWeight Scheduling in Stochastic Processing Networks<br>Author: Wuqin Lin, wuqin-lin@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a large class of stochastic processing networks under Maxweight scheduling policies in heavy traffic. We show that these greedy policies are asymptotically optimal for networks that have a single bottleneck resource pool. We also study the fluid model for networks with multiple bottleneck resource pools.
