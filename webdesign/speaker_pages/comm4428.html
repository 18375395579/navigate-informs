The question we investigate is whether these policies can be effectively applied to the new warehouse aisle designs, flying-V and fishbone.  We use a heuristic search to determine the turnover-based layout in a warehouse with the new aisle designs.  Our results indicate that the average travel time is reduced by applying turnover-based storage policies in the new warehouse aisle designs.</br>
