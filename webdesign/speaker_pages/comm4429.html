Hobbs</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In response to Assembly Bill 32, California is considering three types of carbon emissions trading programs: load-based, source-based, and first-seller. We formulate a market equilibrium model for each of the approaches, considering transmission limitations and emissions trading, analyze their properties, and show the equivalence of the three approaches.  The equivalence results show that load-based trading has no inherent advantage compared to other systems in terms of costs to consumers, contrary to claims elsewhere.</br>
