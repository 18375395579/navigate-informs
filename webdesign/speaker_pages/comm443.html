<br>Title: On Fluid and Diffusion Approximations for Finite Horizon Single-server Queueing Models</br><br>Author: Harsha Honnappa, University of Southern California, Electrical Engineering, Los Angeles, CA, 90291, United States of America, honnappa@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rahul Jain, Amy Ward</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a finite horizon single-server queueing model in which n customer arrival times are sampled from a given distribution F, and service times are i.i.d..  We establish that the diffusion limit for this model, as n becomes large, is a function of a Brownian motion and a Brownian Bridge process, and is specified using the directional derivative of the one-dimensional Skorokhod map.  The same diffusion limit arises for a class of conditioned “conventional?single-server queues.</br>
