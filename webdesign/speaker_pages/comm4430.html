Title: Allocation of Spares Inventory and Redundant Units Considering Fleet Expansion<br>Author: Wei Xie, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, wxie@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tongdan Jin, Haitao Liao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a spare parts inventory and redundancy allocation problem in which the product's installed base increases over time. Because the demand for spare parts is non-stationary, an adaptive inventory policy that periodically adjusts the base-stock level is developed to attain the required service level. A stochastic programming model is formulated to minimize the total cost by jointly optimizing the levels of redundancy and inventory.
