Both the cases when the investor observes the consumption basket prices and when he receives noisy observations on those are treated. We show that a modified Mutual Fund Theorem consisting of three funds holds in both cases. In the particular case when the investor has CRRA utilities, his optimal investment allocations into these funds are also the same in both cases.</br>
