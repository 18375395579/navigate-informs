<br>Title: A Fully Sequential Elimination Procedure for Indifference-Zone Ranking and Selection with Tight Bounds on Probability of Correct Selection</br><br>Author: Peter Frazier, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, School of ORIE, Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, pf98@cornell.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Existing procedures for indifference-zone (IZ) ranking and selection have loose bounds on probability of correct selection, leading them to sample more than necessary. We present BIZ (Bayes-inspired Indifference Zone), the first sequential elimination IZ procedure with tight bounds on worst-case preference-zone probability of correct selection. Tight bounds allow the procedure to produce solutions with less sampling effort.</br>
