<br>Title: Eliciting Cost-constrained Risk, Probability, or Frequency Distributions</br><br>Author: Dan Goldstein, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Regents Park, Sussex Place, London, NW, NW14SA, United Kingdom, dgoldstein@london.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Risk preferences are often elicited using pairs of two-outcome gambles. Real-world risks can come in sets much larger than pairs, and have far more than two outcomes. How to elicit preferences when choosing among vast spaces of multiple, multiple-outcome gambles? The distribution builder is a graphical tool for easily selecting one distribution from a very large space. Unlike traditional techniques, the tool enforces cost-constraints, allowing for the measurement of risk-return tradeoffs.</br>
