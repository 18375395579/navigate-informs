<br>Title: Modeling and Managing Congested Systems with Customers Sensitive to Past Delays</br><br>Author: Andrey Torzhkov, New York University, Stern School of Business, 44 West 4th Street, New York, NY, 10012, United States, atorzhko@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rene Caldentey</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a firm serving a finite population of clients responsive to observed delays. They react by adjusting their ordering frequencies. We model this system as a closed network including a service station and virtual latency stations. Routing is state-dependent as implied by the customer behavior rule. We consider fluid and diffusion large-scale approximations which suggest that all customers tend to steer with time towards a single quality state (or a pair of neighboring ones).</br>
