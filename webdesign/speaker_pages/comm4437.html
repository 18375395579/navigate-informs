Title: Flexible Isomorphism Pruning<br>Author: James Ostrowski, Lehigh University, jao204@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Linderoth, Francois Margot<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Isomorphism Pruning is an extremely powerful symmetry breaking tool  when applied to integer programs.  However, Isomorphism Pruning has  the limitation that the algorithm must use a restricted choice of  branching variables during the search.  In this talk, we show how  remove this limitation---modifying isomorphism pruning to allow for  complete flexibility in the choice of branching variable.  Computational results showing the benefit of this flexibility will be  given.
