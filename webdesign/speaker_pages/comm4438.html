<br>Title: Honorable Mention: Solving Real Life Locomotive and Fuel Service Problems</br><br>Author: Balachandran Vaidyanathan, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, vbala@ufl.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of generating fuel and service feasible routing of locomotives starting from a base fleet assignment plan which satisfies several operational and contractual constraints.  Fueling feasibility requires that every locomotive visits a service location at least once for every 1800 miles of travel.  A locomotive fleet assignment plan which does not take the fueling and servicing requirements into consideration cannot be implemented and has limited value.  Solving this problem is therefore of great value to US Railroads.</br>
