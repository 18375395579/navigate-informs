Title: Threshold Boolean Form for Probabilistically Constrained Problems with Random Technology<br>Author: Miguel Lejeune, George Washington University, 2201 G Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, mlejeune@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Kogan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We construct a partially defined Boolean function (pdBf) representing the satisfiability of a joint probabilistic constraint with random technology matrix. We extend the pdBf as a threshold Boolean tight minorant to derive a series of integer reformulations equivalent to the stochastic problem. Computational experiments will be presented.
