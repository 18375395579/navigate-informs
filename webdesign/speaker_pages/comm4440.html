Title: Overflow policies for ED patients awaiting inpatient beds<br>Author: Pengyi Shi, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, pengyishi@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jim Dai<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Emergency department (ED) patients who wait to be admitted to inpatient beds sometimes have to be overflowed to a non-primary ward after their waiting time exceeds a certain threshold. We study a two-class, two-server-pool queueing system to gain insights into the impact of overflow policies on system performance. We show analytical results for systems with two special overflow policies and discuss the impact of several factors (such as bed capacity and discharge timing) on the overflow rate.
