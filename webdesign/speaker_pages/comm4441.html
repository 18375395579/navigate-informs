We explore structural properties of solutions and specifically investigate the existence of a control limit policy to govern the balk or join decision upon arrival at a queue outside a professor’s office. We focus on developing an approximate dynamic programming scheme to obtain dynamic routing solutions to maximize the expected textbook sales.</br>
