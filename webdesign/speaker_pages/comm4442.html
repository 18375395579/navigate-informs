Title: Integrated Manufacturing and Distribution Scheduling<br>Author: Eray Cakici, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Ctr, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, ecakici@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Scott Mason, Neil Geismar, John Fowler<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate production scheduling and batch delivery in the manufacturing and distribution phases of supply chains. The scheduling problem can be modeled as either parallel machines or a flexible flowshop. Products are delivered in batches by capacitated vehicles to multiple customers. Different inventory holding costs and job priorities are taken into account. Efficient mathematical modeling and near-optimal heuristic approaches are presented for minimizing total weighted completion time.
