Title: Large Deviations for Point Processes Based on Stationary Sequences with Heavy Tails<br>Author: Henrik Hult, Associate Professor, KTH, Department of Mathematics, Stockholm, -, 10044, Sweden, hult@kth.se<br>Coauthor(s): Gennady Samorodnitksy<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A stationary sequence of random variables with regularly varying tails  is considered. The goal of this talk is to give a detailed  description of the occurrence of large values of the sequence, which may arrive in clusters. To do this a point process based on appropriately scaled points of the stationary sequence is constructed. A limiting measure, on the space of point measures on cylinders, describes the joint limiting behavior of all the large values of the sequence.
