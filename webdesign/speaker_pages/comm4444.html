The goal of this talk is to give a detailed  description of the occurrence of large values of the sequence, which may arrive in clusters. To do this a point process based on appropriately scaled points of the stationary sequence is constructed. A limiting measure, on the space of point measures on cylinders, describes the joint limiting behavior of all the large values of the sequence.</br>
