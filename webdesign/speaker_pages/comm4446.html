Title: Optimal Job Replication Policies on Homogeneous Parallel Servers<br>Author: Yusik Kim, Ph.D. student, UC Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, IEOR Department, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, ykim@newton.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rhonda Righter, Ronald Wolff<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider scheduling jobs over a system of homogeneous servers with stochastic job processing times. When job replication is allowed, we study the degree of replication that yields the best system performance under various processing time distributions.
