<br>Title: Algorithms for a Multicommodity Network Flow Problem having Node Reliability Considerations</br><br>Author: Bita Tadayon, Research Assistant, University of Florida, 406 Weil Hall, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States of America, bitanhj@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of sending a set of messages from origin to destination nodes via intermediate hubs. Given the amount of demand between each origin-destination pair, the problem is to find minimum-cost paths to transmit all messages while assuring that each message is relayed with a sufficiently large probability. This probability depends on the reliability of hubs on the message path,  and those reliabilities are functions of the amount of information flow across the hub.</br>
