We show in the air cargo revenue management section that a discrete estimator for the air cargo show-up rate can result in significant higher revenue than the Normal estimator currently used, and we develop bid prices taking into account the demand lumpiness existent in the air cargo industry. We model the air cargo capacity management problem as a perishable inventory management problem with positive lead times, and show that the optimal policy is stationary for lead times of one and two periods.</br>
