<br>Title: Multi-criteria Nurse Assignment for Chemotherapy Patients in Oncology Clinics</br><br>Author: Ayten Turkcan, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, United States of America, A.Turkcan@neu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bohui Liang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In oncology clinics, nurses with different skills are assigned to patients with different acuities to administer the chemotherapy. It is important to have a reasonable nurse workload for several reasons such as patient safety, quality of care, patient and staff satisfaction. We propose a multi-objective integer programming model with the objectives of balancing workload among nurses, and minimizing waiting time and overtime. We also propose a genetic algorithm to reduce the computation times.</br>
