<br>Title: Network Resilience against Epidemic Spread</br><br>Author: Kimon Drakopoulos, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 32 Vassar Street, 32D-640, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, kimondr@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Asuman Ozdaglar, John N.

We consider curing policies for the nodes which exploit the knowledge of the current state of the epidemic. We characterize the family of graphs for which it is possible to achieve subpolynomial extinction time and provide a policy that achieves it. Moreover we prove that for all graphs outside this family the expected extinction time is polynomial.</br>
