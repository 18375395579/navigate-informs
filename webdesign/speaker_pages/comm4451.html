Title: Optimal Queue-size Scaling in Switched Networks<br>Author: Neil Walton, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, Amsterdam, 1098 XH, Netherlands, n.s.walton@uva.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Yuan Zhong, Devavrat Shah<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a switched network with constraints on which queues may be served simultaneously; such networks have been used to effectively model input-queued switches. The scheduling policy for such a network specifies which queues to serve at any point in time, based on the current state or past history of the system. We provide a new class of online scheduling policies that achieve optimal average queue-size scaling for a class of switched networks including input-queued switches.
