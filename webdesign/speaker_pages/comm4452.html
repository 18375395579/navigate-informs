The optimization is formulated in terms of a sequence of stopping times, at which we submit market sell orders. We describe the shape of the trade and no trade regions for different price and latency assumptions. In the empirical section, we show that our policy signicantly outperforms a benchmark TWAP algorithm on US treasury bonds.</br>
