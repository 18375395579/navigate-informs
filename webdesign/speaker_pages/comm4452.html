Title: Optimal Trade Execution using Limit Order Book Information<br>Author: Rolf Waeber, Cornell University, 206 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, rw339@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sasha Stoikov<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider an asset liquidation problem at the market microstructure level, given observations of the limit order book. The optimization is formulated in terms of a sequence of stopping times, at which we submit market sell orders. We describe the shape of the trade and no trade regions for different price and latency assumptions. In the empirical section, we show that our policy signicantly outperforms a benchmark TWAP algorithm on US treasury bonds.
