Title: Stochastic Combinatorial Truckload Procurement Auctions<br>Author: Shervin AhmadBeygi, Ph.D Student, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, 48109, United States, shervin@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amy Cohn, Damian Beil, Amitabh Sinha, Richard Chen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic multi-commodity-flow formulation in order to solve the winner determination problem for combinatorial procurement auctions in which the carrier costs are uncertain. This research has implications in the areas of applied transportation planning, auction theory, and stochastic programming.
