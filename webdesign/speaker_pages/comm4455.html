Title: How Heavy Should Traffic Be? Revenue Optimization with Non-linear Delay Costs<br>Author: Ramandeep Randhawa, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 78704, United States of America, Ramandeep.Randhawa@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sunil Kumar<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the impact of non-linear delay costs on  pricing and capacity  decisions of a firm modeled as a  single- or multi-server queue. In a large market setting, we derive conditions for the system to approach heavy traffic, and the rate at which it does so. This rate is the traditional 1/Sqrt(n) only for linear delay costs. For convex costs, the optimal regime is heavier, and is one where single and multi-server systems behave identically.
