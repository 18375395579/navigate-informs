Title: Optimal Routing Policy for Taxi Queuing<br>Author: Shih-Fen Cheng, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 80 Stamford Road, Singapore, -, 178902, Singapore, sfcheng@smu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Jason Woodard, Darshan Santani<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the queuing behavior of taxis at a major international airport. Using operational data from a large taxi fleet, we estimate the optimal routing policy for drivers arriving at the airport, i.e., when to join the queue and wait for another passenger vs. leave empty. We then compare the optimal routing policy to observed driver behaviors, and explore mechanisms for improving efficiency through pricing incentives and targeted distribution of demand information.
