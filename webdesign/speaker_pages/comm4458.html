<br>Title: Bayesian Reliability Demonstration Testing of Hierarchical Systems</br><br>Author: Jian Liu, Assistant Professor, The University of Arizona, Rm 221 ENGR Building, 1127 E. James E. Rogers Way, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, jianliu@sie.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mingyang Li</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: System-level reliability demonstration testing is costly and one effective method of reducing the sample size is to construct informative prior for system reliability. This paper extends the Bayesian-based multi-level information aggregation approach to eliciting informative prior for the system. It aggregates reliability information of both prior knowledge and reliability test data available throughout the system. Numerical case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</br>
