MCP refers to a sequencing of web pages into a maximal  linear ordering according to the number of “votes?made by users  moving to a new page from a referring one, as recorded in a transition  matrix.  The approach to discover the MCP utilizes server-side,  anonymous, non-intrusive means to collect and analyze web user traffic.
