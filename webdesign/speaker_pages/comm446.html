Title: A Multi-terminal Truckload Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows in a Dynamic Context<br>Author: Hossein Zolfagharinia, Wilfrid Laurier University, 1207-125 Lincoln Road, Waterloo, ON, N2J 2N9, Canada, zolf1380@wlu.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Haughton<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a dynamic full truckload pickup and delivery problem with time windows. In this work, we explicitly address the role of terminals in designing a dispatching rule in which driving hours regulations are taken into account. We show how the model can be mathematically formulated and efficiently solved.
