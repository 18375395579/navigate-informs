Title: A Dynamic Driver Management Scheme for Less-than-Truckload Carriers<br>Author: Burak Karacik, bkaracik@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Savelsbergh, Michael Hewitt, Alan Erera<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe a scheme for the management of linehaul drivers developed for the one of the largest U.S. LTL carriers. The scheduling problems faced by transportation service providers are complicated by time-constrained vehicle operators that can be renewed only after resting. LTL driver scheduling is further complicated by the fact that trucking moves are generally not scheduled. We develop a driver dispatch scheme that combines greedy search with enumeration of time-feasible driver duties.
