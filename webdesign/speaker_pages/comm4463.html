Title: Terror Queues and the Duration of Terror Plots<br>Author: Edward Kaplan, William N and Marie A Beach Professor of Management Sciences, Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States of America, edward.kaplan@yale.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Starting with a review of US terrorism-related indictments, lower and upper bounds for the initiation date of 30 distinct Jihadi plots were identified in addition to the date of arrest or an attempted/actual terror act.  Estimated mean duration equals 9 months, while 95% of all plots are estimated to fall between 1 and 25 months.  These estimates suggest that in the United States, on average approximately three ongoing Jihadi terror plots have been active at any point in time since 9/11/2001.
