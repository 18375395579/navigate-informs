<br>Title: Pathwise Estimation of Greeks for Options with Discontinuous Payoff</br><br>Author: Nan Chen, Chinese University of Hong Kong, 709A,  William Mong Engineering Building, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong - ROC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Hong, Guangwu Liu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Estimating Greeks for options with discontinuous payoffs, such as digital options and barrier options, could be challenging when no closed forms exist. In this paper we establish analytical forms of Greeks for options with discontinuous payoffs, in terms of    conditional expectations and also propose a nonparametric method to estimate Greeks based on these analytical forms.  The method can be easily implemented and is valid for general diffusion models.</br>
