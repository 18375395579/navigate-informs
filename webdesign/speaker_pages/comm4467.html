Title: A Flow Capturing Facility Location Model for Siting Farmers Markets in an Urban Roadway Network<br>Author: Jingzi Tan, PhD Student, University of Arizona, 2525 N Los Altos Ave, Tucson, AZ, 85705, United States of America, jingzit@email.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wei-Hua Lin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Facility location flow capture model is designed to capture maximum flow based on stochastic customer demands and flexible facility capacity.  The behavior of the demand in choosing facilities in the network is incorporated into the model for capacity allocation. Two levels of coverage, the primary and the backup, are also captured in the model.
