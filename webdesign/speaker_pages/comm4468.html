Title: Inventory Planning for Low-Demand Items for a Multi-Warehouse Online Retailer<br>Author: Ping Josephine Xu, Operations Research Scientist, Amazon.com, 605 5th Avenue South, Seattle, WA, 98104, United States, pingx@amazon.com<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Graves, Russell Allgor<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: E-tailers stock many low-demand SKUs in multiple warehouses to offer an extremely wide range of selections with very fast customer service at a minimum cost.  The e-tailer manages and controls the inventory centrally: it utilizes its entire inventory, regardless of location, to serve demand.  For a given stocking plan, we model the expected transportation and inventory costs to serve demand.  We develop guidelines for stocking low-demand items across multiple warehouses.
