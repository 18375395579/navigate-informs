The e-tailer manages and controls the inventory centrally: it utilizes its entire inventory, regardless of location, to serve demand.  For a given stocking plan, we model the expected transportation and inventory costs to serve demand.  We develop guidelines for stocking low-demand items across multiple warehouses.</br>
