In our network, some customers use a join-the-shortest-queue policy when entering the network or moving to the next station.  We provide examples showing that distributional information other than mean values and tie-breaking probabilities is needed in order to characterize the stability of such systems. A byproduct of our analysis is a new method for using the fluid model of a queueing network to show non-positive recurrence of a process.</br>
