Title: On the Convergence of Joint Schemes for Online Computation and Supervised Learning<br>Author: Hao Jiang, UIUC, 117 Transportation Building, 104 S. Mathews Ave., Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, jiang23@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the development of joint schemes for learning and computation in the context of parametrized variational inequalities where the unknown parameter is learned through observations. Such a learning scheme is interlaced with a first-order gradient update method. We provide probabilistic convergence guarantees that ensure that the  resulting sequences of parameters and iterates converge to their true counterparts under varying assumptions.
