Title: Continuous-time Dynamic User Equilibrium Models with Capacitated Point Queues<br>Author: Jeff Ban, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th St, JEC 4034, CEE, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, banx@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rui Ma, Jong-Shi Pang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a differential variational inequality (DVI) formulation for the continuous-time dynamic user equilibrium problem. The formulation integrates the double queue model for capturing more realistic queue dynamics.
