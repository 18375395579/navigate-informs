Title: Exact Solution Approach for the Bilevel Assignment Problem<br>Author: Behdad Beheshti, PhD Candidate, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, beb65@pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Oleg Prokopyev<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the bilevel assignment problem in which each decision-maker (i.e., the leader and the follower) controls a subset of edges and each edge has a leader’s and a follower’s costs. The leader acts first by choosing some of his/her edges and then the follower completes the assignment process in order to construct a perfect matching. We propose a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. Preliminary computational results are encouraging.
