Title: Using Local Search to Speed Up Filtering Algorithms for Some NP-hard Constraints<br>Author: Gilles Pesant, University of Montreal, CRT, CP 6128, Quebec, Canada, pesant@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Sandrine Paroz, Philippe Galinier, Alain Hertz<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper proposes to use local search inside filtering algorithms of combinatorial structures for which achieving a desired level of consistency is too computationally expensive. Local search quickly provides supports for many variable-value pairs, thus reducing the effort required to check and potentially filter the rest of them.  The idea is demonstrated on the SomeDifferent constraint, a graph coloring substructure.
