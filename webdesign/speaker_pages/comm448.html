<br>Title: Flexible Network Design in the Presence of Random Disruption</br><br>Author: Michael Lim, PhD Student, Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, m-lim2@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Daskin, Achal Bassamboo, Sunil Chopra</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We extend the concept of chaining introduced by Jordan and Graves (1995) for designing a robust supply chain network to the case in which the links and nodes are susceptible to disruptions. We introduce the concept of fragility to quantify the change in system performance resulting from a disruption and identify network designs which minimize the fragility of a system. Analytical results for single failure cases and numerical results for multiple failure cases will be presented.</br>
