<br>Title: Average Cost Bounds for Open Queueing Networks Via LPs</br><br>Author: Mike Veatch, Department of Mathematics, Gordon College, 255 Grapevine Road, Wenham, MA, 01984, United States, mike.veatch@gordon.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The approximate LP method establishes lower bounds on optimal average cost of queueing network control problems. Numerical results are presented on the tightness of the bound when various value function approximations are used and the rate of convergence as the size of the LP increases. Comparisons with other LP bound are made using duals.</br>
