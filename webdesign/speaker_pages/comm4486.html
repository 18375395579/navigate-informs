Title: Exploring the Effects of Rating Variability in Recommender Systems<br>Author: Gediminas Adomavicius, University of Minnesota, 321 19th Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, gedas@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): YoungOk Kwon<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Many recommender systems provide recommendations based on user-specified ratings, and various techniques have been developed to correctly predict the ratings of unrated items and recommend highly-predicted items for each user.  We propose several new approaches to account for rating patterns in recommender systems.  In particular, we show how variability of ratings can affect the accuracy and coverage of recommendations, and discuss other possible applications of the proposed approaches.
