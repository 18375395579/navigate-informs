Title: Monotonicity of Lowner Operators and its Applications to Symmetric Cone Complementarity Problems<br>Author: Lingchen Kong, University of Waterloo, Department of Combinatorics and Optimiza, Waterloo, Canada, konglchen@126.com<br>Coauthor(s): Levent Tuncel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present necessary and sufficient conditions for locally Lipschitz Lowner operators to be monotone, strictly   monotone and  strongly monotone. As a by-product of our results, we extend the Mangasarian family of  NCP functions to Symmetric Cone Complementarity Problems.  This corollary also solves an open problem of Tseng from 1998.
