Title: Integrated Facility Location and Production Planning Problems<br>Author: Thomas Sharkey, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, 12180, sharkt@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edwin Romeijn, Joseph Geunes, Max Shen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider facility location problems where we must assign each customer to a facility and meet the demand of the customer through production and inventory decisions at the facility.  We discuss algorithms to solve this class of problems including an exact branch and price algorithm.  The pricing problem that arises in this branch and price algorithm takes the form of an interesting class of production planning problems with customer selection.
