Title: Pathwise Estimation of Probability Sensitivities through Terminating or Steady-state Simulation<br>Author: Guangwu Liu, Department of Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,, Clear Water Bay,, Hong Kong, China, liugw@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Hong<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Standard pathwise sensitivity estimation approach can not be applied to probability sensitivity. In this paper we design pathwise sensitivity estimators for probabilities based on a result of Hong (2007). We show that the convergence rate of the estimator is slower than square root n, and further apply importance sampling to accelerate the convergence rate to square root n. The performances of the estimators are demonstrated through several examples.
