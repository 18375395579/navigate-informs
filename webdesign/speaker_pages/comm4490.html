Title: A Method for Reliability Analysis and Optimization of Hybrid Energy Systems<br>Author: Zhigang Tian, Concordia University, 1515 Ste-Catherine Street West, Montreal, Canada, tian@ciise.concordia.ca<br>Coauthor(s): AmirAhmad Seifi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A hybrid energy system integrates renewable energy sources like wind, solar, micro-hydro and biomass, fossil fuel power generators and energy storage. In this work, we develop a method to analyze reliability of hybrid energy systems considering uncertainties and time-varying characteristics in various power sources and the demand, and to optimize the system design to minimize the system cost and improve system reliability.
