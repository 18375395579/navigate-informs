Title: Utility-Maximizing Resource Control: Diffusion Limit and Asymptotic Optimality for a Two-Bottleneck<br>Author: David D. Yao, IEOR Department Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, yao@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hengqing Ye<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a stochastic network that consists of two servers shared by two classes of jobs under heavy traffic. The real-time allocation of the service capacity among the job classes takes the form of a solution to an optimization problem that maximizes a utility function. We derive the diffusion limit of the network and establish its asymptotic optimality. It also highlights the key issues involved in multiple bottlenecks.
