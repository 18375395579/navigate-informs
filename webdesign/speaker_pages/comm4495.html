Title: Demand Response with Parameterized Supply Function Bidding<br>Author: Yunjian Xu, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Engineering Systems and Design, Singapore, Singapore, xuyunjian@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Na Li, Steven Low<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: When electricity supply and demand are  imbalanced, a certain amount of load has to be adjusted by  consumers. We seek to allocate the total amount of   load adjustment to multiple consumers so as to minimize the aggregate consumer disutility. We propose a simple market-clearing mechanism that  encourages consumers to reveal their private information by  compensating their utility losses. We show that the proposed market  mechanism yields bounded efficiency loss at a Nash equilibrium.
