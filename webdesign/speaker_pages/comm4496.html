In practice, exchange programs periodically maximize the number of transplants performed; however, the long run implications of this policy are not well understood. We analyze this issue empirically, using data from a large kidney exchange, and theoretically, with a dynamic random graph model, and find that the greedy policy (reoptimizing at every patient arrival) is as good as any batching policy.</br>
