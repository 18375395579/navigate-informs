Title: A Dynamic Model of Kidney Exchange Programs<br>Author: Ross Anderson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, rma350@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yashodhan Kanoria, David Gamarnik, Alvin Roth, Itai Ashlagi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Kidney exchange programs enable patients with living but incompatible donors to exchange kidneys. In practice, exchange programs periodically maximize the number of transplants performed; however, the long run implications of this policy are not well understood. We analyze this issue empirically, using data from a large kidney exchange, and theoretically, with a dynamic random graph model, and find that the greedy policy (reoptimizing at every patient arrival) is as good as any batching policy.
