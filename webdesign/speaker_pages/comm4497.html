<br>Title: Optimizing Mixed Load School Bus Routing</br><br>Author: Jeremy North, University of Missouri-St. Louis, College of Business Administration, St. Louis, MO, 63121, United States of America, Jeremy.w.north@mail.umsl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Campbell, William Ellegood</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: School bus routing with mixed loads of students (i.e. students for different schools are carried on the same bus) is a challenging variant of the VRP. We present a two-phase algorithm for mixed load school bus routing, where the first phase is a savings-based heuristic to form mixed load trips visiting multiple schools, and the second phase is an MIP to link trips into bus routes. Results with benchmark data sets and a rural district show improvements in the number of buses and travel distance.</br>
