We present a two-phase algorithm for mixed load school bus routing, where the first phase is a savings-based heuristic to form mixed load trips visiting multiple schools, and the second phase is an MIP to link trips into bus routes. Results with benchmark data sets and a rural district show improvements in the number of buses and travel distance.
