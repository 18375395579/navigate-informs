State College Blvd., Fullerton, CA, 92834, United States of America, tdrezner@fullerton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pawel Kalczynski, Zvi Drezner</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: An investment decision in several mutually-exclusive market areas is to be made. These models can be markets in cities around the globe or markets far enough from one another. An illustrative example problem of 20 markets with a total of 400 facilities, 4,800 potential locations for new facilities, and 5,000 demand points is optimally solved in less than 2 hours of computing time.</br>
