Title: Heuristic Approaches for the Disassemble-to-order Problem under Binomial Yields<br>Author: Karl Inderfurth, Professor, University of Magdeburg, Faculty of Economics and Management, Universitaetsplatz 2, Magdeburg, 39106, Germany, inderfurth@ww.uni-magdeburg.de<br>Coauthor(s): Sandra Transchel, Ian Langella, Stephanie Vogelgesang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In disassemble-to-order (DTO) systems it is typically assumed that yields from disassembly are either stochastically proportional (SP) or follow a binomial (BI) process. Yield misspecification results in a lower penalty if BI yield is assumed compared to SP assumption. To support BI yield modeling, heuristic approaches are developed and compared that facilitate DTO problem solving for complex real-world product structures.
