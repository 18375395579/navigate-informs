Title: Evolutionary Game and Realization Probability of Traffic User Equilibria<br>Author: Rui Ma, Research Assistant, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street, JEC 5107, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, mar2@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuegang Ban<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the realization probability of user equilibrium via investigating the day to day equilibration process of traffic flow. An evolutionary game approach is proposed and numerical results are shown.
