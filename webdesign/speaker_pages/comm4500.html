<br>Title: Probability Segmenting:  Managing Uncertainty in Military Drafts</br><br>Author: Jay Simon, Naval Postgraduate School, Defense Resources Management Institute, 699 Dyer Rd, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, jrsimon@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Lipow</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: When a nation chooses to enact a draft, this presents an interesting decision problem for those individuals eligible to be drafted: they can take actions which, at some cost, will reduce the probability of being selected.  It is in society's best interest to minimize these costly actions.  We discuss probability segmenting, the idea of randomly assigning different probabilities to different individuals, as a possible method for improving the outcome at a societal level.</br>
