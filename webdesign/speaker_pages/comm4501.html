We present an analytical framework for the assessment of alternative security systems. The problem of separating preferences among alternatives without a unique probability distribution on reward is considered. Through a novel application of linear programming and sensitivity analysis, insights are gained regarding vulnerability and priorities for information acquisition.</br>
