<br>Title: Joint Optimization of Sampling and Control of Stochastic Systems with Costly Partial Information</br><br>Author: Michael Jong Kim, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of California Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Mail Code 1777, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, kimmi@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic control problems that arise in reliability engineering typically assume that condition monitoring data provides perfect information. In this talk, we consider a system whose state information is only partially observable. The decision maker can decide when the system should be sampled, as well as when to initiate preventive maintenance. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process, and nice structural properties of the optimal policy are discussed.</br>
