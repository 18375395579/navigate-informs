<br>Title: Optimizing Urban Rail Timetable under Time-dependent Demand and Oversaturated Conditions</br><br>Author: Xuesong Zhou, University of Utah, 110 Central Campus Dr, MCE 2000, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, zhou@eng.utah.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Huimin Niu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This talk focuses on optimizing a passenger train timetable in a heavily congested urban rail corridor. Based on time-dependent, origin-to-destination trip records from an automatic fare collection system, a nonlinear optimization model is developed to capture the overall passenger delay, subject to the available fleet. Based on cumulative input-output diagrams, several solution algorithms are presented.</br>
