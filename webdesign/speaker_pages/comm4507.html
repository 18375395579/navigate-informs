Title: Distribution-Valued Heavy-Traffic Limits for the $G/GI/\infty$ Queue<br>Author: Rishi Talreja, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, rt2146@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Josh Reed<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the $G/GI/\infty$ queue under some mild restrictions on the hazard rate function of the service time distribution. The dynamics of the system are represented by a tempered-distribution-valued process that tracks the ages of all customers in the system. Using the continuous-mapping approach together with the martingale functional central limit theorem, we obtain fluid and diffusion limits for our tempered-distribution-valued process.
