<br>Title: Algorithms for Computing Optimal Clique Relaxation Structures that are Hereditary</br><br>Author: Chitra Balasubramaniam, 401 Stasney STreet, Apt 605, College Station,, TX, 77840, United States of America, bcvaidyanath@neo.tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sergiy Butenko, Baski Balasundaram, Svyatoslav Trukhanov</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Heredity is a fundamental property of cliques that is in the core of some of the most successful combinatorial algorithms for the maximum clique problem. We use this observation to develop exact algorithms for computing maximum weight hereditary clique relaxation structures, such as s-plex and s-defective clique.</br>
