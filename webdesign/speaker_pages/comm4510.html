Logen Logendran<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a tight lower bound for a group scheduling problem in hybrid flow shops where the parallel machines are unrelated. The objective of the problem is to minimize a linear combination of total weighted completion time and total weighted tardiness of jobs. The underlying assumptions include the sequence-dependent setup times and dynamic job release times. The lower bound is developed using a column generation technique and further improved with the help of a branch-and-price algorithm.
