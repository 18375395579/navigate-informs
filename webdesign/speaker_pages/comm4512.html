Title: Utility Maximization in Hidden Regime Switching Markets<br>Author: Agostino Capponi, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 315 North Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, capponi@purdue.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a regime switching market, where investors can trade a  stock, a risk-free bond, and a defaultable bond, whose price is only observed with noise. The dynamics of the instruments are driven by hidden Markov chains. We provide the HJB equations for the partially observed stochastic control problem, and demonstrate how to solve them numerically. We then illustrate the dependence of the strategies on the level of noise in market, risk aversion of the investor, and default risk.
