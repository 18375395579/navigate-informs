Title: A Model for Optimal Maintenance Policies of Multi-component Transportation System with Demand Response<br>Author: Pattharin Sarutipand, Ph.D Candidate, Northwestern University, p-sarutipand@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pablo Durango-Cohen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Optimal maintenance policies for a system of functionally interdependent components are considered. The problem is formulated as a constrained quadratic programming. The proposed model captures economic interdependencies that link the components that comprise these systems while accounting for the implications of explicitly considering the interrelationship between service level and demand of components.
