The objective is to minimize average cost by dynamically choosing which class the server should next serve.  We formulate and solve an approximating Brownian control problem with non-linear drift that incorporates the entire abandonment distribution of each customer class, and then interpret the solution as a scheduling control in the original problem.</br>
