Title: An Agent-based Model for Managing Short-Term Demand for Software Development Tasks<br>Author: Su Dong, Assistant Professor, Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, NC, United States of America, sdong@uncfsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ram Kumar, Monica Johar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We model a scenario where short-term demand for software tasks is managed by using a pool of potential workers who bid for these tasks. This pool of workers is dynamic and workers may not always bid for tasks. We illustrate how worker utility and task allocation affect software development performance.
