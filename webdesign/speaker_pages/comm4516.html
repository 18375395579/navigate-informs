<br>Title: Using Constraint Programming for Queue Design and Optimization</br><br>Author: Chris Beck, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Rd, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, jcb@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daria Terekhov</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We investigate links between queueing theory and constraint programming (CP) by solving a queueing design and optimization problem using CP. A facility with front and back room operations can hire specialized or cross-trained workers. Assuming stochastic arrival and service times, we develop a CP approach to find the smallest-cost combination of cross-trained and specialized workers satisfying constraints on the expected customer waiting time and expected number of workers in the back room.</br>
