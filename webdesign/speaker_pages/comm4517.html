Title: Probabilistic Ambulance Location Model in a Time-dependent Environment<br>Author: Pieter van den Berg, Delft University of Technology, Mekelweg 4, Delft, 2628 CD, Netherlands, P.L.vandenBerg@tudelft.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Karen Aardal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the ambulance location problem for emergency medical services (EMS). Although travel times and demand rates in general vary over the day, most ambulance location models are time-independent. We discuss a probabilistic location model with time-dependent travel times and demand rates, in which we maximize the expected coverage.
