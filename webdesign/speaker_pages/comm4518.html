Title: Managing Decentralized Resource Sharing in Multicommodity Networks under Demand Uncertainty<br>Author: Luyi Gui, The Paul Merage School of Business, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697, United States of America, luyi.gui@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Ergun<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the use of market-based exchange mechanisms to motivate and regulate capacity sharing so as to achieve the optimal overall routing efficiency in a general multi-commodity network such as a transportation or a telecommunication system. A practical challenge to do this arises from demand uncertainty. In this research, we characterize how network structure affects the robustness of the mechanism under demand uncertainty, and propose robust capacity pricing strategies accordingly.
