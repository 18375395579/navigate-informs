Title: The Speed Quality Dilemma in Large Call Centers with Heterogeneous Servers<br>Author: Amy Ward, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-0809, United States of America, amyward@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dongyuan Zhan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a call center with heterogeneous agents differentiated by their service speed and quality, where quality is measured by the percentage of callers who call back after service.  There is a natural trade-off between minimizing wait time and minimizing call-backs when routing calls.  We propose a threshold routing policy based on the diffusion control problem that arises in the Halfin-Whitt many-server limit regime.  Simulation results show our proposed policy outperforms other policies.
