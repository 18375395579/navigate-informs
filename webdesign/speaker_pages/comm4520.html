<br>Title: The Effect of Tumor Repopulation on Fractionation Schedules in Radiation Therapy</br><br>Author: Jagdish Ramakrishnan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, jagdish@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Craft, Thomas Bortfeld, Jan Unkelbach, John N. Tsitsiklis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider optimizing the fractionation schedule and the number of treatment days for radiation therapy. The tumor control probability is maximized subject to a constraint on the normal tissue complication probability. We consider both exponential and gompertzian tumor repopulation between treatment fractions in the linear-quadratic formalism. Such a framework provides insights as to which types of treatment protocols (e.g., hypo-fractionation) are beneficial for various disease sites.</br>
