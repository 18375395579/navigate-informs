Title: Customer Learning and Abandonment in Congested Systems<br>Author: John Yao, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, jyao14@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Assaf Zeevi, Costis Maglaras<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In deciding whether or not to join a queue, strategic customers need some estimate of their delay costs.  Even when queues are observable, the processing capacity of the system is rarely known to the customer.  We describe a model in which strategic customers waiting in an observable queue assess whether they should stay or abandon the system by forming real-time departure rate estimates based on their progress in the queue.
