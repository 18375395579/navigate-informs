Title: Steady State Characteristics of ALOHA with Variable Size Packets<br>Author: Predrag Jelenkovic, Associate Professor, Columbia University, 1300 S. W. Mudd, 500 West 120 Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, predrag@ee.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jian Tan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the distributional properties of packet transmission delays in a finite population ALOHA channel with variable size packets of an exponential type. Our recent work has shown that this model results in power law delays, possibly with infinite mean and variance. In this study, we further characterize this phenomenon by describing a bifurcation of the delay distribution from a single power law, after finitely many transmissions, to multiple power law distributions in steady state.
