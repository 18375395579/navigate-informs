As soon as disruptions occur in operations (e.g. routes are not available), rescheduling measures are to minimize the extent of the effects involved and reduce their timescale (e.g. search for alternative routes). This paper introduces Siemens?approach for a movement planner system. It was designed specifically for automatic train dispatching without manual intervention.</br>
