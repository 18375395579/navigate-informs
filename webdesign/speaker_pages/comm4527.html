Title: Movement Planner:  A System for Improving Network Capacity<br>Author: Melih Arpaci, Director of Engineering, Siemens Transportation Systems, Ackerstrasse 22, Braunschweig, 38122, Germany, melih.arpaci@siemens.com<br>Coauthor(s): Iris Jungherr<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Increased network velocity and an optimized traffic flow can be realized through an online Movement Planning system. As soon as disruptions occur in operations (e.g. routes are not available), rescheduling measures are to minimize the extent of the effects involved and reduce their timescale (e.g. search for alternative routes). This paper introduces Siemens?approach for a movement planner system. It was designed specifically for automatic train dispatching without manual intervention.
