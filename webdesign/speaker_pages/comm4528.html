<br>Title: A Cargo Prioritization Model for Inland Waterway Disruptions</br><br>Author: Jingjing Tong, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, United States of America, tong@uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Heather Nachtmann</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: For an ongoing project funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, we are developing a cargo prioritization model that can provide timely knowledge regarding what barges should be prioritized for offloading when the inland waterway is closed or reduced due to a disruption. Our presentation focus is the formulation of a non-linear binary integer cargo prioritization model that considers terminal capacity, barge draft, cargo value, and commodity type.</br>
