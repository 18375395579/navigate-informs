In response to this threat, we examine the problem of placing stationary monitors in a continuous space to minimize an adversary's maximum probability of evasion. We first construct a two-stage MINLP. Then, we provide an algorithm to optimally locate the monitors in a continuous space and a heuristic that achieves a near-optimal bound utilizing a discretized set of monitor locations.</br>
