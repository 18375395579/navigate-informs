<br>Title: Algorithms and Complexity of Minimum Range Clustering Partitions</br><br>Author: Dorit Hochbaum, University of California, Berkeley, Department of IE&OR, Berkeley, Ca, 94720, United States of America, hochbaum@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marjan Baghaie</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a novel criterion in clustering that seeks clusters with limited range of values that characterize each cluster's elements.  We propose a number of objective functions that employ the range and mimic known objectives based on sums of similarities.  It is demonstrated that range-based problems are in general easier, in terms of their complexity, than the analogous similarity-sum problems, thus presenting a viable alternative to existing clustering criteria,  that are NP-hard.</br>
