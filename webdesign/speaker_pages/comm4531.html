Title: Models for Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems with Multiple In-the-aisle Pick Positions<br>Author: Faraz Ramtin, University of Central Florida, 4000 Central Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL, 32816, United States of America, faraz.ramtin@knights.ucf.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Pazour<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop expected travel time models for different operating policies and physical configurations to analyze automated storage and retrieval systems with multiple in-the-aisle pick positions, which are case-level order-fulfillment technology.  We develop closed-form approximations for the case of an infinite number of pick positions that enables us to derive the optimal shape configuration that minimizes expected travel times.
