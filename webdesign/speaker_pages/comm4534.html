<br>Title: Integrated Replenishment and Inbound Transportation for High-mix Assembly Lines</br><br>Author: Erhan Kutanoglu, The University of Texas at Austin, 204 E Dean Keeton St. C2200, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, erhank@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lesley Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by an actual project, we consider designing an integrated part replenishment and inbound transportation system for a make-to-order assembly plant located away from most of their original contract suppliers. We model the problem with an integer programming formulation and solve it to determine the ordering frequencies and shipping strategies with location-based supplier grouping.</br>
