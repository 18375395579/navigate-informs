Title: Arc Routing Problems with Time-Dependent Service Costs<br>Author: Michel Gendreau, Director, CIRRELT / Univ. de Montréal, C.P. 6128, succ. Centre-ville, Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada, michelg@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study a variant of the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem, motivated by winter gritting applications, in which service costs depend upon the time at which service is performed. Our problem-solving approach first transforms the arc routing problem into an equivalent node routing problem, which is then solved by column generation.
