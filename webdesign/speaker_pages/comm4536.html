Title: Correcting Audience Externalities in Television Advertising<br>Author: Kenneth Wilbur, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive Box 90120, durham, nc, 27708, United States of America, kennethcwilbur@gmail.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We analyze the television network's problem of how to select, order, and price advertisements in order to eliminate audience externalities. We introduce the Audience Value Maximization Algorithm (AVMA), which considers many possible advertisement orderings within a dynamic programming framework with an efficient pricing mechanism. In simulations, AVMA increases audience value 4-14% relative to traditional practices, consistently finds the global optimum and runs quickly enough to implement.
