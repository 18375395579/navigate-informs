This approach dispenses with the need to assess conditional probabilities, correlation coefficients or concordance probabilities, and reduces the joint probability assessment into a one-dimensional assessment. We present the results of an experiment to elicit the contours using pairwise choices; comment on consistency, and show how to infer dependence.</br>
