<br>Title: Scheduling English Football Matches Over Holiday Periods</br><br>Author: Graham Kendall, University of Nottingham, School of Computer Science & IT, Nottingham, NO, NG9 2JB, United Kingdom, gxk@cs.nott.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In English football, each divison holds a double round robin tournaments but the scheduling for one division cannot be done in isolation, due to the constraints between them. Over the Christmas period, every team has to play two matches (one at home and one away), and the distance they travel should be minimised. We present an overview of the problem, the data collection that we have undertaken, our algotithm and the results, which show that it is possible to produce high quality schedules.</br>
