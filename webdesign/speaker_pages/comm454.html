Title: Open Location Management in Automated Storage/ Retrieval Systems<br>Author: Yugang Yu, Assistant Professor, Rotterdam School of Management, T10-38, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, 3062 PA, Netherlands, yyugang@rsm.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Rene de Koster<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper studies the management of open locations in Automated Storage/Retrieval Systems (AS/RS) by minimizing the makespan of a block of storage and retrieval jobs. We propose an effective storage area (ESA) policy that defines a part of the open locations as effective, while the others as ineffective. A model is proposed and solved optimally. Our results show that the makespan can be reduced by more than 10% by using the ESA policy compared that with NN.
