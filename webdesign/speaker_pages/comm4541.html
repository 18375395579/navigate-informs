Title: The Fobenius Number and the Unbounded Knapsack Problem<br>Author: Ping Heidi Huang, Research Scientist, Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, huang74@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas L. Morin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: For the unbounded knapsack problem, turnpike theorems specify a lower bound on optimally loading at least one unit of the best item (the one with the highest bang-for-buck ratio). They can be used for problem preprocessing. Their successive applications reduce the problem size, and thus lower the computational requirement. We consider loading not only the best but also the second best item to achieve even smaller bounds. The new theorems are based upon a classical result on the Frobenius number.
