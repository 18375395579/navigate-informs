If an inspection reveals a defect, we allow replacement to be postponed to provide a larger time window to prepare maintenance resources and increase utilization of the system’s useful life. We derive the optimal policy for a system with exponentially distributed defect arrival time and deterministic delay time. By a numerical case study we evaluate the benefits of postponement.
