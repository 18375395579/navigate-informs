Title: Disruption Management at Netherlands Railways<br>Author: Dennis Huisman, OR Consultant & Assistant Professor, Netherlands Railways & Erasmus University Rotterdam, Econometric Institute, PO Box 1738, Rotterdam, ZH, 3000DR, Netherlands, huisman@few.eur.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Leo Kroon, Gabor Maroti, Daniel Potthoff, Lars Nielsen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: On the Dutch railway network, there are about 20 disruptions per day. The infrastructure manager is responsible for modifying the timetable. However, the rolling stock circulation and the crew schedules are the responsibility of the operators, of which Netherlands Railways is the largest one. We will discuss several, recently developed, methods to re-schedule rolling stock and crew. Finally, we will show some computational experiments on real-world instances.
