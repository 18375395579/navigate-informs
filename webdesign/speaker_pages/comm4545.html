<br>Title: Approximation Algorithms for the Fixed-Hub Single Allocation Problem</br><br>Author: Dongdong Ge, Stanford Univeristy, 37 angell ct, Apt 201, stanford, 94305, United States, dongdong@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jiawei Zhang, Yinyu Ye</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: we discuss the fixed-hub single allocation problem. In the model hubs are fixed and fully connected; and each terminal node is connected to a single hub which routes all its traffic. The goal is to minimize the cost of routing the traffic in the network. This paper presents linear   programming-based algorithms that deliver both high quality solutions and a theoretical worst case bound. The algorithms are based on a new randomized rounding method, which might be of interest on its own.</br>
