<br>Title: On the Chvatal Gomory Closure of a General Convex Set</br><br>Author: Daniel Dadush, New York University, 15 Washington Pl, Apt 5N, New York, NY, 10003, United States of America, dndadush@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Juan Pablo Vielma, Santanu Dey</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We show that the Chvatal-Gomory (CG) closure of a thin & totally closed convex set is finitely generated. This extends and unifies all known results with respect to the finite generation of the CG closure.     A convex set is thin if it is contained in the Minkowski sum of its its tangent cone and a bounded set, and is totally closed if every linear projection maps it to a closed set. In particular, this class contains all compact convex sets and unbounded polyhedra.</br>
