Title: Refined Approximations for Many-server Queues in the ED+QED Regime, with Applications to Delay Announcements While Waiting<br>Author: Junfei Huang, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, junfeih@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Avishai Mandelbaum, Hanqin Zhang, Jiheng Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Motivated by delay announcement in call centers, we study many-server queues in the ED+QED regime. We propose a refined approximation, allowing the patience time distribution to be rather general. This helps one accommodate customer behavior in response to delay announcements. Our refined approximation not only accurately captures the impact of announcements on system performance, but it also provides insights on call center management - specifically via the optimal solution to the problem of (jointly) staffing servers and making announcements to customers.
