Title: Machine Maintenance and The Optimal Scheduling of Drug Therapies<br>Author: Steven Shechter, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada, steven.shechter@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, Matthew Bailey<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We begin by describing a machine maintenance problem that seeks to extend the lifetime of a system with one vital component and a finite number of iid spares.  We then extend the framework to consider a patient faced with a finite number of drug therapies which may not be identically distributed.  We discuss structural properties of the problem and a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the optimal sequencing of therapies and time to spend on each therapy.
