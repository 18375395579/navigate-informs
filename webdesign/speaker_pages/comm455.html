<br>Title: A Branch-and-price-and-cut Algorithm For Determining Branchwidth</br><br>Author: Sibel Bilge Sonuc, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, sibel.bilge@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith, Illya Hicks</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a methodology to determine branchwidth of a general graph. Our methodology exploits the relationship between branchwidth and bramble number of a graph. In contrast to prior studies, our algorithm is not specific to certain types of graphs. We use a branch-and-price-and-cut approach to find the bramble number of a given graph.</br>
