We present several possible objectives and prove that the problem can be solved via a simple dynamic programming algorithm for those objectives. We also examine the scenario where only some of the vehicles in the system are sensed by the sensors being placed. We establish a relationship between the penetration rate and the information quality obtained.</br>
