Title: Optimal Placement of Fixed-location Sensors for Traffic Reconstruction<br>Author: Ryan Herring, ryanherring@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Xuegang (Jeff) Ban, Alexandre Bayen, JD Margulici<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this paper, we examine optimal strategies for placing fixed-location sensors in order to estimate the current state of traffic. We present several possible objectives and prove that the problem can be solved via a simple dynamic programming algorithm for those objectives. We also examine the scenario where only some of the vehicles in the system are sensed by the sensors being placed. We establish a relationship between the penetration rate and the information quality obtained.
