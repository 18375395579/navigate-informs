<br>Title: Distribution Center Location for Green Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Feng Li, IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, 100193, China, lfeng@cn.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Peter Fasano, Tie Liu, Hao Zhang, Rongzeng Cao, Wei Ding</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Carbon emission is key factor for Green Supply Chain (GSC). In order to illustrate its impact on GSC's distribution center location, several mathematical models are proposed to describe the location problem and transportation mode option of GSC. IBM Watson Implosion Technology tool is used to describe them and solve them. Based on these models, we analyze the relationships among carbon emission, transportation cost, distribution center location and transportation mode options.</br>
