<br>Title: Little's Law: Statistical Analysis with Data</br><br>Author: Song-Hee Kim, Columbia University, 500 W 120th Street, New York, NY, United States of America, sk3116@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ward Whitt</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Little´s law relates limits of averages and expected values of stationary distributions, but we often consider averages from data over a finite time interval. With these empirical averages, we propose adjusted estimates to reduce bias when the system does not start and end empty. For stationary intervals, we advocate estimating confidence intervals. Data from simulations and a call center are used.</br>
