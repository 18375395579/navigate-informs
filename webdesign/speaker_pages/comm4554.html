<br>Title: Risk in Revenue Management and Dynamic Pricing</br><br>Author: Yuri Levin, Assistant Professor, School of Business, Queen's University, 143 Union Street, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada, ylevin@business.queensu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey McGill, Mikhail Nediak</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a model for optimal dynamic pricing of perishable products that incorporates a simple loss-probability risk measure that permits control of the probability that total revenues fall below a minimum acceptable level. This model is particularly appropriate for inventory clearance of high-value items, sales of single-class transportation services or hotel accommodations.</br>
