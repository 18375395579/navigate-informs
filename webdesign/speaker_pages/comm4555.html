Title: Combinatorial Auction for Multi-carrier Freight Transport<br>Author: April Kuo, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn Martin Hall, College Park, MD, United States, aprilkuo@umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elise Miller-Hooks<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a combinatorial auction of rail track capacity among multiple carriers in a spot market. The auction process is analyzed in a simulation platform, where a carrier’s bidding behavior is considered. A computationally efficient, approximate method for bid construction (i.e. for solution of the winner determination problem) is developed.
