Title: When to Use Speedup: An Examination of Intensive Care Units with Readmissions<br>Author: Carri Chan, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, Uris 410, New York, NY, United States of America, cwchan@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Galit Yom-Tov, Gabriel Escobar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: ICUs provide care for the most critical patients. When patient demand exceeds bed availability, current ICU patients may be discharged in order to accommodate more urgent patients. Such speedup can increase the likelihood of readmission to the ICU, introducing additional load on an already congested unit. We examine the extent of this phenomenon using data from 10 ICUs and examine how different speedup policies affect ICU access using a state-dependent queueing network.
