Title: Optimal Allocation Policy for Parallel Queues with a Shared Pool of Servers<br>Author: Ravi Kumar, PhD Candidate, Cornell University, School of Operations Research and Inform, 292 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, rk454@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Lewis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of how servers can be dynamically allocated in a system with parallel queues serving multiple job types. A central controller has access to a fixed number of servers and must decide how many servers to use and where to allocate their effort. The system incurs holding costs based on the number of jobs in the system and usage costs based on the number of servers utilized. We give a characterization of the optimal allocation policy.
