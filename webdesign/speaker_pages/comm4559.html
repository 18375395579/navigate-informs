Title: State-dependent Hyperbolic Discounting<br>Author: Casey Lichtendahl, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia, Darden School of Business, 100 Darden Blvd, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States of America, lichtendahlc@darden.virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yael Grushka-Cockayne, Daniel Read<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We show that background risk and state-dependent choices can accommodate the two aspects of hyperbolic discounting: decreasing impatience and time inconsistency. We apply a multiattribute utility model and find that decreasing impatience and an apparent time inconsistency can arise as a natural consequence of state-dependent dynamic choices. In addition, we show that the same dynamic-programming framework can accommodate hypobolic discounting and other phenomena.
