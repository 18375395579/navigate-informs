Title: An Improved Algorithm for a Single Machine Scheduling Problem with Delivery Coordination<br>Author: Weiya Zhong, Professor, Shanghai University, Department of Mathematics, Shanghai, 200444, China, wyzhong@shu.edu.cn<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a scheduling problem with delivery coordination where a manufacturer needs to determine a joint schedule for order processing and order delivery. Order delivery is carried out by a third party logistics provider.  The objective is to minimize total delivery cost such that all the orders are delivered  before their  due dates.  We present an algorithm with worst case ratio of 5/3, which improves the known ratio of 2 of an existing algorithm in the literature.
