Title: Approximation Algorithms for the One-Warehouse Multi-Retailer Problem<br>Author: Retsef Levi, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, BDG E53-389, 30 Wadsworth Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, retsef@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Maxim Sviridenko<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the classical one-warehouse multi-retailer inventory model with discrete and finite horizon, and with determinitic but time-dependent demands. The problem is known to be NP-Hard. We use modern linear-programming-based approximation techniques to derive approximation algorithms for the problem that have constant worst-case guarantees. That is, for each instance of the problem the solution we produce is guaranteed to be within constant times the optimal cost.
