Title: Towards a Risk Sensitivity and Dynamic Games of Multi-agent Tracking and Synchronization Design<br>Author: Khanh Pham, Senior Aerospace Engineer, Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate, 3550 Aberdeen Ave. SE, Kirtland Air Force Base, NM, 87117, United States of America, AFRL.RVSV@kirtland.af.mil<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This talk presents a class of distributed stochastic multi-agent linear systems where local interconnections among self-directed agents are supported by communication graphs and local observations. Associated with autonomous agents are finite-horizon integral-quadratic-form costs for conflict-free coordination and cohesive object tracking. Optimal rules for ordering uncertain prospects are feasible for all self-directed agents with output-feedback Nash decision making and risk-averse utilities.
