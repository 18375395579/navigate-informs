Title: Probability Modeling for Heuristics to Beam Selection in Radiotherapy<br>Author: Allen Holder, Trinity University Mathematics, One Trinity Place, San Antonio, United States, aholder@trinity.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Evan O'Dea<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Selecting optimal beams in the design of radiotherapy treatments often requires values (probabilities) to be assigned to angles.  We show that a balanced solution provides a suitable distribution and characterize when this distribution correctly estimates zero probabilities.
