Title: The Simplex Method is Strongly Polynomial for Deterministic Markov Decision Processes<br>Author: Yinyu Ye, Professor, Stanford University, Huang 308, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, yinyu-ye@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ian Post<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We prove that the simplex method with the highest gain/most-negative-reduced cost pivoting rule converges in strongly polynomial time for deterministic Markov decision processes (MDPs) regardless of the discount factor. Previously the simplex method was known to run in polynomial time only for discounted MDPs where the discount was fixed and bounded away from 1.
