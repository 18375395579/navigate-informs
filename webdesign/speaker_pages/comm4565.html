Title: Hurricane Evacuation: Origin, Route and Destination<br>Author: Vinayak Dixit, University of Central Florida, 12039 Red Ibis Lane, Apt. 1056, Orlando, Fl, 32817, United States of America, vvdixit@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Essam Radwan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Evacuation operations can be divided into three main levels: at the origin, routes and destination. At the Origin the demand dictates when to schedule evacuation orders, it also dictates the capacity required on different routes. On the routes it is crucial to determine locations for access to the contraflow lanes. This research also proposes a “Network Breathing Strategy?to improve operations at destinations. These breakthroughs will provide a framework for a real time Decision Support System.
