<br>Title: Optimal Switching Times for Season and Single Tickets in Sports and Entertainment</br><br>Author: Julie Swann, Georgia Tech, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, julie.swann@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Serhan Duran</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We focus on the Sports and Entertainment industries, where event tickets are sold exclusively as season tickets initially or as single events later in the selling horizon.  We study the optimal time to switch between the market segments dynamically as a function of the system state. We find the optimal switching is a set of thresholds that depend on the remaining inventory and time left in the horizon.  We apply the results to ticket data and identify other RM problems in the industry.</br>
