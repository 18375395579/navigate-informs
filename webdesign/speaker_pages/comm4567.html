The evacuating hospital must determine the best use of its medical staff and transport vehicles to move patients to any number of sheltering facilities. Each of these facilities has a limited capacity for accepting various levels of patient acuity. We propose an optimization model and solution algorithm that can minimize either evacuation time or cost.</br>
