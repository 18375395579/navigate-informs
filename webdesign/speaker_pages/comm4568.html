Title: Information Asymmetries in Common-value Auctions with Discrete Signals<br>Author: Vasilis Syrgkanis, PhD Student, Cornell University, Upson Hall, Dept. of Comp.Sci., Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, vasilis@cs.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Kempe, Eva Tardos<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a common-value hybrid auction among two bidders, where the highest bidder wins and pays his bid with positive probability k, and the second-highest bid with the remaining. Bidders receive asymmetric and affiliated discrete signals. We explicitly characterize the (unique) equilibrium and show that: revenue is non-increasing in k; the second-price auction equilibrium selected by taking k to 0 entails free-riding; the Linkage Principle fails even in first-price auction with binary signals.
