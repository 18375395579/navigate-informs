LeBlanc, Professor, Vanderbilt University, Owen Graduate School of Management, 401 21st Avenue South, Nashville, TN, 37203, Larry.LeBlanc@owen.vanderbilt.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Ingram Barge Company is the leading carrier on U.S. inland waterways. Barge operations are concentrated on the Mississippi, Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee rivers and on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterways. At frequent intervals, Ingram Barge must determine what barges to assign to each of a large number of customers at specified sites and time windows. I describe a linear programming assignment model implemented in Excel to determine the optimal assignment of empty barges to customer demands.</br>
