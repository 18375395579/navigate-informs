<br>Title: New Development in Searching for Markovian Particles</br><br>Author: Nedialko Dimitrov, Postdoctoral Fellow, The University of Texas at Austin, Graduate Program in Operations Research, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, ned.dimitrov@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Morton, Constantine Caramanis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the classical problem of searching for a particle moving  via a Markov chain. In particular, we consider both discrete search  effort and continuous search effort under several objective functions  including maximizing the probability of finding the particle in T time  steps and minimizing the expected time to find the particle.</br>
