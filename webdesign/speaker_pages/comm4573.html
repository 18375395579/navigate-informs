Title: Environmental Constraints in Metroplex Design<br>Author: Kostas Stefanidis, Senior Analyst, Metron Aviation, 131 Elden Street, Herndon, VA, 20170, United States of America, Stefanidis@metronaviation.com<br>Coauthor(s): Terry Thompson, Taryn Lewis<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In Metroplexes highly interdependent complex interactions exists between the arrival and departure flows of airports in close proximity. Changes to arrival and departure operations require rigorous studies of the environmental effects on the region surrounding the airport.  This paper explores the environmental (noise and emission) constraints on developing the best possible Metroplex designs.
