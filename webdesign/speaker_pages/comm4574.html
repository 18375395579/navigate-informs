Meyers, Ilya Safro</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many computational problems require synthetic networks with realistic properties.  I will introduce a novel open source package for network generation termed MUSKETEER.  It constructs new networks starting from a template, which is processed through a cycle of multiscale mappings, while receiving large perturbations to its structure. The generated replicas exhibit realistic structural, global and emergent properties, including clustering, assortativity, average distance and cascade size.</br>
