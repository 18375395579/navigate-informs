Title: Incorporating Patient, Nurse, and Agency Considerations in Home Health Care Routing<br>Author: Ashlea Bennett Milburn, Assistant Professor, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, ashlea@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jessica Spicer<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Home health routing and scheduling problems can be modeled as multi-objective optimization problems, as home health agencies are often interested in creating nurse routes that achieve a variety of goals.  We use a multi-objective tabu search heuristic to study the relationship among travel cost, nurse consistency (a measure of patient satisfaction), and balanced workload (an indicator of nurse satisfaction) objectives.  Computational results for a number of realistic scenarios are presented.
