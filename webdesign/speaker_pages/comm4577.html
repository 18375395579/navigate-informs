<br>Title: On Replacements of a Vital Component to Extend System Life using Finite Spares</br><br>Author: Gozde Icten, University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, gozdeicten@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven Shechter, Lisa Maillart</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine the problem of scheduling replacements of a vital component using a finite number of identical spare parts in a multi-state, discrete-time Markovian deterioration setting. Whenever the vital component fails, a catastrophic system failure occurs and the problem terminates. So, our objective is to maximize the total expected lifetime of the system. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process and explore the structural properties of the optimal policy.</br>
