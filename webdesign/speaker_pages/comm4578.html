We model this problem as a non-cooperative game between these units where each unit is responsible for assigning all jobs belonging to a particular unit to the other unit. The local scheduling of these jobs is defined by a coordination mechanism. We proof that there always exists a Nash equilibrium and adopt the price of anarchy as a measure.</br>
