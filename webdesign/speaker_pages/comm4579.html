Title: Fault Tolerance Analysis of Surveillance Sensor Systems<br>Author: Abhishek Shrivastava, Assistant Professor, City University of Hong Kong, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong - PRC, ashrivas@cityu.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Elif Gokce, Yu Ding<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A surveillance sensor system is a network of sensors that provides surveillance coverage to designated geographical areas. If all sensors are working properly, a well-designed surveillance system can provide adequate coverage. In reality, sensors may fail and become out-of-service. Motivated by the need to determine a surveillance sensor system’s ability of to tolerate sensor failures, we propose a fault tolerance capability measure to quantify the robustness of surveillance systems.
