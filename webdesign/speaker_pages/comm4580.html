Title: Robust Optimization in Pricing<br>Author: Aurelie Thiele, P.C. Rossin Assistant Professor, Lehigh University, 200 W. Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, aut204@lehigh.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate the impact of uncertainty and product substitution in pricing models with capacitated resources, when the underlying probabilities are not known. The approach is based on robust optimization with a novel type of constraint, which bounds the amount of the resource to be used by the uncertain component of the aggregate demand. We establish the existence of reference prices, which play a key role in understanding the impact of randomness, and present computational results.
