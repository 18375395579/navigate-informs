<br>Title: M/G/infty Polling Systems with Random Visit Times</br><br>Author: Maria Vlasiou, Research Engineer II, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, vlasiou@gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study a polling system where an infinite group of servers visits a set of queues. Each of the queues is in isolation an M/G/$\infty$-type queue. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first where such a polling system is analysed. We derive the queue lengths at polling instants, the sojourn time of a customer, and identify the policy that maximises the throughput per cycle. We conclude that additional information regarding the state of the system does not improve the optimal policy.</br>
