Title: Truthful Mechanisms for Knapsack Valuations<br>Author: Thanh Nguyen, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, t-nguyen@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rakesh Vohra, Hu Fu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider incentive compatible mechanisms for welfare maximization in combinatorial auctions when a bidder's valuation for a bundle of items is the solution to a knapsack problem. The valuations as well as the maximum total welfare are NP hard to compute. We design a near optimal, polynomial-time-computable truthful-in-expectation mechanism. We further apply this technique to a  more general and natural setting.
