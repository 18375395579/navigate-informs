Title: Dynamic Traveler Response Modeling and Robust Network Design for Seismic Risk Analysis of Tansportation<br>Author: Xuesong Zhou, Assistant Professor, University of Utah, 122 South Central Campus Dr., Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, zhou@eng.utah.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyun-chan Kim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Earthquakes could significantly impact road network capacity and further change spatial and temporal traffic demand patterns. Based on a case study in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, we first present a day-to-day demand adjustment model to capture the traveler behavior in a damaged transportation network, and then discuss how to use a robust network design tool to enhance existing infrastructure systems so as to minimize expected structural risk and post-earthquake traffic delays.
