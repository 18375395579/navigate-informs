A key element is the replacement of traditional fixed-interval, time-driven systems by reconfigurable event-driven systems better suited for asynchronous distributed environments. To achieve this, we develop event-driven mechanisms for data acquisition, sensor networking with node localization, and system level optimization that includes mobility coordination for delay tolerant networks.</br>
