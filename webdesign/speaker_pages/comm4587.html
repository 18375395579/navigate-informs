Title: Cost Allocation for Joint Replenishment Models<br>Author: Jiawei Zhang, Assistant Professor, New York University, 44 West 4 St., Suite 8-66, New York, NY, 10012, United States, jzhang@stern.nyu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the one-warehouse multiple retailer model with a submodular joint setup cost. We focus on how the cost, under an optimal power-of-two policy, should be allocated to the retailers. This question generates an interesting class of cooperative games. We prove that such cooperative games have non-empty cores. The key to our results is a strong duality theorem for the one-warehouse multiple retailer problem under power-of-two policies.
