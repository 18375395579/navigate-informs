Bookbinder<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider a shipper whose customers are sensitive to both price and delivery guarantee. For various pricing schemes and a for-hire carrier, we maximize the shipper's profit per unit time through optimal choice of consolidation cycle. We find that charging according to an order's time of arrival is not necessarily the best pricing scheme.
