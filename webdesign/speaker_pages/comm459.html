<br>Title: Balancing between Timely Access to Medical Appointments and In-clinic Waits</br><br>Author: Christos Zacharias, New York University, Stern School of Business, New York, United States of America, czachari@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mor Armony</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the joint problem of determining the panel size of a medical practice and the number of offered appointments per day, so that patients do not face long backlogs, and the medical facility is not overcrowded. We consider the two separate time scales involved in patients?access to medical care: out-of-clinic waits for an appointment and in-clinic waits to see a physician, under state dependent partial backlogging. We provide system sizing guidelines based on heavy-traffic approximations.</br>
