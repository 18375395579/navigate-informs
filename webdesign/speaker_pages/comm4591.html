Wachtel, Associate Professor, Department of Anesthesia, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, ruth-wachtel@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Franklin Dexter</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: No hospital has reported successfully implementing consensus guidelines for reduced NPO times. A patient can drink to 12 noon for surgery at 2 PM. Yet, 2 PM is the actual start time, not scheduled. For one preceding case, the start time of the next case follows a 3-parameter log normal distribution centered at the scheduled duration of the preceding case. Multiple previous cases are treated as one virtual case. Nurses access www.CaseDuration.com for distribution-free 0.05 prediction bounds.</br>
