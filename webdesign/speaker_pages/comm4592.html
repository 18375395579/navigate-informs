Title: Robust Empty Trailer Repositioning in Large-scale Transportation Networks<br>Author: Ilke Bakir, Georgia Tech, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, ilkebakir@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Erera<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a robust optimization approach for empty trailer repositioning decisions on large-scale transportation networks, based on flows on a time-expanded network, where arc flows correspond to trailer movements. It addresses the uncertainty in loaded trailer demand by using point estimates and uncertainty ranges for each loaded demand. With good robustness parameters, our approach significantly reduces the unsatisfied trailer demand, while not increasing the execution costs vastly.
