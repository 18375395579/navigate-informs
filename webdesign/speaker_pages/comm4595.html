Title: Punter Efficiency Rating<br>Author: Eric Huggins, Assistant Professor of Management, Fort Lewis College, 1000 Rim Drive, Durango, CO, 81301, United States, huggins_e@fortlewis.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop an efficiency rating system for punters similar to the passing efficiency rating for quarterbacks.  Typically, punter efficiency is simply measured by average yards per punt.  However, the length depends on where the punter starts from:  a 40 yard punt from the 50-yard line would be very good, whereas a 40 yard punt from the punter's own 20-yard line would qualify as poor.  We also consider fair catches, touchbacks, average return yards, and other statistics in the efficiency rating.
