Title: Responding to Shipment Delays<br>Author: Aditya Jain, Assistant Professor, Indian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, AP, 500032, India, Aditya_Jain@isb.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: For an inventory system with random delays in shipments, we analyze various response strategies to mitigate the risk that differ in operational flexibility and lead-time visibility. Effects of operational flexibility and lead-time visibility are studied on the optimal ordering policies and costs. While the former mitigates the adverse effect of long lead-times, the latter provides protection from the risk of lead-time uncertainty. Further, we show that these two components are complementary.
