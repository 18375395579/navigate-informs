Title: Approximations to the Average Length of Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Window Constraints<br>Author: Miguel Figliozzi, Assistant Professor, Portland State University, figliozzi@pdx.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Using asymptotic properties of vehicle routing problems and the average probability of successfully sequencing a customer with time windows a new expression to estimate VRP distances is developed. The increase in the number of routes when time constraints are added is modeled probabilistically. The approximation proposed is tested in instances with different customer spatial distributions, depot locations and number of customers.
