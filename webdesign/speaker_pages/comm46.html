Chauhan, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, satyaveer.chauhan@concordia.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anjali Awasthi, Alain Martel, Sophie D'Amours</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A roll can produce several paper products, however multiple parent rolls are used to balance the inventory holding and trim related costs. The problem becomes complex if processing capacity is limited and demand is stochastic. In this we present a mathematical programming based approach to tackle such problem.</br>
