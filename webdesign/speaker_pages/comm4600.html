Title: The Role of Compatibility in the Diffusion of Technologies in Social Networks<br>Author: Nicole Immorlica, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, Evanston, IL, United States of America, nickle@eecs.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mohammad Mahdian, Jon Kleinberg, Tom Wexler<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Competing technologies often adopt a limited amount of compatibility  with one another. We show that, in a simple model of diffusion in  social networks in which users choose between two technologies of  varying qualities, or both at an additional compatibility cost,  limited compatability may arise from purely strategic considerations:  in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction of  another, the compatibility cost must be balanced within a narrow,  intermediate range.
