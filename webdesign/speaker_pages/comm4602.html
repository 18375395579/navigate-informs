<br>Title: Predicting Corridor-level Travel Time Distributions Based on Stochastic Flow and Capacity Variations</br><br>Author: Hao Lei, Phd Student, University of Utah, 110 Central Campus Dr, MCE 2000, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, hao.lei@utah.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuesong Zhou</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This research aims to establish a point-queue based end-to-end travel time prediction method on a corridor with multiple merges and diverges. A set of analytical equations is developed to calculate the number of queued vehicles ahead of the probe vehicle and further capture many important factors affecting end-to-end travel times.</br>
