<br>Title: Limited Processor Sharing Systems: Heavy Traffic Analysis and Steady State Approximations</br><br>Author: Jiheng Zhang, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 ferst dr, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, jrz@gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by applications in computer and communication systems, we consider a processor sharing queue where the number of jobs being served is limited by K and the excess jobs wait in a buffer. We use random counting measures on the positive axis to model this  system. Our first result establishes the heavy traffic limits of the underlying measure-valued  processes, which is based on an analysis of the system in both fluid and diffusion scale. We  rigorously validate the interchange of steady state and heavy traffic approximations. The limit theorems yield explicit approximations of performance measures, such as queue length, delay  probability and response time in steady-state.</br>
