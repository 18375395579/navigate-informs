<br>Title: Statistical Analysis of Adaptive Progressively Hybrid Censored Data</br><br>Author: H. K. Tony Ng, Associate Professor, Southern Methodist University, Dept. of Statistical Science, 3225 Daniel Ave., Dallas, TX, 75275, United States of America, ngh@mail.smu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ping Shing Chan, Debasis Kundu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We will introduce a mixture of Type-I censoring and Type-II progressively censoring schemes, called adaptive progressively hybrid censoring scheme, which is useful in reliability experiments. This censoring scheme can be viewed as a design in which we are assured of getting a pre-fixed number of observed failure times for efficiency of statistical inference plus the total test time will not be too far away from an ideal time limit. Different methods for statistical inference will be discussed.</br>
