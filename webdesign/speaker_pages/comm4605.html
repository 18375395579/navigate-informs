Title: Grain Supply Chain Network Design and Logistics Planning for Reducing Post-Harvest Loss<br>Author: Yun Bai, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, United States of America, yunbai1@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seyed Mohammad Nourbakhsh<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Post-harvest loss along grain supply chains can be as high as 50% of the total value including both quality and quantity loss. The preprocessing stage and time delay during transportation and storage largely affect grain degradation. We develop a supply chain design model with multi-modal logistics, facility location, and infrastructure expansion decisions for a regional agriculture system in Brazil. Post-harvest loss is incorporated as a value discount through quality deterioration trajectory.
