Title: Stochastic Scheduling Subject to Preemptive-Repeat Breakdowns with Incomplete Information<br>Author: Xiaoqiang Cai, Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Department of SEEM, Hong Kong, China, xqcai@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Xianyi Wu, Xian Zhou<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine subject to stochastic breakdowns with incomplete information involved in the decision process. We derive optimal static and dynmaic policies represented by the posterior distributions, which are updated adaptively based on processing histories.  We highlight the sharp differences of the optimal policies between the complete and incomplete information models.
