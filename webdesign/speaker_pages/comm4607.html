<br>Title: Economic Impact of Wind Power Penetration: A Stochastic Programming Approach</br><br>Author: Juan M. Morales, Univ. Castilla - La Mancha, Electrical Engineering, Campus Universitario s/n, Ciudad Real, 13071, Spain, JuanMiguel.Morales@uclm.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antonio J. Conejo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Wind power constitutes a significant proportion of the generation mix in diverse power systems. Due to the time-dependent nature of wind power, to maintain supply reliability extra reserves are needed to cover those periods with no wind. This presentation describes a stochastic programming framework to appraise rigorously the cost of the required reserves. A detailed operations model spanning one week with hourly steps is considered. Simulation results are reported and conclusions drawn.</br>
