<br>Title: Drayage Operations Optimization for Intermodal Transportation</br><br>Author: Weiwei Chen, Operations Researcher, General Electric Global Research, 1 Research Circle, Niskayuna, NY, 12309, United States of America, chenw@ge.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leyuan Shi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The intermodal transportation combines the cost-effectiveness of rail with the flexibility of trucks. The truck portion, called drayage, is a significant component of the total cost. Drayage is concerned with the optimal movement of a set of loads between customer locations and rail ramps in a local service area. We study the optimal scheduling of drayage operations, as well as the best strategy to consider its stochastic counterpart with uncertain loads which may materialize during the day.</br>
