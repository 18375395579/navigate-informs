Title: Using Combinatorial Auction and V2I Communication to Efficiently Allocate Road Resources<br>Author: Hao Zhou, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, haozhou@umich.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We use Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) devices to implement a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) type auction to reduce congestion in a traffic network. Each vehicle need to provide their willingness-to-pay information before entering the network. Based on these information, the central controller assign a path to each vehicle, and collect toll payment from this vehicle. Our auction mechanism guarantees that 1) each vehicle report their willingness-to-pay truthfully, and 2) the overall utility of vehicles are optimized.
