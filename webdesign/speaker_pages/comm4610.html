Title: Optimal Investment of Renewable and Conventional Assets<br>Author: Wuhan Desmond Cai, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E. California Blvd., MC 305-16, Pasadena, CA, United States of America, wccai@caltech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yunjian Xu, Steven Low<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: It is expected that the costs of solar energy will be on par with conventional energy in the coming years. However, a large fraction of conventional energy costs are due to fixed assets which are amortized over at least twenty years. We study the problem of optimal investment of two fixed assets (conventional and renewable generation) where the price of renewable generation decreases over time. We characterize the optimal investment strategy and give insights on optimal cost allocation rules.
