<br>Title: A Graph Theoretic Version of the Cell Transmission Model: The Multiple Destination Case</br><br>Author: Georgios Kalafatas, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN, United States, gkalafatas@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The existence of a graph theoretic version of the cell transmission model has shown the potential of significant computational benefits for the single destination case. In order to model multiple destinations for different user classes, the FIFO property has to be “strongly?satisfied at the expense of computational complexity. The new formulation corresponds to a mixed-integer multiple destination network design problem.</br>
