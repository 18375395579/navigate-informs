Title: Heavy Traffic Approximations of Limited Processor Sharing Queues<br>Author: Jiheng Zhang, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 ferst dr, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, jrz@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bert Zwart<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Motivated by application in computer systems, we study a modification of the processor sharing queue where only a limited number of jobs can share the server at a time; excess jobs wait in a FIFO buffer. We model the system using measure valued processes and establish a heavy traffic limit, which is tractable. By validating the interchange of steady state and heavy traffic limits, we obtain approximations of various steady state quantities such as queue length and response time.
