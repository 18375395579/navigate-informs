Customers in both classes are impatient.  Our objective is to schedule waiting jobs onto available servers so as to minimize the sum of holding and abandonment costs.  We propose a control policy (which differs from Bell-Williams), and show that it is asymptotically optimal in the heavy traffic regime in Bell-Williams.</br>
