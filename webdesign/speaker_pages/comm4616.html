Title: Dynamic Scheduling of an N-System with Impatient Customers<br>Author: Amy Ward, USC, Bridge Memorial Hall, BRI 401H, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-0809, United States of America, amyward@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samim Ghamami<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a parallel server system known as an N system, in which there are two customer classes and two servers.  Customers in both classes are impatient.  Our objective is to schedule waiting jobs onto available servers so as to minimize the sum of holding and abandonment costs.  We propose a control policy (which differs from Bell-Williams), and show that it is asymptotically optimal in the heavy traffic regime in Bell-Williams.
