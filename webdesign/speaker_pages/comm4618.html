We present a set of node-based distributed algorithms which iteratively adjust local control variables so as to converge to the optimal coding subgraph and congestion control configuration. We then discuss the application of our algorithms to wireless networks where minimum-cost multicast must be achieved by jointly optimizing network coding subgraphs with power control and congestion control schemes.</br>
