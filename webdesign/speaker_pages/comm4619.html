<br>Title: Scheduling with Outsourcing</br><br>Author: Xiangtong Qi, Assistant Professor, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, HK, Hong Kong - ROC, ieemqi@ust.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Huimin Wang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a production scheduling problem where both in-house production and outsourcing can be used.  For a given set of jobs, the problem is to determine which jobs to be processed by in-house production, and which by outsourcing.  Job transportation has to be considered when the production schedule is to be made. We present algorithms for different objective functions, and discuss managerial issues for implementation.</br>
