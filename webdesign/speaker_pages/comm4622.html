Title: Impact of Technological Change on the Greenhouse Gas Marginal Abatement Cost<br>Author: Erin Baker, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts, 220 ELab, Amherst, MA, United States of America, edbaker@ecs.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Leon Clarke, Haewon Chon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Marginal abatement cost (MAC) is a crucial component when choosing a greenhouse gas stabilization target and the optimal inter-temporal emission path. Using MiniCAM integrated assessment model, we have derived MAC curves for several potential technological changes. We focus on two key attributes: the reduction in emissions absent carbon tax and whether the advanced technology MAC curve converges to or diverges from the reference MAC curve.
