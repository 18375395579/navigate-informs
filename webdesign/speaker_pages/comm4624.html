OCBA approach allocates the simulation budget to possible settings by maximizing the probability of correction selection (PCS). In this study, we use an empirical model to estimate the average waiting time. Computing budget is then allocated to settings that maximize the information matrix. It is shown that the proposed approach can achieve higher PCS than the conventional OCBA approach.</br>
