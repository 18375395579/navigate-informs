<br>Title: The Use of Optimization to Assist the FCC in a Reverse Auction to Buy Back TV Spectrum</br><br>Author: Karla Hoffman, Professor, George Mason University, Mail Stop 4A6, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, khoffman@gmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tony Coudert, Dinesh Menon, Rudy Sultana</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This reverse auction is completely voluntary and the broadcasters who do not participate or whose bids are not accepted will be repacked into the remaining reduced TV channels. Bidding options include giving up a license to broadcast over-the-air, sharing the 6-MHz channel with another station, or going from a UHF channel to a VHF channel. This talk will describe the optimization modeling that seeks to minimize the buy-back costs while satisfying interference restrictions.</br>
