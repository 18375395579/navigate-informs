Title: P, NP and the Nullstellensatz: Lower Bounds for Stable Set Infeasibility Certificates<br>Author: Susan Margulies, Graduate Student, University of California at Davis, 1 Shields Avenue, Davis, CA, 95616, United States, smargulies@ucdavis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Onn, Jesús De Loera, Jon Lee<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: When a polynomial system models a combinatorial problem, the Hilbert Nullstellensatz gives a certificate that the underlying problem is infeasible. Thus, unless P = NP, there must exist an infinite sequence of infeasible instances for which the minimal degree certificate grows. We show that the minimum-degree of a Nullstellensatz certifying the non-existence of stable set of a given size is the stability number of G. Moreover, such certificates contain at least one term per stable set in G.
