<br>Title: Stochastic Program for Setting Pushback Times in the Presence of Uncertainties</br><br>Author: John-Paul Clarke, Associate Professor, Georgia Tech, 270 Ferst Drive N.W., Atlanta, GA, 30332-0150, United States of America, johnpaul@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Su Won Bae</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: There is great uncertainty in the trajectory of an aircraft on the airport surface. Thus it is impossible to determine with certainty how a given pushback schedule will “translate?to a sequence of departures and the schedule of operations at the runway.  We determine the pushback schedule that results in the best “expected?realization of runway operations via a stochastic program in which ramp, taxiway, and terminal area uncertainties are considered along with the potential recourse actions.</br>
