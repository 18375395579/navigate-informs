Title: Simultaneous Optimization of SPC and PM Policies Under an Economic Objective<br>Author: Thomas Yeung, Assistant Professor, Department of Automation and Production, Ecole des Mines de Nantes, France, tyeung@uark.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Cassady<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We formulate a partially observable, discrete-time Markov decision process in order to obtain the near-optimal combined preventive maintenance/statistical process control policy that minimizes the costs associated with maintenance, sampling, and poor quality. We develop transition probabilities for the various states of the infinite horizon problem and a solution algorithm for finding the best policy. It is shown that in almost every case a combined PM and SPC policy is the most cost efficient.
