We are interested in large social networks graphs with millions of nodes. The objective is to place a constrained number honeypots at a subset of nodes in order to either minimize the expected time until detection or maximize  the probability of detection by a certain time. To obtain realistic problem instances we mined a database containing sampled call data from one of Asia's largest service providers.</br>
