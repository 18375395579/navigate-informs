Title: Distributed Scheduling Algorithms with Contant-Time Overhead<br>Author: Xiaojun Lin, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 465 Northwestern Avenue, West Lafayette, IN, 47907-2035, United States, linx@ecn.purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shahzada Rasool<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Recently there have been interests in developing distributed scheduling algorithms for ad hoc wireless networks that can achieve provable capacity regions.  Most of these algorithms require computation time that increases with the size of the network. In this paper, we propose a class of distributed scheduling algorithms that achieve comparable capacity regions, and that are constant-time, i.e., the time needed for computing a schedule is independent of the network size.
