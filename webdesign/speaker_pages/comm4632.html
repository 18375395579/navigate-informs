Title: Quantile-Based Deviation Measures<br>Author: Bogdan Grechuk, Ph.D. student, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, bgrechuk@stevens.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Zabarankin, Anton Molyboha<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Quantile-based deviation measures as a class of general deviation measures, defined by Rockafellar et al., have been introduced, and the main properties of this class have been studied. Under the condition of equal means for random variables to be ordered, quantile-based deviation measures have been shown to be SSD consistent. For this class of deviation measures, the classical Chebyshev's and Rao-Blackwell theorems have been generalized, and Chebyshev's inequalities have been obtained.
