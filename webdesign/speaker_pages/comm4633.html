Title: Maximum Pressure Policies for Stochastic Processing Networks with Multiple Bottlenecks<br>Author: Wuqin Lin, Northwestern University, MEDS Department, Kellogg, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, wuqin-lin@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Baris Ata, Jim Dai<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A class of open processing networks operating under the maximum pressure policy is considered in the heavy traffic regime. We prove that the diffusion-scaled queue length process for network with several bottleneck resources converges to a Semimartingale Reflecting Brownian Motion (SRBM) living in a convex cone. We also establish a state space collapse result that the queue length process can be lifted from a lower dimensional workload process, which is also an SRBM living in a convex cone.
