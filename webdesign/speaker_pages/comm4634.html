<br>Title: Automatic Control in Multistage Assembly Based-on Stream of Variation Modeling</br><br>Author: Jing Zhong, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1782 IOE Building, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, jzhong@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jian Liu, Jianjun (Jan) Shi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Applying automatic control to reduce dimensional variation in multistage assembly is complicated.  This paper presents an automatic control strategy that achieves the best quality in final product rather than in current station, and shows that under this control scheme, the precision requirement of tooling and incoming part can be relaxed.</br>
