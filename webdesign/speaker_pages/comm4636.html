The problem can be classified as follows: 1) Coordinated scheduling of steelmaking-continuous casting production and slab storage; 2) Coordinated batching scheduling of hot rolling production and slab retrieval; 3) Coordinated batching scheduling of cold rolling production and coil storage/retrieval.
