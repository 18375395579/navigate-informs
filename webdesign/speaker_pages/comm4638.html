However, some sensor geometries might provide a ‘better?fused representation than others.  We consider the following: Given a set of aerial sensors, each tracking the same moving ground target and sharing the kinematic information they sense, determine the flight pattern for the aerial sensors such that the resulting fused track of the ground target has minimal location error.</br>
