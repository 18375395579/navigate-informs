James E. Rogers Way, PO Box 210020, Tucson, AZ, 85719, United States of America, rashid@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Goldberg, Simge Kucukyavuz</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In EMS dynamic deployment, the locations of the vehicles depend on the number of idle vehicles in the system.  When a vehicle is dispatched, the remaining vehicles are moved to better cover the demand lost by the dispatched vehicle.  We further propose additional constraints to ensure that the location plans are nested in the sense that they differ by a single location from one state to the next.  We study the structure of the various formulations and develop methods to solve them effectively.</br>
