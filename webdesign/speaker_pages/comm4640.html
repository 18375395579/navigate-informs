Title: A Leader-follower Reinforcement Learning Approach to Adaptive Mechanism Design<br>Author: Kurian Tharakunnel, University of Illinois, Chicago, Information and Decision Sciences, Chicago, IL, 60523, United States, kthara1@uic.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Sparks<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider an adaptive mechanism design process in which the mechanism learns to adapt its parameters from past agent responses to maximize certain objective, while the agents learn to adapt their behavior to maximize their individual utilities. A reinforcement learning approach based on a leader-follower framework is proposed and illustrated.
