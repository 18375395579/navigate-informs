This problem has received considerable attention in the context of fluid and diffusion scalings of the network. Our goal is to determine the optimal policy and its properties in the original stochastic network, comparing these resuls with those obtained under fluid or diffusion scalings. We believe our approach can be generally applied to a broad class of scheduling problems.</br>
