Title: Equilibrium in Queues under Unknown Service Rates and Service Value<br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Associate Professor, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street Suite 550, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study queue joining equilibrium when there is uncertainty on service rates and service value. We show that equilibrium may not be a simple threshold policy, and a “sputtering equilibrium might exist. In the sputtering equilibrium, the joining behavior is non-monotone. Consumers balk from a queue at some queue length following a randomized decision, but will always join when the queue gets longer.
