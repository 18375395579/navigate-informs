Title: Design and Maintenance Optimization of Multi-state Parallel Systems<br>Author: Zhigang Tian, Assistant Professor, Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, 1515 Ste-Catherine Street West, EV-7.637, Montreal, QC, H3G 2W1, Canada, tian@ciise.concordia.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Gregory Levitin, Ming J. Zuo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The design and maintenance optimization of multi-state parallel systems is studied. The key point is technical and organizational actions can affect the state transition rates of a multi-state component, and thus affect the state distribution of the component and the availability of the system. An approach is presented to determine the optimal versions and numbers of components and the optimal set of technical and organizational actions to optimize the system cost and availability.
