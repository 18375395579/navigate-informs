Title: Scheduling a Multifunction Radar<br>Author: Philippe Baptiste, CNRS - Ecole Polytechnique, Route De Saclay, Palaiseau, France, Philippe.Baptiste@polytechnique.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Ruslan Sadykov, Emilie Winter, Bechir Tourki<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Among several other tasks, the radar of a fighter has to search, track and identify potential targets. These tasks are repeated several times in a cyclic fashion. Altogether, this defines a complex scheduling problem that impacts a lot on the quality of the radar's output. We  define a formal framework for this real time scheduling problem and we introduce several techniques to compute efficient schedules for the radar.
