These tasks are repeated several times in a cyclic fashion. Altogether, this defines a complex scheduling problem that impacts a lot on the quality of the radar's output. We  define a formal framework for this real time scheduling problem and we introduce several techniques to compute efficient schedules for the radar.</br>
