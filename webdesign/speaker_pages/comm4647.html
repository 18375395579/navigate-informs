The patients need to wait in ED or ICU until a hospital bed is assigned to them. Each type of patient has different arrival rate, average length of stay and waiting cost. The problem is formulated as an average cost dynamic program over infinite horizon. An approximation scheme to solve the dynamic programming will be presented.
