We strengthen the result of Dupuis and Williams(1994) that showed ergodicity of an SRBM  by establishing geometric ergodicity. Geometric ergodicity is also obtained for a broad family of constrained diffusions with state dependent coefficients. As consequences, we obtain finite exponential moments of the invariant measure, uniform time estimates on moments and FCLTs.</br>
