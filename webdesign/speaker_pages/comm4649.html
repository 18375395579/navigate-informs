Title: Geometry, Problem Stability, and Complexity in Convex Optimization<br>Author: Jorge Vera, Professor, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Campus San Joaquín, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, 02142, Chile, jvera@ing.puc.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Freund<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem: given only a separation oracle for a convex set S, compute a point in S.  We examine the computational complexity of this problem and its relation to the geometry of S as well as to the stability of S under perturbation/deformation.  We show that all of these three interests are inter-related in precise ways, thus showing that “stability? “complexity?and “geometry?are the same for this problem.
