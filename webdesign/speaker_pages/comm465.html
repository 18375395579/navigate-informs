Title: Dynamic Patient Scheduling for Chemotherapy<br>Author: Yasin Gocgun, Post doctoral Fellow, Sauder School of Business, Operations and Logistics Division, Sauder School of Business, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, yasin.gocgun@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Martin Puterman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a class of scheduling problems where patients arrive randomly and require appointments within a range of days that vary by patient type. These problems are motivated by our applied work in chemotherapy appointment scheduling. We formulate these problems as Markov Decision Processes and employ Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) to obtain good policies. Using simulation, we compare the ADP policies to easy-to-use heuristic decision rules under a range of scenarios.
