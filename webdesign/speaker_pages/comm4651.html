Title: Reliable Routing with Recourse in Stochastic, Time-Dependent Transportation Networks<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, sd_boyles@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A methodology and exact algorithm are presented to find an optimal routing policy when a traveler's preferences can be expressed by an arbitrary piecewise polynomial disutility function. This approach allows one to find optimal policies for a variety of attitudes towards risk, including risk-averse or risk-prone user behavior.
