Title: Outsourcing a Two-tier Service Process<br>Author: Hsiao-Hui Lee, PhD Student, Simon School, 711 University Park, Rochester, NY, 14620, United States of America, hsiao-hui.lee@simon.rochester.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edieal Pinker, Robert Shumsky<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Many service processes are constructed as a two-level system where the first level serves as a gatekeeper for the second level.   Service firms who outsource these processes must decide which part to outsource (first level, second level, or both).  We examine this outsourcing decision as well as the contract design problem, given the decision to outsource particular levels.
