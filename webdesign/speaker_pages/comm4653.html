<br>Title: A Rolling Horizon Approach for Aircraft Line Maintenance Scheduling</br><br>Author: Jorne Van den Bergh, HUBrussel, Warmoesberg 26, Brussels, Belgium, Jorne.VandenBergh@hubrussel.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erik Demeulemeester, Liesje De Boeck, Philippe De Bruecker, Jeroen Beliën</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a rolling horizon framework for an aircraft line maintenance scheduling problem. The first step consists of the creation of personnel rosters, considering the cyclic workload. In the second step, a robust maintenance base schedule is developed by taking into account the delay distributions. The third step consists of the rolling horizon algorithm where the flight delays are simulated and the maintenance base schedule is adjusted.</br>
