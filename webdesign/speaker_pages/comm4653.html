The first step consists of the creation of personnel rosters, considering the cyclic workload. In the second step, a robust maintenance base schedule is developed by taking into account the delay distributions. The third step consists of the rolling horizon algorithm where the flight delays are simulated and the maintenance base schedule is adjusted.
