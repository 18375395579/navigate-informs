The model considers an aircraft’s trajectory in 3D space and represents the aircraft by a symmetrical ellipsoid with the axis of symmetry directing the trajectory. Analytical and discrete optimization approaches for routing an aircraft with variable radar cross-section subject to a constraint on the trajectory length have been developed.</br>
