Title: Quality vs. Speed: The Waiting/ Service Time Conundrum<br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Krishnan Anand, Mehmet Pac<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We model a service system where the expected service quality  changes with service speed. Increasing the service rate reduces the waiting costs, but also reduces the expected service quality, so slow service might provide better service. An arriving customer decides whether to join a service based on its value, speed of service and his expected waiting costs. We find firms might charge higher or lower price for better service based on rate of value degradation.
