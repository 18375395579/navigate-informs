Title: Approximating Equilibria in Sequential Auctions<br>Author: Eric Sodomka, PhD Candidate, Brown University, 115 Waterman Street, 4th Floor, Providence, RI, United States of America, sodomka@cs.brown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amy Greenwald, Jiacui Li<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We search for symmetric equilibria in sequential auctions by modeling the bidder's problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and searching for stable transition probabilities, given bidder MDP policies. We quantify how approximately optimizing with respect to approximately stable transition probabilities corresponds to approximate equilibria. We converge to known equilibria for simpler problems and find new approximate equilibria for problems where analytical solutions are unknown.
