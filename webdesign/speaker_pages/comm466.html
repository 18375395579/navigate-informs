Title: Dynamic Activity-Travel Networks: A Framework to Model Transportation Demand-Supply Interactions<br>Author: Gitakrishnan Ramadurai, Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, ramadg@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A new network representation framework, Activity-Travel Networks, is proposed where nodes are activity centers that are joined by travel links. Activities are represented by arcs that originate and terminate in same node. Each individual chooses an activity-travel sequence that maximizes his/her utility. A dynamic equilibrium is reached when all users have identified their ‘best?activity-travel sequence and any unilateral change results in reduction in one’s utility.
