Title: Two-stage Portfolio Optimization with Higher-order Conditional Measures of Risk<br>Author: Sitki Gulten, Ph.D Candidate, Rutgers University, Department of Management Science & Infor, 1 Washington Park, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, sgulten@rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrzej Ruszczynski<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Optimization of a portfolio with an option to rebalance over multiple periods from is a major problem in modern portfolio theory. In this research, different forward and backward scenario tree generation techniques are applied on multivariate GARCH-generated scenarios to construct scenario trees. Next, mean-semideviation risk function with higher-orders is used to formulate the two-stage portfolio problem in which there are two periods and an option to rebalance between those two periods.
