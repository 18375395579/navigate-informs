<br>Title: Neighborly Measures for Sampling Independent Sets</br><br>Author: David Goldberg, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, dgoldberg9@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a family of measures which generalizes the well-known hardcore model for sampling the independent sets (i.s.) of a graph.  In our model, the probability assigned to a given i.s. depends not only on its cardinality, but also on how many excluded nodes are adjacent to exactly k nodes belonging to the i.s. for each k.  We give tight conditions for correlation decay in the infinite regular tree under a log-convexity assumption, and gain further insight through a perturbative analysis.</br>
