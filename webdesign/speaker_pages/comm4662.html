<br>Title: Decentralized Optimization and Correlation Decay</br><br>Author: Theophane Weber, MIT Operations Research Center, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-131, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, theo_w@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Gamarnik, John Tsitsiklis</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consider a network of cooperating agents, each of which has to take a one-shot decision. All agents seek to optimize a global function decomposable as a sum of edge functions, where the value of each depends on the decisions  at the endpoints.  Is it possible for agents who know the network within a distance r to compute a decentralized decision? How is performance affected by the distance r? We look at these questions using a correlation decay technique in an average-case probabilistic setting.</br>
