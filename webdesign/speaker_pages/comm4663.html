<br>Title: Market Outsourcing Practices of Major US Carriers</br><br>Author: Brendan Hogan, Sr. Simulation Modeling Engineer, MITRE/CAASD and U. of Virginia, 7515 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA, 22102, United States, bhogan@mitre.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dipasis Bhadra</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In the US airline industry, major carriers partner with lower cost regional carriers to serve some markets on their behalf in order to better meet business objectives.  However, mainline carriers have reduced their costs significantly over the past couple years, changing the dynamic of what markets they can profitably serve themselves.  This work is an attempt to quantify the key determinants of markets that are flown by mainline carriers versus being outsourced to regionals.</br>
