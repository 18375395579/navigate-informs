Title: A POMDP for Maintenance Optimization with a Heterogeneous Population of Spare Components<br>Author: C.D van Oosterom, PhD student, Eindhoven University of Technology, P.O. Box 513, Opwettensemolen 62, Eindhoven, 5600MB, Netherlands, C.D.v.Oosterom@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Geert-Jan van Houtum, Hao Peng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model that incorporates component heterogeneity in adaptively scheduling inspections and replacements for deteriorating systems. As the likelihood of observing a certain sequence of degradation levels will be affected by the component type (strong or weak), inspections and replacements can be adapted to the belief about the component type. We evaluate the according reduction in total expected discounted costs in a numerical study.
