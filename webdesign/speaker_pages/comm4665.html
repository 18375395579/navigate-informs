Title: Crashing Options in Stochastic Serial Networks<br>Author: Karolina Glowacka, University of Pittsburgh, Katz Graduate School of Business, 343 Mervis, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States, kaglowacka@katz.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Richard Wendell<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper we consider how to optimally exercise crashing options in stochastic project networks. First, for the important special case of serial networks we present theoretical properties as well as solution methods and computational results. Then we examine how these results can be extended to more general networks.
