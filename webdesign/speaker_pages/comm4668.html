Title: Mean and Variance Control of Dynamic Rate Multiserver Queues with Abandonment<br>Author: Jamol Pender, Graduate Student, Princeton University, Sherrerd Hall Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, United States of America, jpender@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Massey<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We derive the optimal staffing schedule for a dynamic rate multi-server queue with abandonment where we want our profit to have a minimal amount of risk. To this end we consider optimal staffing of our multiserver queue with the fluid mean, but also the diffusion variance. Our analysis yields that the optimal staffing level is the solution to a fixed point equation. We also compare our staffing schedule to more well known staffing procedures such as square root staffing.
