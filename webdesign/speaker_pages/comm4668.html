To this end we consider optimal staffing of our multiserver queue with the fluid mean, but also the diffusion variance. Our analysis yields that the optimal staffing level is the solution to a fixed point equation. We also compare our staffing schedule to more well known staffing procedures such as square root staffing.</br>
