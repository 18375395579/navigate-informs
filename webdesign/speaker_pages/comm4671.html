Title: Dynamic Inventory Replenishment Decisions with Bayesian Learning of Supply Yield Uncertainty<br>Author: Baykal Hafizoglu, Arizona State University, 699 S Mill Avenue, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, baykal@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sibel Salman, Esma Gel<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a periodic-review inventory replenishment problem with yield uncertainty, where the quantity that the supplier ships in response to an order is random. We assume that the parameters that govern the supplier’s yield are not known with certainty in advance. We propose a Bayesian updating scheme that learns supplier's yield parameters over time. We compare performance of Bayesian learning scheme with other strategies such as safety stock policy, and simple heuristics.
