<br>Title: Determining the Optimal Preventive Maintenance Age under Uncertainty in the Lifetime Distribution</br><br>Author: Bram de Jonge, University of Groningen, Faculty of Economics and Business,, Dept. of Operations, P.O. Box 800, Groningen, 9700AV, Netherlands, B.de.Jonge@rug.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Warse Klingenberg, Ruud Teunter, Tiedo Tinga</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The problem of determining the optimal maintenance age of a component given its lifetime distribution has been studied extensively. However, in practice, this lifetime distribution is not known with certainty. The uncertainty in the lifetime distribution is of interest because it influences the optimal maintenance age, implying that taking into account this uncertainty results in lower expected costs. We study the effect of uncertainty in the lifetime distribution on the optimal maintenance age.</br>
