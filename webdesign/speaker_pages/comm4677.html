Title: Continuous Multi-hypotheses Testing with Resource Constraints<br>Author: Ankit Jain, UC Berkeley, 1945 Berkeley Way Apt 327, Berkeley, CA, 94704, United States of America, ankit@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cathy H. Xia, Parijat Dube, Zhen Liu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the problem of efficient resource allocation to answer multiple independent queries in information systems such as sensor networks or traffic monitoring. Presence of continuous streams of data and dynamic environment requires a real time resource allocation mechanism to get information as quickly as possible. We use continuous time control to show for common inference models, the problem reduces to multiple arm bandit and a myopic policy is optimal. We provide bounds for other cases.
