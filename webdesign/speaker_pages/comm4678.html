Title: Admission Policies for Walk-in Patients at a Diagnostic Center<br>Author: Nomesh Bolia, United States of America, nomesh@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Vidyadhar Kulkarni<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a diagnostic center with scheduled and walk-in patients where the former may not show up with some probability. The center therefore admits some walk-ins and has to decide whether to admit a given walk-in patient. The only waiting cost is a terminal cost for patients not served by the end of the day. Using dynamic programming, we prove the optimality of a switching curve for the admission policy. We also develop a heuristic that is easier to implement and performs well.
