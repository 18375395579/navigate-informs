<br>Title: Feedforward Control of Multistation Assembly Processes Using Reconfigurable Fixtures</br><br>Author: Luis E. Izquierdo, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Michigan, Mechanical Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, leiv@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jianjun Shi, S. Jack Hu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The use of feedforward control in multistation manufacturing systems has emerged as a promissory method to reduce product variation. Using process adjustment to compensate deviations in a part-by-part basis, final product quality can be significantly improved. This talk addresses the problem of designing a feedforward control strategy that considers: deviations estimation (from in-line measurements), process/parts constraints and variation propagation on determining the optimal control action.</br>
