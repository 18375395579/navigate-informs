Title: Data-Driven Convex Optimization with Applications to Supply Chain Management<br>Author: Paat Rusmevichientong, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, 221 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States, paatrus@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): W. Tim Huh<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study non-parametric stochastic inventory planning systems with lost sales and censored demand under stationary and non-stationary settings. We propose adaptive inventory policies that generate a sequence of ordering decisions over time. The decision in each period depends only on historical sales data of the past. Our adaptive algorithms converge to the optimal, and the average expected cost during the first T periods differs from the optimal cost by at most O( 1 / \sqrt{T} ).
