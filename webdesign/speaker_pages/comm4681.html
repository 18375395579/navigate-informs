<br>Title: Exact and Heuristic Solution Algorithms for Real-time Multi-purpose Trip Optimization in LBS</br><br>Author: T. John Kim, Endowed Professor of Urban & Regional Systems, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Dept of Urban & Regional Planning, 111 Temple Buell Hall, 611 Taft Drive, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, tjohnkim@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seungmo Kang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A new type of Location-Based Services (LBS) is to guide users with a route and locations of multiple point-of-interests to visit with minimum cost including the purchasing, stopping, and travel costs. For a real-time application, we developed dynamic programming methods. Heuristic solution algorithms are also applied where exact solutions exceed the time limit.</br>
