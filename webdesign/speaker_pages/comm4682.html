Title: The Contingent Routing Problem: Exact Algorithms and Heuristics<br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, C1761, ECJ 6.202, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): N. Nezamuddin, Travis Waller<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Practical use of online routing algorithms often requires a limitation on the number of alternatives presented to a user. Several approaches are given for the problems of deciding where re-routing information should be given, and which routes are recommended, given a constraint on the total number of options which can be provided.
