Title: Dynamic Realization Games in Newsvendor Inventory Centralization<br>Author: Moshe Dror, Professor, University of Arizona, MIS, Eller College of Management, Tucson, AZ 85721, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, mdror@eller.arizona.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ana Meca, Luis Guardiola, Justo Puerto<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider a newsvendor centralization game. When holding and penalty costs are identical for all subsets, the game has a non empty core. We examine a related game based on demand realizations. Based on Lehrer (2002) we propose a repeated cost allocation scheme. We prove that the cost allocation processes converge a.s. to either a least square value or the core of the expected game. We also extend the results to a more general class of dynamic cost games.
