Title: An Adaptive Algorithm for Finding the Optimal Base-stock Policy in Lost Sales Inventory Systems<br>Author: Paat Rusmevichientong, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, 221 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, paatrus@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ganesh Janakiraman, John Muckstadt, Woonghee Tim Huh<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the problem of finding the best base stock policy in an inventory system with lost sales and positive replenishment lead times.  In our model, the demand distribution is not known a priori and the manager must make the replenishment decision in each period based only on the past sales (censored demand) data. We develop a nonparametric adaptive algorithm that generates a sequence of order-up-to levels whose running average cost converges to the cost of the optimal base-stock policy.
