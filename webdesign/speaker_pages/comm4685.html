The model (1) guides evacuees through a “pedestrian network?of streets and crosswalks to designated pick-up points and (2) routes a fleet of buses on a “vehicular network?from depots to pick-up points in order to transport evacuees to shelter areas. A heuristic method is developed to solve large-scale problem instances in a reasonable amount of time.</br>
