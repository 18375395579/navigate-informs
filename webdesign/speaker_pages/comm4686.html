Title: An FPTAS For Dynamic Pricing with Learning<br>Author: Vivek Farias, Assistant Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management, 30 Wadsworth Street, E53-317, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, vivekf@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James Orlin, Georgia Perakis, Retsef Levi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a discrete variant of a classical model of dynamic pricing with learning under uncertain demand that arises in the context of many retailer operations. The problem can be cast as a dynamic program with an intractable state-space. We identify a state-space collapse that along with a novel truncation scheme allows us to develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for this problem.
