Title: Using Cross-entropy for Solving the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem<br>Author: Adji Cisse<br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Matis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this presentation, we show how Cross-Entropy methods may be used to find the stochastic shortest path through a networks.  At the core of this approach is the use of truncated saddlepoint approximations for the distribution of path lengths.
