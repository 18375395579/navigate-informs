Title: Robust Fixture Layout Design with Consideration of Datum Features Uncertainty<br>Author: Jianjun (Jan) Shi, Professor, U. of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, IOE 1784, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, shihang@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin, Jian Liu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Dimensional variations of datum features will lead to improper location of parts and subassemblies. This research develops a methodology to achieve robust fixture layout design for multistage manufacturing processes, which considers the datum features uncertainty to consistently provide the best performance.  A robust design methodology and case study are presented.
