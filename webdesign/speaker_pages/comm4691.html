<br>Title: Queue Decomposition and its Applications in State-dependent Queues</br><br>Author: Hossein Abouee Mehrizi, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, Canada, haboueemehrizi@uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Opher Baron</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A main idea in the analysis of Markovian queueing systems is that at each point in time the system can be decomposed into two systems: in one system there are n or less people and in the other one there are n+1 or more people. We consider an M_n/G_n/1 state-dependent single server queue and show that our state-dependent queueing system is equivalent to a Markovian birth-and-death process. We discuss several service and inventory problems that can be modeled as a state-dependent queueing system.</br>
