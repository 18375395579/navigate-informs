Title: Designing Electric Power Grids to Minimize Cascading Blackouts<br>Author: Eric Anderson, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI, United States of America, eanderson4@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Linderoth<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: If an exogenous event impacts the topology or operating characteristics of an electric power grid, the currents reroute themselves according to the laws of physics. The change in flows may result in power lines reaching capacity, overloading, and eventually failing, further weakening the system. A sequence of failures in stages is known as a cascade. A multi-stage stochastic program with decision dependent uncertainty and a simulation-based-optimization approach will be discussed.
