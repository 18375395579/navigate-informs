Title: Propagating Separable Equalities in a MDD Store<br>Author: John Hooker, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, john@hooker.tepper.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tarik Hadzic, Peter Tiedemann<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a propagator that achieves MDD consistency for  a separable equality over an MDD (multivalued decision diagram) store  in pseudo-polynomial time. We integrate the propagator into a constraint solver based on an MDD store. Our experiments show  that the new propagator provides substantial computational advantage  over propagation of two inequality constraints, and that the advantage  increases when the maximum width of the MDD store increases.
