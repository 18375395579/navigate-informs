Title: Making use of Dual Sourcing to Reduce Carbon Emissions in Transport<br>Author: Tarkan Tan, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Pav F-7, Eindhoven, 5612AZ, Netherlands, T.Tan@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Kristel Hoen, Geert-Jan van Houtum, Jan Fransoo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a carbon-aware company that orders several products from suppliers, which can be fulfilled via a fast or a slow channel. We study a multi-item dual-sourcing problem subject to an emission constraint. We use a single-index order policy that specifies two order-up-to levels and we find solutions for the multi-item setting that meet the emission constraint. Making use of actual emission figures, we elaborate on factors that determine when significant emission reductions can be achieved.
