Each series is analyzed spatially and temporally in order to identify patterns in (1) static factors such as location, time of day, and day of the week and (2) dynamic factors such as the time between events, distance between events, and movement pattern.  We demonstrate how these novel techniques have been tremendously successful in forecasting the location and timing of insurgent attacks in Iraq.</br>
