Given bid landscapes that are typically provided by some ad-serving systems, we formulate the problem and optimize the profit given budget constraints. We consider bidding strategies that consist of no more than k different bids for all the keywords. We present a PTAS when k is constant and constant-factor approximation otherwise.</br>
