Title: Partial Flexibility in Routing and Scheduling<br>Author: Rhonda Righter, Professor, University of California-Berkeley, IEOR Dept., Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, rrighter@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Osman Akgun, Ronald Wolff<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Some customers are dedicated to a specific server and some are flexible. We give conditions for the optimality of Dedicated Customers First (DCF) for scheduling, and Join the Smallest Work (JSW) or Join the Shortest Queue (JSQ) for routing of flexible customers. We compare these policies in terms of both efficiency and fairness, and argue that the overall best approach for call centers is JSW routing.  We show how this can be implemented in call centers even when work is unknown.
