Title: Algorithms for Leveraging a Flexible Workforce in Automotive Planning<br>Author: Ada Barlatt, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, abarlatt@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Craig Morford, Oleg Gusikhin, Amy Cohn, Yakov Fradkin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of simultaneously deciding the workforce size and allocation of laborers in a facility.  We present an example from automotive stamping to illustrate a new algorithm, Test-and-Prune, which ensures tractability, and  discuss how this approach extends to other hierarchical planning problems.
