Title: Two Dimensional Load Balancing<br>Author: Kangbok Lee, Research Associate Professor, Rutgers University, Business School, Piscataway, NJ, United States of America, kangblee@business.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Leung, Michael Pinedo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a bi-criteria parallel machine scheduling problem in which the first objective is to minimize the makespan of the schedule and the second objective is to minimize the maximum machine cost. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, we propose a fast heuristic and derive its worst-case performance bound.
