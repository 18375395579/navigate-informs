Title: The Generalized Location Routing Problem with Profits<br>Author: Diego Klabjan, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, Ind. Eng. and Mgmt. Sci., d-klabjan@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jaemyung Ahn, Olivier de Weck<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In exploring the surface of a planetary body, a unique routing problem is encountered. It considers profits at sites and resource consumption along routes depends on the selected strategy. We solve the underlying model by branch-and-price. In addition, a novel problem specific heuristic is developed.
