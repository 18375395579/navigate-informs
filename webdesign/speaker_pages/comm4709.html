<br>Title: Air Marshals Scheduling Problem</br><br>Author: Xiaofeng Nie, University at Buffalo (SUNY), 438 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, xnie2@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rajan Batta, Colin Drury, Li Lin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a two-level formulation where flights are classified into several risk levels. The first level relates to TSA who will decide which flights from each risk level to be covered and construct the air marshals pairings such that the expected exposure is minimized. The second level relates to a threat source who will decide the probability of attaching one flight from each risk level with two objectives: maximizing the expected exposure and minimizing probability of apprehension.</br>
