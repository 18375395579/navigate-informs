<br>Title: How Learning and Forgetting Affect the Optimal Work Allocation Policy</br><br>Author: Geoff Ryder, Ph.D. Candidate, University of California - Santa Cruz, 4190 Sophia Way, San Jose, CA, 95134, United States, gryder@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Ross</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Service systems often require agents to divide their time between different job functions, and their effective service level for each function changes with experience. We analyze optimal work allocation policies where an agent's efficiency for a job class may increase through experience (learning-by-doing), or decrease due to forgetting (rapidly changing requirements). Policies vary between service-dominated (eg. serve at maximum available rate) and delay-  dominated (serve the longest queue).</br>
