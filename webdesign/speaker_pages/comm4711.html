Title: Demand Based Robust Aircraft Routing<br>Author: Sergey Shebalov, Senior Programmer Analyst, United Airlines, 1360 S. Elmhurst, #202, Mount Prospect, IL, 60056, United States, Sergey.Shebalov@united.com<br>Coauthor(s): Diego Klabjan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Recently, the problem of adjusting capacities late in the booking process to better match observed passenger demand acquired a lot of attention. We address this problem by developing robust aircraft routes, which maximize the number of aircraft swapping opportunities from crew-compatible fleets. We can interpret our approach as providing robustness with respect to passenger demand.
