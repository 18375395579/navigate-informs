Each agent receives a signal about an underlying time-varying state and communicates with a subset of agents (his neighbors). We consider the rule of thumb learning rules whereby each agent constructs his posterior as a weighted average of his prior, his signal and the information he receives from neighbors. Our main results characterize the convergence behavior of beliefs.</br>
