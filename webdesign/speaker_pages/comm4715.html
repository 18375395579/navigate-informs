Title: A Behavioral Model to Understand the Qualitative Attributes in Freight Contracts<br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sukkusur@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rodrigo Mesa-Arango<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Previous research shows that shippers do not always select the cheapest option when assigning contracts to carriers. Thus, shippers deny some cost savings by selecting carriers with attributes for which they are willing to pay more. This research applies a survey over a sample of shippers and uses econometric modeling to determine the monetary values that the shipper perceive for several attributes of the carriers.
