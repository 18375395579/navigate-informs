Title: Risk Taking over Networks: Insufficient Precautions<br>Author: Azarakhsh Malekian, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave,  32D-632, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, azarakhsh.malekian@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Asuman Ozdaglar, Daron Acemoglu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We introduce a theoretical model of the security investments in a network of interconnected agents and characterize the impact of network structure on equilibrium and optimal investments. We also show that when the attack location is endogenized, there is an additional incentive for overinvestment: greater investment by an agent shifts the attack to other parts of the network.
