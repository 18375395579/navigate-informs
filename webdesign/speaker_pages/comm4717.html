<br>Title: Queueing Models for a Single Machine Subject to Multiple Types of Interruptions</br><br>Author: Kan Wu, Assistant Professor, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Ave, School of MAE, Singapore, 639798, Singapore, kan626@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leon McGinnis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Queueing models are commonly applied to quantify the performance of production systems. Prior research usually focuses on deriving queueing models for a specific type of interruptions. However, machines generally suffer multiple types of interruptions in practical manufacturing systems. To satisfy this need, an integrated model is proposed, in which multiple types of interruptions commonly seen on the shop floors are considered.</br>
