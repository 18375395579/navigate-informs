Title: Optimal Policy for Expediting Under Stochastic Lead Time and Demand<br>Author: Chiwon Kim, Ph.D. Student, MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Building 1-151, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, chiwon@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi, Diego Klabjan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a single item periodic review inventory problem, where regular delivery lead time is stochastic. RFID is used to get information on the distribution of outstanding orders in the pipeline and the outstanding orders can be expedited instantaneously to the final stage according to demand situation that is also stochastic. We find the optimal expediting and regular ordering policy under a certain assumption on expediting cost structure.
