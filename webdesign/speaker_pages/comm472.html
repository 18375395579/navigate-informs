Title: Utilization of Hydroelectric Dams for Wind Integration<br>Author: Seth Blumsack, Associate Professor, Pennsylvania State University, John and Willie Leone Family Department, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, sethb@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Reed, Alisha Fernandez<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We model the decision of a multi-use hydroelectric dam to provide wind integration services, scheduled energy production and ecosystem services through controlled releases. Even if wind integration services are priced substantially higher than current ancillary services, multi-use dams face operational constraints in providing wind integration services. These operational constraints are exacerbated during periods of drought.
