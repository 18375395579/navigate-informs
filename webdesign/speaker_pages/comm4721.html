It is often the case that these phases are carried out by the same medical provider.  We consider the question of how to prioritize the work by the provider to balance initial delays for care with the need to discharge patients in a timely fashion.  We present a single server two-stage tandem queueing model for the emergency room triage and treatment process.</br>
