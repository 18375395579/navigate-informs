Lyngby, Denmark, ala@transport.dtu.dk</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a Dynamic Airline Scheduling (DAS) technique which is able to change departure times and reassign aircraft types during the booking process to meet fluctuating passenger demands. The procedure is tested on several different days before departure, resulting in a significant profit increase for a major European airline. The results also indicate that applying DAS close to departure yields the largest potential.</br>
