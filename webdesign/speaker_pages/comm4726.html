<br>Title: A Scheduling Model for Order Processing Operation at Blockbuster</br><br>Author: Casey Chung, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 West Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75083, United States of America, chc022000@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chelliah Sriskandarajah</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Blockbuster distribution maintains multiple processing and packing operations which must be scheduled through a variety of parallel departments which compete for subsequent merge conveyors and sortations systems. We describe here the creation and implementation of a short range scheduling model developed for Blockbuster which uses mixed integer programming which has resulted in annual cost savings of over $1.5 million in addition to an increased system capacity of over 21%.</br>
