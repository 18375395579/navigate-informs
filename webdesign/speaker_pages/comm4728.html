The goal is to minimize a function of the response times of all calls arriving within a finite horizon.  We focus on obtaining good policies for the relocation of idle ambulances that allow the system to anticipate future calls. After presenting a dynamic programming formulation for this problem, we report on the implementation and experimental performance of approximate dynamic programming algorithms.</br>
