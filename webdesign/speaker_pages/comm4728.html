Title: Towards Ambulance Relocation via Approximate Dynamic Programming<br>Author: Mateo Restrepo, PhD Candidate, Center for Applied Math - Cornell University, 657 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, mateo@cam.cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Huseyin Topaloglu, Shane Henderson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a stylized version of the ambulance relocation problem. The goal is to minimize a function of the response times of all calls arriving within a finite horizon.  We focus on obtaining good policies for the relocation of idle ambulances that allow the system to anticipate future calls. After presenting a dynamic programming formulation for this problem, we report on the implementation and experimental performance of approximate dynamic programming algorithms.
