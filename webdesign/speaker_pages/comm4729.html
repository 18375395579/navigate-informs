Title: Optimal Arrival and Departure Strategies at Congested Airports: Aggregate Flow vs Flight Management<br>Author: Eugene Gilbo, US DOT/Volpe Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, gilbo@volpe.dot.gov<br>Coauthor(s): Michael West<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Two approaches to optimization of arrival and departure strategies at airports allowing tradeoffs between arrival and departure capacities are discussed. One is based on matching predicted aggregate demand counts and airport capacity while ignoring predicted arrival and departure times for individual flights. Another approach matches the predicted times for individual flights and available slots consistent with airport capacity. Numerical examples illustrate differences in optimal solutions.
