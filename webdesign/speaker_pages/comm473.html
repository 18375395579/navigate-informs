<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing in a Changing Environment</br><br>Author: Omar Besbes, University of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street, 551 Jon M Huntsman Hall, Philadelphia, PA, United States, obesbes@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Assaf Zeevi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a dynamic pricing problem  in an environment  where the customers' willingness-to-pay distribution is not known and in  addition may change over time. We propose a general class of policies which are characterized by three main modules: surveillance (detection), re-estimation (learning) and  re-optimization (pricing). Trade-offs between these modules are analyzed   and performance guarantees are derived for the proposed policies.</br>
