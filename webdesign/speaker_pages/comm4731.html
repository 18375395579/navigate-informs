Title: Dual-Toll Pricing and Drivers?Preferences in Hazardous Materials Transportation Regulation<br>Author: Changhyun Kwon, Assistant Profesor, University at Buffalo, SUNY, 400 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, chkwon@buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tolou Esfandeh, Masoumeh Taslimi, Rajan Batta<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A dual-toll setting policy is used as an effective and flexible regulation tool to encourage the carriers to route shipments on low risk paths. The proposed model not only aims to minimize the total risk on the network but also to consider the drivers?preferences and priorities in route selection based on toll prices and travel time. Risk measurement model entails the risk in terms of overall accident probability and the consequences of the accident occurrence.
