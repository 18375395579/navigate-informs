Title: Balanced Train Crew Assignment in Double-ended District<br>Author: Yutian Yang, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States of America, robert.yyt@gmail.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Crew scheduling problems in railways involve assigning crew members to scheduled trains at minimum cost while satisfying agreements with labor unions and particular operational policies in railroad companies. In this paper, we develop an optimization model and heuristic algorithms to solve crew assignment in double-ended districts with workload balance requirements which aim to evenly allocate workload across crew pools. We also study two rotation key policies which determine the dispatching order of crews in crew pools. We present the computational study on the real-life data arising from a major North American railroad company.
