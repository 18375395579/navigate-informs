<br>Title: Diffusion Models and Steady-state Approximations for Exponentially Ergodic Markovian Queues</br><br>Author: Itai Gurvich, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, i-gurvich@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by queues with many-servers, we study Brownian steady-state  approximations for continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs). Our approximations are based on diffusion models (rather than a diffusion limit). Within an asymptotic framework, in which a scale parameter n is taken large, a uniform Lyapunov condition is proved to guarantee that the gap between steady-state moments of the diffusion and those of the properly centered and scaled CTMCs, shrinks at a rate of the square root of n.</br>
