Title: Single-sourcing Tradeoffs in a Joint Location-inventory Model<br>Author: Joseph Geunes, Associate Professor, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 303 Weil Hall, P.O.

While the single-sourcing version of the problem has been addressed in the literature, the problem structure and required solution approaches differ when we relax the single-sourcing requirement.  Using a Lagrangian-relaxation approach, we provide a method to quantify the cost of single-sourcing requirements in systems with uncertain demand.
