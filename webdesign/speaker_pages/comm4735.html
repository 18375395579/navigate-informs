<br>Title: Single-sourcing Tradeoffs in a Joint Location-inventory Model</br><br>Author: Joseph Geunes, Associate Professor, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, geunes@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Semra Agrali</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a joint location-inventory problem for locating distribution centers under uncertain demand.  While the single-sourcing version of the problem has been addressed in the literature, the problem structure and required solution approaches differ when we relax the single-sourcing requirement.  Using a Lagrangian-relaxation approach, we provide a method to quantify the cost of single-sourcing requirements in systems with uncertain demand.</br>
