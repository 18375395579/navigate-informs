<br>Title: Tactical Planning in Health Care with Approximate Dynamic Programming</br><br>Author: Martijn Mes, Assistant Professor, University of Twente, Dep. Industrial Engineering and Business, P.O. Box 217, Enschede, 7500AE, Netherlands, m.r.k.mes@utwente.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Hulshof</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a method to develop tactical resource and elective patient admission plans, with the objective to achieve equitable access and treatment duration for patient groups, to serve the strategically agreed target number of patients. We present an Approximate Dynamic Programming approach to determine the number of patients to be treated in each stage of each care process, taking into account multiple resources and multiple patient groups with various care processes.</br>
