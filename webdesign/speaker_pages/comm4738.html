<br>Title: The Power of Flexibility in Dynamic Scheduling : A Case Study</br><br>Author: Chaithanya Bandi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, cbandi@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a multi-resource allocation problem with multiple classes of jobs in a dynamic environment being served by two types of servers, experts and non-experts. The jobs have hard deadlines and arrive randomly but with known seasonality patterns. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing these systems both at the strategic structure level as well as at a tactical level. We demonstrate that by just a little flexibility leads to huge gains in managing load imbalance and efficiency.</br>
