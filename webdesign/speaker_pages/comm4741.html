Title: Sales Territory Optimization<br>Author: Yingdong Lu, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, yingdong@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Squillante<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We determine the optimal allocation of clients to sales resources (territories) according to a set of criteria under uncertainty based on an approach that maps the original stochastic nonlinear MIP to a corresponding multiple, multi-dimensional stochastic knapsacks problem. Fundamental properties of a combination of strategies are established for sequentially allocating a set of items among a collection of knapsacks with respect to maximizing a functional of the overall value of the allocation.
