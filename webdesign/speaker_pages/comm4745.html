Title: Supply Streams<br>Author: Jeannette Song, Professor, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, 1 Towerview  Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, jssong@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul H. Zipkin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A supply stream is a continuous version of a supply chain. It is like a series inventory system, but stock can be held at any point along a continuum, not just at discrete stages. We develop two such models, one with Poisson demand and the other with Brownian-motion demand. For both models we develop tractable computational methods. We also find closed-form solutions for special cases.
