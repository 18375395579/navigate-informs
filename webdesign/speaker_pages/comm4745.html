Zipkin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A supply stream is a continuous version of a supply chain. It is like a series inventory system, but stock can be held at any point along a continuum, not just at discrete stages. We develop two such models, one with Poisson demand and the other with Brownian-motion demand. For both models we develop tractable computational methods. We also find closed-form solutions for special cases.</br>
