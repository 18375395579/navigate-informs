<br>Title: Inventory Assortment and Substitution Problems</br><br>Author: Yehuda Bassok, Professor, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, bassok@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Feng Chen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a general substitution problem, in which consumers choose one of N variants.  We start with a choice model that ranks the preference of each consumer. The preferences of the consumers are not known to the retailer and thus, he assumes that the demand for each variant is random. We derive the retailer’s optimal stocking policy. We show that the role of safety stock is to hedge against the uncertainty in the market size but not the uncertainty in the demand for each of the variants.</br>
