Title: UAV Path Selection Metric using the Particle Filter Framework in an Urban Environment<br>Author: Emily Doucette, Air Force Research Laboratory, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Eglin AFB, FL, United States of America, douceea@tigermail.auburn.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A constant velocity UAV is to intercept a target ground vehicle of unknown position, velocity, and destination within an urban setting. A particle filter with a traffic motion model is used to represent the target state. Binary measurements of subsections of the urban environment are corrupted by false reports. Particle weight along a path is used as a novel path selection metric and is compared to an existing entropy reduction metric by means of intercept and computation time.
