Title: Constructing a Strict Total Order for Alternatives Characterized by Multiple Criteria<br>Author: Akram Dehnokhalaji, Assistant Professor, Kharazmi University (Tehran) and Aalto University School of Economics, Department of Mathematics, Tehran, Iran, akramdehnokhalaji@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Pekka Korhonen, Murat Köksalan, Jyrki Wallenius, Nasim Nasrabadi, Diclehan Tezcaner<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The problem of finding a strict total order for a finite set of multiple criteria alternatives is considered. We extend previous work by us to find a partial order for a finite set of alternatives. The preference information from the preference cones and polyhedral sets and pairwise comparisons yields a preference matrix. The resulting binary relation may not be transitive. We construct an integer programming model resulting a strict total order to rank alternatives.
