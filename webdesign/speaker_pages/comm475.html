We extend previous work by us to find a partial order for a finite set of alternatives. The preference information from the preference cones and polyhedral sets and pairwise comparisons yields a preference matrix. The resulting binary relation may not be transitive. We construct an integer programming model resulting a strict total order to rank alternatives.</br>
