War reserve sustainment stocks are items prepositioned to meet increased demands at the start of a conflict.  Recent research found that war reserve stocks were not well-matched to demands during Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Thus, we assessed an alternative approach to determining war reserve stockage requirements.  Findings suggest that this new method improves performance of the stocks.</br>
