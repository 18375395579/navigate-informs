Title: Determining Stockage Requirements for Army War Reserve Secondary Items: An Alternative Approach<br>Author: Carol Fan, Operations Researcher, RAND Corporation, 1776 Main Street, PO Box 2138, Santa Monica, CA, 90407-2138, United States, Carol_Fan@rand.org<br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Colabella, Kenneth Girardini, Elvira Loredo, Candice Riley<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: During wartime the Army’s higher optempos and readiness requirements increase its demand for supplies.  War reserve sustainment stocks are items prepositioned to meet increased demands at the start of a conflict.  Recent research found that war reserve stocks were not well-matched to demands during Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Thus, we assessed an alternative approach to determining war reserve stockage requirements.  Findings suggest that this new method improves performance of the stocks.
