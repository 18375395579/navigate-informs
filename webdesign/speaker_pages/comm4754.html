Period-by-period arrival rates follow a hidden AR(1) process, and only arrival counts are observed. We formulate stochastic programs to minimize long-run average staffing costs,  subject to a long-run average constraint on abandonment. We show that, in steady state, repeated, myopic solution of the single-period problem is stable, has low cost, and meets the abandonment constraint.</br>
