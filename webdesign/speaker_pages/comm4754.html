Title: Telephone Call Centers: Asymptotic Optimality of Myopic Forecasting-scheduling Scheme<br>Author: Noah Gans, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America, gans@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yong-Pin Zhou, Han Ye, Han Ye<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We determine workforce schedules for call center arrivals that are doubly stochastic. Period-by-period arrival rates follow a hidden AR(1) process, and only arrival counts are observed. We formulate stochastic programs to minimize long-run average staffing costs,  subject to a long-run average constraint on abandonment. We show that, in steady state, repeated, myopic solution of the single-period problem is stable, has low cost, and meets the abandonment constraint.
