<br>Title: Iterative Ranking from Pair-wise Comparisons</br><br>Author: Sahand Negahban, Postdoc, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Room D780, LIDS 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, sahandn@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sewoong Oh, Devavrat Shah</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a global ranking over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it aggregating social opinions or deciding product suggestions. In most settings finding `scores' for each object is of interest to estimate the intensity of a preference. We propose a novel iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects from pairwise comparisons and present has both theoretical and experimental justification for its use.</br>
