Title: Design of Multimodal Transportation System for Cellulosic Biofuel Supply Chain<br>Author: Fei Xie, Graduate Research Assistant, Clemson University, 131K Lowry Hall, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, feix@g.clemson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yongxi Huang, Sandra Eksioglu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We developed a multistage mixed integer programing model that integrates multimodal transport system into a cellulosic biofuel supply chain planning. Strategic decisions on locations/capacities of transshipment hubs, refineries and terminals as well as tactical decisions on system operations such as transporting and storage are optimized in an integrated manner. It is found that compared to single-mode transport system the multimodal system can achieve more economic and environmental benefits.
