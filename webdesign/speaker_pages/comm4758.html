Our system-optimization approach utilizes goal programming to enforce the timely delivery of relief items with respect to the pre-specified time targets at the demand points subject to the uncertain demand being satisfied as closely as possible. The modeling framework integrates the two policies of pre-positioning as well as post-disaster procurement of relief supplies.</br>
