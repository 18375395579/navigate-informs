Title: An Integrated Disaster Relief Supply Chain Network Model with Time Targets and Demand Uncertainty<br>Author: Amir Masoumi, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, Manhattan College, 4513 Manhattan College Pkwy, Riverdale, NY, 10471, United States of America, amir.masoumi@manhattan.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Min Yu, Anna Nagurney<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a supply chain network model for a disaster relief organization in charge of serving certain disaster-prone regions. Our system-optimization approach utilizes goal programming to enforce the timely delivery of relief items with respect to the pre-specified time targets at the demand points subject to the uncertain demand being satisfied as closely as possible. The modeling framework integrates the two policies of pre-positioning as well as post-disaster procurement of relief supplies.
