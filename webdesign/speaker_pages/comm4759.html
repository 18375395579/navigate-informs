Tyrrell Rockafellar, Professor Emeritus, University of Washington, Department of Mathematics, Box 354350, Seattle, WA, 98195-4350, United States, rtr@math.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Zabarankin, Stan Uryasev</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Linear regression, as a way of approximating a random variable by other random variables, is usually approached through least squares, but it can also be carried out in other ways.  This possible through the coordination of axiomatic concepts of error measure, deviation measure and risk measure with certain statistics.   The choice of approach can be tuned to the needs of a particular model in finance or OR more generally.</br>
