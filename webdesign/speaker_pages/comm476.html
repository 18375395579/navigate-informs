Title: Variable Selection: Tractable Upper Bounds on the Restricted Isometry Constant<br>Author: Alexandre D'aspremont, Asst. Professor, Princeton University, Olden St, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, aspremon@princeton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francis Bach, Laurent El Ghaoui<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We use recent semidefinite relaxation results to produce tractable upper bounds on sparse eigenvalues. We then test the performance of these bounds on various random matrices from compressed sensing, for which asymptotic estimates are known.
