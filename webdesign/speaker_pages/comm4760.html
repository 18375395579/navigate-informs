Title: Network Coding Decisions for Wireless Transmissions with Delay Consideration<br>Author: Arupa Mohapatra, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, arupa@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Shakkottai, Alex Sprintson, Natarajan Gautam<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a wireless relay node which uses network coding technique to efficiently transmit packets. However, coding opportunities do not always exist, and waiting for a coding opportunity could result in excessive delay in transmission. We develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model to decide whether to transmit a packet uncoded or wait for transmission in future. We compare the optimal policy in this MDP against other simple heuristic policies.
