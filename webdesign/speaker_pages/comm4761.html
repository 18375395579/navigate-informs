On any round a site has to choose an action: the tradeoff being between using stale information or using communication to get latest information. Recent techniques in streaming and distributed optimization literature do not yield non-trivial algorithms. We give a novel algorithm that simultaneously achieves good regret bounds and sublinear communication.</br>
