Title: A Decision Analysis Approach to Real Option Valuation<br>Author: Ross Shachter, Associate Professor, Management Science and Engineering, Stanford Univeristy, 380 Panama Way, Room 351, Stanford, CA, 94305-4026, United States, shachter@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Derby<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Standard financial option theory assumes rational individuals invest in no-arbitrage, equilibrium, complete markets. Our approach values real options without assuming market equilibrium and completeness. Market information constrains real option value without using replicating portfolios. Our method is consistent with the standard theory, therefore conforms to its major results.
