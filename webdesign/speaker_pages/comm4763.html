This study aims to optimize evacuation under a hypothetical tanker spill. Current gas dispersion models indicate that such a spill may lead to deadly consequences for many persons in this large urban area. In our evacuation model, the objective is to minimize the total exposure of the citizens to the poisonous gas, taking into account the different concentration levels of gas over the space.</br>
