<br>Title: Two Commodities Pickup and Delivery Heuristic to Solve the Containership Routing Problem with Time Windows</br><br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Associate Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, G175F, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sukkusur@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Binh Luong, Rodrigo Mesa-Arango, Matthew Karlaftis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers the containership routing problem for pickups and deliveries of products between a hub and a set of ports. The products are perishable and they need to be collected and delivered in specific time windows. A heuristic approach is proposed and tested using data from a real world ship routing problem. The numerical results demonstrate a good approximation to the optimal solution with considerable computational savings.</br>
