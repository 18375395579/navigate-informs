DC, 57, Colombia, javparrap@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Lindsay Álvarez<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We use a genetic algorithm to do the scheduling with any restrictions as setup time dependent of the sequence and some other that we find typically in medium and small factories. The problem analyzed implies a flow shop system with working centers in parallel and the requirement of manage capacities and turns. In a Brick factory they use generally intuition and experience for make decisions, but they found this genetic algorithm so good, easy and efficient to do it.
