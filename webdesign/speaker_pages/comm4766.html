Title: Route Design for Delivery of Voter Polling Booths in Hamilton County, OH<br>Author: Michael Fry, Assistant Professor, University of Cincinnati, 532 Lindner Hall, QAOM Department, Cincinnati, OH, 45221-0130, United States, fryml@ucmail.uc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Ohlmann<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Starting in Spring 2006, Ohio election sites replaced punch card voting machines with electronic voting machines. In Hamilton County, this change requires the delivery of voting machines to over 500 polling locations over the course of several days. We solve this instance of a vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) using heuristic search techniques and present empirical analysis of the sensitivity of the objective function to the time window and delivery day constraints.
