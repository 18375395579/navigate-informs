In Hamilton County, this change requires the delivery of voting machines to over 500 polling locations over the course of several days. We solve this instance of a vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) using heuristic search techniques and present empirical analysis of the sensitivity of the objective function to the time window and delivery day constraints.</br>
