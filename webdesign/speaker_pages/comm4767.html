Transportation facilities may experience reduced capacity due to (non)recurrent events. This paper analyzes the influence of these supply-demand uncertainties on travel time reliability using the behavioral user equilibrium model. An important practical implication/complication from the findings is that reducing supply or demand uncertainty alone could exacerbate travel time variation and worsen travel reliability.</br>
