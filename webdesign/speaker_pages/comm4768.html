This parameter is a generalization of the classical Grothendieck constant; and it is equal to an integrality gap of a certain SDP problem, which has various algorithmic applications. Our results improve a recent result of Kashin and Szarek on Gram matrices of uniformly bounded   functions, and settle a problem of Megretski and of Charikar and Wirth.</br>
