Title: New Valid Inequalities for the Cardinality Maximum Flow Network Interdiction Problem<br>Author: Doug Altner, Assistant Professor, United States Naval Academy, 572C Holloway Road, Annapolis, MD, 21401, United States of America, altner@usna.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Ergun, Nelson Uhan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The Cardinality Maximum Flow Network Interdiction Problem (CMFNIP) is a Stackelberg game where an interdictor removes R arcs from a network so as to minimize the maximum flow in the network on the remaining arcs. In this talk, we introduce two new classes of valid inequalities for the standard ILP for CMFNIP, we provide polynomial-time separation algorithms for each class and we prove that the integrality gap for this strengthened ILP is contained in the set Omega(|V|^(1-epsilon)).
