Title: Dynamic Leadtime Quotation Under General Customer Utilities<br>Author: Baris Ata, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, b-ata@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tava Olsen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a make-to-order system where customers are dynamically quoted leadtimes (and prices) who have general (non-linear) disutility for delay. We use approximations in the large-capacity asymptotic regime and recommend asymptotically optimal policies for convex, concave, and convex-concave leadtime cost functions. The policies are intuitive and readily implementable and provide delay guarantees for all served customers. They are also tested numerically; resulting in significant benefits.
