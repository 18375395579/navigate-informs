Title: Before Our Ports: Ubiquitous Monitoring for Shipping Container Security<br>Author: Les Atlas, Professor, University of Washington, Department of Electrical Engineering, Box 352500, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, atlas@ee.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick McVittie<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: There has been increasing legislation for solutions which offer continual shipping container content validation and protection at low cost. We have teamed with industry and ports to provide acoustic-based sensing systems, installed at or before the port of lading, which also offer shippers improved container tracking. Active acoustic sensing has being shown to offer an inexpensive and accurate approach for this problem, expanding the possibility of solutions for efficient container security.
