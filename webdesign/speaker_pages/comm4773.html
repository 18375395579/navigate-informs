<br>Title: Evaluating SRPT Based Policies for Parallel Queues</br><br>Author: Douglas Down, Associate Professor, McMaster University, Department of Copmputer and Software, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4l7, Canada, downd@univmail.cis.mcmaster.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of routing jobs to parallel queues where the service time of a job is known on arrival. For various routing strategies, we develop approximations (based on recent results identifying fluid limits for the SRPT discipline in a single queue) to evaluate the performance when SRPT is used as the local scheduling policy. Using these approximations, we compare such policies to other (non-SRPT based) policies, with emphasis on the case when the service times are heavy-tailed.</br>
