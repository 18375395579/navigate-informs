<br>Title: A Sensitivity Analysis of Three Quarterback Rating Statistics</br><br>Author: Laura McLay, Associate Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, lmclay@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Angelis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Quarterbacks can be difficult to rank due to the influence of random events on their input statistics. To investigate this variance, we perform a sensitivity analysis of three quarterback rating statistics: the Traditional rating by Smith, the Burke, and the Wages of Wins ratings. We make comparisons at the team level using data from 2002-2011. We compute ratings with 1-5 additional touchdowns, 1-5 fewer interceptions, 1-5 additional sacks, and a 1-5% increase in the passing completion rate.</br>
