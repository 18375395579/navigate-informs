We consider announcing the delay of the last customer to enter service (LES) to delayed customers, upon arrival. We explicitly model announcement-dependent customer behavior. We show that, for appropriate initial conditions, the LES announcement is asymptotically accurate in both the quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) and the efficiency-driven (ED) many-server heavy-traffic regimes.</br>
