Title: Accuracy of the Last-to-enter Service Delay Announcement<br>Author: Rouba Ibrahim, University College London, Gower Street, London, United Kingdom, rouba.ibrahim@ucl.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Mor Armony, Achal Bassamboo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate ways of making delay announcements in large service systems, such as call centers. We consider announcing the delay of the last customer to enter service (LES) to delayed customers, upon arrival. We explicitly model announcement-dependent customer behavior. We show that, for appropriate initial conditions, the LES announcement is asymptotically accurate in both the quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) and the efficiency-driven (ED) many-server heavy-traffic regimes.
