Title: On Geometric Programming  for Solving Nonstochastic Uncertainty Models in Finance<br>Author: Kenneth Kortanek, Visiting Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, ken-kortanek@uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The underlying law of motion of a financial instrument is a linear differential equation under uncertainty with perturbations for the instrument generating the time series. The dependent variable is an integrand in a discounting mechanism involving an exponentiation, establishing a connection to a two-sided geometric programming problem. Numerical results are presented for the problem of extracting the spot interest rate continuous function from Government Bills, Notes, and Bonds data.
