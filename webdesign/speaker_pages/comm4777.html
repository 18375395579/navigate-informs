(2004) proposed a disclosure limitation method for tabular data that preserves analytical properties of original data--quality-preserving controlled tabular adjustment.  Their approach replaces each sensitive cell with a safe value subject to linear constraints to preserve additivity and parameters such as mean, variance and covariance. We have implemented an alternative algorithm using Kullback-Leibler minimum discrimination information (MDI).</br>
