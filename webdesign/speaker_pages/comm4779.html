<br>Title: Mitigating Interdiction Scenarios to Enable Species Migration</br><br>Author: Jorge Sefair, PhD Student, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, j.sefair@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith, Robert Fletcher, Miguel Acevedo</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a problem in which a species migrates randomly among a network of patches across some region. Interdiction actions on these patches affect the species survival and migration probabilities. Our modeling approach includes an implicit rebalancing of the migration probabilities after the interdictor's actions take place. Our research presents a three-stage optimization model for optimally protecting patches so that the species life expectancy is maximized.</br>
