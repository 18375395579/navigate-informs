PP4, Atlanta, GA, 30309, United States of America, jieyun@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shi-Jie Deng</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a real options model for valuing electric power plants which have fixed generation costs. Under a general continuous-time electricity price model and operational characteristics such as a convex start-up cost structure in the number of re-starts, we derive a market-based valuation and the corresponding optimal operational strategy.</br>
