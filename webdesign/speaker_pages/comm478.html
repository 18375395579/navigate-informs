Title: Continuous-time Optimal Stopping Formulation of Power Plant Valuation with Start-up Costs<br>Author: Jieyun Zhou, Graduate Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 500 Northside Cir NW, Apt. PP4, Atlanta, GA, 30309, United States of America, jieyun@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shi-Jie Deng<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a real options model for valuing electric power plants which have fixed generation costs. Under a general continuous-time electricity price model and operational characteristics such as a convex start-up cost structure in the number of re-starts, we derive a market-based valuation and the corresponding optimal operational strategy.
