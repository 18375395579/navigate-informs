Title: Optimal Policies and Bounds for Parallel Server Systems<br>Author: Michael Veatch, Gordon College, 255 Grapevine Rd, Wenham, MA, 01984, United States, mike.veatch@gordon.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Performance of parallel servers under optimal sequencing control is analyzed using dynamic programming and approximate linear programming. The impact of flexibility is assessed under optimal and longest queue policies. Optimal policy characteristics are found and compared with previous resource pooling conditions.
