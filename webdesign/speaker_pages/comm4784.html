<br>Title: Optimal Work Release Policies for Order Fulfillment Operations</br><br>Author: Kevin Gue, Auburn University, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Auburn, AL, United States of America, kevin.gue@auburn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erdem Çeven</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Order fulfillment firms frequently offer service promises of the sort, Order by this time, and get your shipment the next day.  How do they determine this time?  We show how to determine release times for waves in an order fulfillment center to allow this time to be as late as possible, thus providing the best service to customers and the greatest competitive advantage to the firm.  We illustrate the method with data from a large distributor in the Northeast.</br>
