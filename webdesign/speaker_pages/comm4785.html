Title: Maximum Entropy Distribution based Control Charts<br>Author: Devashish Das, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Department of Industrial Engineering, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, ddas3@wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shiyu Zhou<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this research we developed control charts based on the multivariate maximum entropy estimation of distribution. The maximum entropy distribution had an exponential polynomial form which could be multi-modal in nature. But the implicit function nature of the estimated distribution function helped in defining a new way to deciding control limits.We tested its performance on auto-correlated processes such as waiting time in queuing systems.
