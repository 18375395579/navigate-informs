<br>Title: Optimizing the Allocation of Surgeries to ORs in an Open-Booking  Scheduling System</br><br>Author: Brian Denton, Assistant Professor, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55906, United States, Denton.Brian@mayo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Miller, Huschka Todd</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Hospitals that operate according to open-booking policies allocate large numbers of procedures across many operating rooms each day. The allocation problem is analogous to a stochastic bin-packing problem, where the objective includes expected costs of overtime and fixed costs of opening ORs. We describe our model, solution methods, and numerical results based on real data.</br>
