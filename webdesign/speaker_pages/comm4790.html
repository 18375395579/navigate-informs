This problem is, in general, intractable due to its computational complexity. We develop a simple heuristic that resolves this issue. The heuristic first generates a pricing policy which depends on the initial inventory level. We then transform the joint problem into a standard inventory problem. This heuristic enables us to explore the impact of lead time on the joint decision.</br>
