Title: Freight Railway Operator Timetabling and Engine Routing<br>Author: Lukas Bach, PhD. student, Aarhus University, Fuglesangs alle 4, 8000, Aarhus V, Denmark, luba@asb.dk<br>Coauthor(s): Michel Gendreau, Sanne Wøhlk<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider timetable design at a European freight railway operator. This is done by choosing the time of service for demands among discrete points of service within a time-window. The objective in the model is to minimize cost while adhering to constraints regarding infrastructure usage, demand coverage and engine availability. The model is solved by a column generation scheme where feasible engine routings are designed in a label setting algorithm with time-dependent cost and service times.
