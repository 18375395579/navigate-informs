Title: Approximating Time Delays in Solving Continuous-time Dynamic User Equilibrium<br>Author: Rui Ma, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 173 25th St, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, mar2@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Ban, Jong-Shi Pang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: An analytic dynamic user equilibrium formulation usually contains time delayed terms to capture realistic traffic dynamics, such as flow propagation. Such delay is often time-varying and state-dependent. In this talk, we propose some schemes to approximate such complicated delayed terms with constant delayed terms which are easier to deal with mathematically. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the proposed approximation method.
