Title: The Robust Resource Availability Cost Problem<br>Author: Olivier Lambrechts, Catholic University Leuven, FETEW, KBI, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, BE-3000, Belgium, Olivier.lambrechts@econ.kuleuven.be<br>Coauthor(s): Erik Demeulemeester, Willy Herroelen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Most of the research on robust project scheduling focuses on the scheduling phase assuming a given due-date and resource availability. We extend this work by assuming that a specific project content needs to be delivered by a certain deadline with minimal costs while respecting activity precedence relations and resource capacity constraints that result from resource allocation decisions. Total costs consist of regular resource costs, overtime costs and stability costs.
