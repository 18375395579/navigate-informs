Geography & Env. Engineering, Baltimore, MD, United States, bhobbs@jhu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J.-S. Pang, Jinye Zhao, Yihsu Chen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: By basing the allocation of CO2 emissions allowance on investment decisions, carbon trading systems (including the EU) risk distorting investments. A long run capacity equilibrium problem is formulated subject to allocation rules, and is analyzed for existence of solutions. Simulations show a potential for large distortions.</br>
