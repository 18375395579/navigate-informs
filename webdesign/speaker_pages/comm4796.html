Title: Transmission Expansion Planning as a Dynamic MILP that Considers the Long Term Availability of Wind<br>Author: Enzo Sauma, Associate Professor, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Ave. Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, RM, Chile, esauma@ing.puc.cl<br>Coauthor(s): Javier Contreras, Jose Aguado, Sebastián De la Torre<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: There are still several challenges to be faced in the transmission planning problem. In particular, considering large market penetration of wind energy, there are challenges associated, for instance, to the analysis of the uncertainty associated to the long-term availability of the wind resource. We formulate the transmission expansion planning problem as a dynamic (multi-period) Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, in which we model the long term availability of wind energy.
