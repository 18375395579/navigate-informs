Title: Design of Effective and Efficient Service Delivery Processes<br>Author: Gang Li, Assistant Professor, Bentley University, Waltham, MA, 02452, United States of America, gli@bentley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joy Field, Mark Davis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A major challenge in service process design is balancing high levels of efficiency with high levels of customer service. We introduce a design approach that integrates back office and front office components of the service that creates opportunities to share employee resources. Based on the time sensitivity of activities and the relative efficiencies and costs of each employee type, our model determines the optimal allocation of employee types that provides a given service level at minimum cost.
