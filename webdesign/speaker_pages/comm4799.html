<br>Title: Resource Management Problems in Hospital Emergency Response</br><br>Author: Mohsen Jafari, Professor, Rutgers University, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, CoRE Building, Room 201, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, Jafari@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Davood Golmohammadi, Kian Seyed</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Here we focus on the problem of human resource management for hospital emergency response. Both emergency evacuation and surge capacity are considered. For evacuation, the objective is to maximize the number of patients evacuated within allowable time windows, and minimize the overall evacuation time. For surge capacity, the objective is to maximize the number of patients admitted, while minimizing the response time.  We discuss our findings from simulations of real life scenarios. Scheduling alternatives and the corresponding performance measures are also presented.</br>
