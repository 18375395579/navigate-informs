To avoid over-scheduling cadets, the Registrar’s office used a greedy heuristic to de-conflict the academic departments and determine a schedule. We present an improvement to this approach that uses a mixed-integer optimization formulation to minimize schedule conflicts and meet department preferences. The model was successfully incorporated into the Academy’s scheduling system in the Fall of ?4.</br>
