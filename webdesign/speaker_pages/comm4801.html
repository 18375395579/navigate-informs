Title: Heuristics for Scheduling a Single Machine with Family-Dependent Setup Times<br>Author: Reha Uzsoy, Professor, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, uzsoy@ecn.purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Juan Diego Velasquez<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We examine the problem of minimizing maximum lateness on a single machine with family dependent setup times. We develop several heuristics including a rolling horizon approach and an incomplete dynamic program based on the algorithm of Monma and Potts(1989). Computational results are provided.
