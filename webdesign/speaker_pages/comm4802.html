Title: A Practicable Framework for Distributional Robust Optimization with Application in Portfolio Selection<br>Author: Meilin Zhang, Phd Candidate, NUS, 01-06, Biz2, NUS, Singapore, Singapore, 117592, Singapore, meilin.zhang@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Melvyn Sim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a new framework for robust optimization under distributional ambiguity, which can be used in  portfolio selection problems where the distributions of the underlying returns are not fully characterized. The ambiguity set is characterized by the projections of means and bounds on expectations of convex utility functions of the underlying uncertainties.
