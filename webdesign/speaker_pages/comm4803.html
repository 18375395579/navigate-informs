Title: Creating Lists Using the Internet<br>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, rudin@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Letham, Katherine Heller<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We want to combine the knowledge of many people (experts) in order to create lists of things that go together, starting from a small seed. This is the same problem that Google Sets was designed to solve. Our algorithm involves a combinatorial search, a large scale clustering algorithm, and an implicit feedback loop.
