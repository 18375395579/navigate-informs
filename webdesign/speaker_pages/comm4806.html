Title: Reductions of Approximate Linear Programs for Network Revenue Management<br>Author: Dan Zhang, University of Colorado at Boulder, 995 Regent Dr, Boulder, CO, 80305, United States of America, Dan.Zhang@Colorado.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Vossen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider equivalent reductions of approximate linear programs (ALPs) for network revenue management by exploring the relationship between ALPs and appropriate Dantzig-Wolfe reformulations. Dramatic reduction of ALP problem sizes are shown for (i) separable piecewise linear approximation under independent demand model, and (ii) affine approximation with customer choice behavior.
