Title: Real-time Container Storage Location Assignment at a Seaport Container Transshipment Terminal<br>Author: Matthew Petering, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee, Industrial & Manufacturing Engrg. Dept., P.O. Box 784, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States, mattpete@uwm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Katta Murty<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present several new results on real-time container storage location assignment at a container terminal.  Several alternatives are evaluated by a fully-dynamic simulation model that considers the detailed movement of every container passing through a terminal over a several week period.  The model, based on the author’s extended on-site experience at a major container terminal, directly connects the storage policy to the overall productivity (i.e. long-run gross crane rate) of the facility.
