<br>Title: Improving the Objective Function of the Fleet Assignment Problem</br><br>Author: Jonathan Dumas, GERAD, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, 2920, Chemin de la Tour, 4e étage, Montreal, QC, Canada, jonathan.dumas@gerad.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): François Soumis, Fati Aithnard</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The objective function of the standard fleet assignment problem (FAP) is linear in the FAP's binary decision variables. It is hard to make it account correctly  for the expected revenue associated with each tentative fleet assignment. We explain how we use a non-linear passenger flow model to iteratively improve the FAP's objective function, and to infuse it with information on network effects, recapture and on the temporal and stochastic nature of the booking process.</br>
