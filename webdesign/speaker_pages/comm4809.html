In practice, it is a complex task as it involves a deep understanding of customers?travel behaviour and their sensitivity to tickets' prices. We propose an approach that tackles this challenge when managing revenues for a public transport operator. We derive a quadratic program that maximizes total revenues and explicitly addresses demand uncertainty. Numerical results are encouraging.</br>
