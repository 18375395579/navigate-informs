<br>Title: Estimating Mixtures of Willingness-To-Pay Distributions from Hotel Rate and Occupancy Data</br><br>Author: Chris Keller, Assistant Professor, East Carolina University, College of Business, 3136 Bate Building, Greenville, NC, 27858, United States of America, kellerc@ecu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This presentation uses daily rate and occupancy data for a mid-market hotel and it competitive set to estimate mixtures of distributions for customer willingness-to-pay.  The presentation considers various numbers of mixture distributions and various types of distributions in order to maximize goodness-of-fit to observed rates and occupancies.  The distributions are also collectively varied by day, week, and month.</br>
