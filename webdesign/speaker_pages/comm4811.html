Title: Restoration of Road Network Connectivity After a Disaster<br>Author: F. Sibel Salman, College of Engineering, Ko?University, Istanbul, Turkey, ssalman@ku.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Ayse Nur Kibar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In a natural disaster road networks can be damaged and consequently some parts of the network may be disconnected.To facilitate emergency transportation, a critical subset of the blocked roads should be cleared to restore network connectivity as soon as possible. A fleet of machinery should be dispatched for this task. We define an optimization problem to generate a coordinated work schedule. The problem is to determine which blocked arcs to open and a walk for each vehicle starting at its depot that collectively cover the selected blocked arcs. The objective is to minimize the total time of the longest walk, i.e. the makespan.
