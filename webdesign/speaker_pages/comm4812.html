The upper level searches for the best distribution strategies with the objectives of minimizing the total evacuation clearance time. The lower level problem handles routing of evacuation traffic with the cell transmission model adopted to mathematically represent dynamic traffic flow evolution and queuing in an evacuation network.</br>
