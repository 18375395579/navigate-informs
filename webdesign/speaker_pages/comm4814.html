Title: Finding the Minimum Network that Maximizes Service<br>Author: Hui Chen, hui-chen@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ann Campbell, Barrett Thomas<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Many national delivery providers offer delivery time commitments between cities. These commitments direct the design of the delivery network.  In this network, each arc defines a direct connection between cities and represents a substantial investment. The minimum cost network that connects all cities is a tree, but a tree may not satisfy all of the delivery commitments. We find a tree that minimizes the maximum delivery time violation and present computational results based on the U.S.
