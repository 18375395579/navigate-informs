These commitments direct the design of the delivery network.  In this network, each arc defines a direct connection between cities and represents a substantial investment. The minimum cost network that connects all cities is a tree, but a tree may not satisfy all of the delivery commitments. We find a tree that minimizes the maximum delivery time violation and present computational results based on the U.S.</br>
