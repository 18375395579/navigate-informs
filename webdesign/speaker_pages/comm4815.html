We first establish a few important properties for the model that characterize the convexity of the problem and the impact of risk aversion. For identical products with independent demands, increased risk aversion leads to decreased orders. For a large but finite number of different products with independent demands, we derive closed form approximations of the optimal order quantities.</br>
