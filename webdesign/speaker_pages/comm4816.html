<br>Title: Communication Models for a Cooperative Networks of Autonomous Agents</br><br>Author: Clayton Commander, Air Force Research Laboratory, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Ste. 144, Eglin AFB, FL, 32542, United States, commandc@eglin.af.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ashwin Arulselvan, Panos Pardalos, Mauricio G. C. Resende, Michael Hirsch</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The cooperative communication problem on mobile ad-hoc networks (CCPM) deals with maximizing the connectivity for a set of wireless agents as they traverse a graph from a set of source nodes to a set of destination nodes. Here we introduce continuous formulations and compare the results of several case studies.  This provides a more realistic model of the problem as supported by the numerical evidence.</br>
