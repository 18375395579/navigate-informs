Title: Communication Models for a Cooperative Networks of Autonomous Agents<br>Author: Clayton Commander, Air Force Research Laboratory, 101 W.

Resende, Michael Hirsch<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The cooperative communication problem on mobile ad-hoc networks (CCPM) deals with maximizing the connectivity for a set of wireless agents as they traverse a graph from a set of source nodes to a set of destination nodes. Here we introduce continuous formulations and compare the results of several case studies.  This provides a more realistic model of the problem as supported by the numerical evidence.
