Agent can receive an amount of a commodity only if the network contains an arc connecting her to it. The relevant fairness notion in reallocation problems is ``fair  net trades [Schmeidler, D. and K. Vind. 1972. Fair net trades. Econometrica, 40, 637-642]. When a single commodity is to be reallocated, we identify the only strategy-proof Pareto-efficient allocation rule satisfying fair net trades.</br>
