Title: Inventory Control with a Cash Register: Sales Recorded but Not Demand or Shrinkage<br>Author: Metin Cakanyildirim, Associate Professor of Operations Management, University of Texas at Dallas, P. O. Box 830688, Richardson, TX, 75080-0688, United States of America, metin@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Meng Li, Suresh Sethi, Alain Bensoussan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Inventory is subject to unobserved shrinkages happening both before and after the demand realization and it is inaccurate. Our objective is to minimize the expected discounted cost related to inventory holdings and shortages over an infinite horizon. We obtain a lower bound on the cost analytically and develop an iterative algorithm, and compare its solution to a myopic solution.
