Title: Modeling Containerized Cargo Shipments Between Ocean Port and Handling Facilities<br>Author: Anne Goodchild, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, 121E More Hall, Box 352700, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, annegood@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kaori Fujisawa, Eric Jessup<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This research presents a model of container freight movement between ocean ports and handling facilities.  We estimate shipper behavior by estimating logistics costs for a set of transportation choices based on shipper volume and value.  The model is a practical tool, primarily for policy makers, to understand the impact of land value changes, transportation capacity, and other inputs on logistics strategies and therefore freight flows.
