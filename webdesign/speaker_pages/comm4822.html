Trafalis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Known formulas to solve the facility allocation problem (FAP) in the literature assume either a planar or spherical surface with the allocation of the facilities to be changing either discretely or continuously. In this work we use Riemannian Manifold Surfaces with geodesic distances to allocate facilities; a generalization of the known surface and distance assumptions.
