Title: Rare-event Simulation for Heavy-tailed Multi-server Queues<br>Author: Jingchen Liu, Harvard University, 1 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, jcliu@stat.harvard.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jose Blanchet, Peter W. Glynn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: I will present the first provably efficient simulation algorithm for steady-state estimation of long delays in a positive recurrent two-server queue with heavy-tailed service requirement. In such systems, long delays are usually caused by one or two customers who have extremely large service requirement and block the servers for long time. We propose a three-step program to design the algorithm and prove its efficiency.
