Central Campus Dr., Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, xzhou99@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lingyun Meng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The rail network capacity can be defined as the maximum train paths that can be operated on a rail network within a time period under given train characteristics and level of service (LOS). This talk presents a maximum network flow based linear programming formulation to estimate the network capacity subject to different given LOS constraints. The model is solved by a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm on a number of real-world test cases.</br>
