<br>Title: Design of Multistage Pull Control Systems</br><br>Author: Ronald Askin, Professor, Arizona State University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287-5906, United States, Ron.Askin@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shravan Krishnan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A model is presented to guide the partitioning of multistage, multiproduct, stochastic, dynamic production systems into a series of control sections. Pull control is used to release jobs and coordinate between sections. Push control is used within sections in that released jobs flow without requiring additional authorizations. Flow time and inventory cost are minimized subject to service level constraints.</br>
