Title: Arbitrary Throughput and Complexity Tradeoffs in Presence of Delay Guarantees in Wireless Networks<br>Author: Saswati Sarkar, Associate Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 200 S. 33rd St., Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, swati@seas.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Saikat Ray<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a class of parameterized policies  that given any positive constant a that is between 0 and 1,  approximates the maximum throughput region  in a large class of wireless networks within a factor of a,  using a computation time that depends only on the maximum node degree and a.  These policies also attain asymptotically optimal delays in these networks.
