Title: An Analysis of the Convex Hull of Two-period Submodels of Production Planning Problems<br>Author: Andrew Miller, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 3156 Engineering Centers Building, 1550 Engineering Drive, Madison, WI, United States of America, amiller@engr.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kerem Akartunali<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Despite the significant attention they have drawn, big bucket production planning problems remain notoriously difficult to solve. We discuss results indicate that what make these problems difficult are the embedded single-machine, single-level, multi-period submodels. We therefore consider the simplest such submodel: a multi-item, two-period capacitated model. We discuss this model's polyhedral structure, and how useful knowing this structure could be in solving more complicated problems.
