<br>Title: Asymptotic Optimality of Order-up-to Policies in Lost Sales Inventory Systems</br><br>Author: Ganesh Janakiraman, Assistant Professor, Stern School of Business, NYU, 44 West Fourth St., Room 8-71, New York, NY, 10012, United States, gjanakir@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paat Rusmevichientong, John Muckstadt, Woonghee Tim Huh</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study a single-location inventory system under periodic review, where excess demand is lost. The lead time is positive. For a large class of demand distributions, we show that when the lost sales penalty becomes large compared to the holding cost, the relative difference between the cost of the optimal policy and the best order-up-to policy  converges to zero.</br>
