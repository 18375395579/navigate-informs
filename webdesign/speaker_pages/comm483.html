<br>Title: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Integrated Assessment Model</br><br>Author: Robert Barron, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 219 Elab Building, Amherst, MA, United States of America, barron@engin.umass.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many integrated assessment models neglect Induced Technological Change (ITC). We propose a means of modeling ITC within the Dynamic Integrated Model of the Climate and Economy (DICE). We find that the deployment and cost breakdown (between integration and technology costs) of solar photovoltaics are sensitive to returns to scale. These findings have important implications for the value of information with respect to integration costs and the optimal allocation of R&D resources.</br>
