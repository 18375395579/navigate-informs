<br>Title: Accelerated Burn-in and Condition-based Maintenance for N-subpopulations Subject to Stochastic Degradation</br><br>Author: Yisha Xiang, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, xiangysh@mail.sysu.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Coit, Qianmei Feng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: For some manufacturing applications, populations of manufactured components can consist of several sub-populations.  A new model is developed to determine accelerated burn-in and condition-based maintenance policies for heterogeneous populations. We also compare the proposed joint accelerated burn-in and condition-based maintenance policy with two benchmark policies.  Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the value of joint accelerated burn-in and condition-based maintenance policy.</br>
