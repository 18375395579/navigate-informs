<br>Title: Mathematical Models for Hospital Inpatient Flow Management</br><br>Author: Pengyi Shi, PhD student, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, pengyishi@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J.G. Jim Dai</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by hospital inpatient flow management, we study a many-server queueing system with arrival being periodic Poisson and servers representing inpatient beds. The system has two critical features: (i) each customer's (patient’s) service time depends on admission and discharge times, and the number of nights she stays; and (ii) there are extra delays during the admission and discharge processes. We develop analytical methods to predict the system’s time-dependent performances.</br>
