Title: Evaluation of Linear Sensor System Reliability Using Monte Carlo Methods<br>Author: Yong Chen, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States, yongchen@engineering.uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Qingyu Yang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Linear sensor systems have broad applications in manufacturing fault diagnosis, array signal processing, and wireless sensor networks. Evaluating the reliability of linear sensor systems is an NP hard problem. In this paper, Monte Carlo methods are applied to evaluate/approximate the linear sensor system reliability and their performances are compared.
