Title: Large Graph Limits for Configurational Constructions of Random Networks - Applications to SIR Epidemy<br>Author: Pascal Moyal, Universit?de Technologie de Compiègne, Rue Roger Couttolenc, CS 60319, Compiègne, 60203, France, pascal.moyal@utc.fr<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present two constructions of random networks inspired by the configuration model: the course of a SIR epidemy on a human population, and the processing   of a CSMA algortithm on a set of interacting nodes. In both cases, we construct, and represent the population by partially constructed random graphs, described   in turn by point measure-valued processes.  We then obtain fluid limits for these processes under large graph limit.
