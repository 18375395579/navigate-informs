This method applies to situatuions when queues from one link can spill back to upstream links, and is implemented with the help of a dynamic loading procedure, from which the cumulative curves for each link are obtained to evaluate small variations in link travel times, which in turn provides the MC for congestion pricing in such a network.</br>
