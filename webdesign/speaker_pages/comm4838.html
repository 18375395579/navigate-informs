Title: Bike Sharing with Multi-period Schedule Delay within Host Transit Network<br>Author: Hamidreza Sabarshad, Ryerson University, 87 Steeles Ave. East, Toronto, ON, 2M2 3Y4, Canada, hsabarsh@ryerson.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Chow<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A multi-periodic optimization is formulated to design a bike-sharing system for travel as a means to extend public transport for access and egress trips. The model is applied to evaluate existing bike sharing system designs such as the BIXI system in Toronto to gain greater insight to its impact on public transport ridership.
