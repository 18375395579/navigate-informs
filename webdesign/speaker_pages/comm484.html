Title: Integrating the Extended Gateway Concept in Long-term Strategic Seaport Planning: A European Case<br>Author: Michael Dooms, MSc, Senior Researcher, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2Elsene, Brussels, 1050, Belgium, michael.dooms@vub.ac.be<br>Coauthor(s): Alain Verbeke<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrative conceptual framework for strategic seaport planning. We analyse port impacts from an extended gateway perspective i.e. integrating a geographical dimension in the framework in order to formally link and consistently align the port’s long-term development with the infrastructural development of the wider region and the country as a whole.
