<br>Title: A Stochastic Multi Criteria Model for Joint Inventory-Transportation Policies in Supply Chains.</br><br>Author: Ajay Natarajan, PhD Student, Penn State University, 445 Waupelani Drive, E 5, State College, PA, 16801, United States, azn110@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This presentation deals with finding inventory policies for each company in a Single Warehouse Multi Retailer system under stochastic demand and stochastic lead times when transportation costs are considered. Each company follows a continuos review policy. Excess demand faced by the retailers and the warehouse is treated as lost sales. Service level constraint is treated as an independent criterion. The methodology is explained with the help of an example problem.</br>
