Title: Optimal Aviation Security Screening Strategies with Dynamic Passenger Risk Updates<br>Author: Sheldon Jacobson, Professor, University of Illinois, 201 N. Goodwin Avenue (MC258), urbana, IL, 61821, United States of America, shj@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Adrian Lee, Alexander Nikoleav<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Multistage Sequential Passenger Screening Problem is formulated for aviation security systems, with passenger risks initialized upon arrival and updated as passengers pass through multiple screening stages. Optimal screening policies are obtained using sequential assignment theory. Monte Carlo simulation-based heuristics are developed and compared with other algorithms for a two-stage MSPSP.
