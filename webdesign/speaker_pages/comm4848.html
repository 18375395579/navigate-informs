Title: Performance Analysis of Zone-picking Systems<br>Author: Ivo Adan, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, Netherlands, iadan@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Jelmer van der Gaast, Ren?De Koster, Jacques Resing<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider zone picking systems, where totes travel between zones to collect items. If a tote tries to enter a fully occupied zone, then the tote is blocked and recirculated in the network. This system is approximated by a closed multi-class queueing network with jump-over blocking. We develop an iterative algorithm based on mean value analysis to evaluate  blocking probabilities and performance characteristics such as utilization and throughput.
