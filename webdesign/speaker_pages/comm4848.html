If a tote tries to enter a fully occupied zone, then the tote is blocked and recirculated in the network. This system is approximated by a closed multi-class queueing network with jump-over blocking. We develop an iterative algorithm based on mean value analysis to evaluate  blocking probabilities and performance characteristics such as utilization and throughput.</br>
