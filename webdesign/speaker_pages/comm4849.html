<br>Title: Skill Based FCFS Service Systems</br><br>Author: Gideon Weiss, University of Haifa, Mount Carmel 31905, Haifa, Israel, gweiss@stat.haifa.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ivo Adan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider systems with several types of customers and several types of servers, where compatibility of servers to customers is given by a bipartite graph.  This is motivated by call centers with skill based routing, and by organ transplant applications.  A common approach is provided by infinite first come first served matching of two infinite multi-type random sequences.  We obtain explicit results for this model, and approximations for many server queues with abandonments.</br>
