Title: Skill Based FCFS Service Systems<br>Author: Gideon Weiss, University of Haifa, Mount Carmel 31905, Haifa, Israel, gweiss@stat.haifa.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Ivo Adan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider systems with several types of customers and several types of servers, where compatibility of servers to customers is given by a bipartite graph.  This is motivated by call centers with skill based routing, and by organ transplant applications.  A common approach is provided by infinite first come first served matching of two infinite multi-type random sequences.  We obtain explicit results for this model, and approximations for many server queues with abandonments.
