<br>Title: Determining Fueling and Servicing Feasible Locomotive Plans</br><br>Author: Ravindra Ahuja, Professor, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, ahuja@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Larry Shughart, James Orlin, Balachandran Vaidyanathan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The locomotive planning problem consists of assigning locomotives to a weekly train schedule so that each train receives sufficient tonnage and horsepower. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature for locomotive planning but none of these approaches produces a fueling and servicing feasible plan. This presentation will describe an integer programming-based heuristic to obtain such a locomotive plan.</br>
