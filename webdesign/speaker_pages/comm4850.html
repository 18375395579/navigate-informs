<br>Title: Service Systems with Experience-based Anecdotal Reasoning Customers</br><br>Author: Tingliang Huang, Assistant Professor, University College London, Gower Street, Department of Management Science & Innov, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, t.huang@ucl.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ying-Ju Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The existing queueing literature typically assumes that customers either perfectly know the expected waiting time or are able to form rational expectations about it. In contrast, in this paper we study canonical service models where customers do not have such full information or capability. We assume that customers can only rely on past experiences and anecdotal reasoning to make their joining or balking decisions.</br>
