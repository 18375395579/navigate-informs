Title: Automated Design of Multistage Mechanisms<br>Author: Tuomas Sandholm, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, sandholm@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vincent Conitzer, Craig Boutilier<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We extend automated mechanism design to the design of multistage mechanisms.  Our approach is based on algorithms for converting single-stage dominant-strategy mechanisms into  multistage mechanism. For Bayes-Nash mechanisms, we prove that the preference elicitor may be better off randomizing over queries and hiding elicited results from the agents.
