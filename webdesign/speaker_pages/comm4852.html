Title: Closure Systems and State Spaces<br>Author: Alex Pogel, mathematician, Physical Science Laboratory, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, 88003, United States, apogel@psl.nmsu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk we will discuss the use of a closure system (a mathematical structure corresponding to set systems closed under intersection) as data-driven state space formed from a two-dimensional description of a system. We will describe connections of closure systems to Formal Concept Analysis (Ganter, Wille, Wolff, et al), knowledge spaces (Falmagne, Doignon, et al), and MMF (Deitz, Sheehan, et al).
