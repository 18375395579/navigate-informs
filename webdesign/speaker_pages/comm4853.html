<br>Title: Cellular Bucket Brigades on U-lines with Discrete Work Stations</br><br>Author: Yun Fong Lim, Singapore Management University, 50 Stamford Rd #04-01, Singapore, Singapore, yflim@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yue Wu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose an operating protocol to coordinate workers on a U-line with discrete stations. Under the protocol the system can be configured such that its productivity is maximized. Workers are allowed to dynamically share work so that the system can effectively absorb the impact of variability. Increasing the number of stations in each stage from one to two may improve productivity significantly, but further dividing the U-line into more stations has diminishing return.</br>
