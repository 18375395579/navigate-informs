<br>Title: Multi-level, Multi-type Matching Queues</br><br>Author: Sherwin Doroudi, Graduate Student, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, sdoroudi@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kristen Gardner, Mor Harchol-Balter, Alan Scheller-Wolf</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: There is a newly emerging class of online games where players differ in both level and type. Players can only be matched if they have complementary types, with preference given to matches between similar levels. For example, native English speakers learning intermediate Spanish prefer native Spanish speakers learning intermediate English. We propose matching policies along with tools to analyze these policies under Markovian assumptions. We study tradeoffs between waiting time and match quality.</br>
