With non-negligible probabilities for false positives and false negatives, mobile sensors leave two data trails across potential target locations that have been explored. By endowing mobile sensors with a simple trail data processing rule, we show that a form of rational swarm intelligence emerges as sensors successfully coordinate indirectly (i.e. they locate all targets) through active manipulation of the trails.</br>
