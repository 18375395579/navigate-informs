Title: Rational Swarms for Distributed On-line Bayesian Search<br>Author: Alfredo Garcia, Associate Professor, University of Virginia, 151 Engineer's Way, Charlottesville, VA, 22904, United States, agarcia@virginia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fernan Pedraza, Chenyang Li<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a novel scheme for distributed search in mobile sensors networks. With non-negligible probabilities for false positives and false negatives, mobile sensors leave two data trails across potential target locations that have been explored. By endowing mobile sensors with a simple trail data processing rule, we show that a form of rational swarm intelligence emerges as sensors successfully coordinate indirectly (i.e. they locate all targets) through active manipulation of the trails.
