This wide variety of conditions acts to reduce the network-wide power imbalance, albeit in an uncoordinated fashion. Recognizing that this uncoordinated cooperation is beneficial to the economic efficiency and security of a power system, we develop an imbalance cost allocation method effectively rewarding this cooperation.</br>
