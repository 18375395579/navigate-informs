Title: Treatment Planning for Radiofrequency Ablation of Liver Tumors<br>Author: Ariela Sofer, George Mason University, asofer@gmu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In radiofrequency ablation, one or more needles are placed at the tumor site and generate heat. Temperatures above 50 Celsius kill tissue. Treatment planning determines the number of needles and their positions to kill the tumor and limit damage to vital tissue. We discuss solution approaches to the problem.
