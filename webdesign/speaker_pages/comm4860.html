Freight is added to the existing HST system of Turkey which is currently used only for passengers. A scheduling model is constructed to observe the effects of freight transportation in two cases: adding separate freight trains to the system and using the same trains with passengers for freight transportation. Several factors were determined to choose between two cases at certain conditions.
