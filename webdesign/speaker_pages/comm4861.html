This paper considers a call center with cross-selling capabilities that serves heterogeneous customers. It studies the operational decisions of staffing, call routing, and cross-selling under varying levels of customer segmentation. It derives near-optimal policies, and characterizes the impact of increased customer segmentation on the structure of these policies and the center's profitability.
