Title: Minimizing Movement in Mobile Facility Location Problems<br>Author: Zachary Friggstad, University of Alberta, 221 Athabasca Hall, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2E8, Canada, zacharyf@cs.ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): MohammadReza Salavatipour<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the mobile facility location problem we are given a set of clients and facilities located throughout a graph.  The goal is to find destinations for the clients and facilities so that each client is sent to the same node as some facility while minimizing the total distance traveled by all clients and facilities.  We present the first constant-ratio approximation algorithm for this problem and observe substantial lower bounds for this problem and a natural bottleneck variant.
