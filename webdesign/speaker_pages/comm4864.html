We develop an optimization model to decide high-mark utilization and low-mark utilization values to turn on and off VMs while minimizing provisioning and maintenance costs. Solving the same optimization problem at different points in time provides us with a dynamic VM load balancing policy. The robustness of the policy relies on the agility of periodical model corrections.</br>
