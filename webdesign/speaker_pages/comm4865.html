Title: Approximation Algorithms for Stochastic Lot-sizing Inventory Control<br>Author: Cong Shi, Student, MIT Operations Research Center, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-135, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, shicong@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop an algorithmic approach to compute provably near-optimal policies for multiperiod stochastic lot-sizing inventory models with stochastic, non-stationary and correlated demands that evolve over time. The approach can be extended to serial network topology with fixed costs, for which very little is known about the optimal policies.
