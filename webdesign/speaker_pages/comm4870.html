Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop an optimal routing strategy for a search and rescue problem with a limited number of units which possess the ability for wireless communication. The location and number of individuals are represented via probability distributions at each node.  Problem variants, properties and search heuristics will be discussed.</br>
