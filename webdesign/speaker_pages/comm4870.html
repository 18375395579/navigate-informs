Title: An Online Search and Rescue Algorithm<br>Author: David Fajardo, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Texas-Austin, Center for Transportation Research, 3208 Red River Street, Suite 200, Austin, TX, 78705, United States, davidf@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We develop an optimal routing strategy for a search and rescue problem with a limited number of units which possess the ability for wireless communication. The location and number of individuals are represented via probability distributions at each node.  Problem variants, properties and search heuristics will be discussed.
