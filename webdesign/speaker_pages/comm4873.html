However, the standard MSVM does not select variables and the solution utilizes all input variables, which can hurt its accuracy and interpretability especially for high dimensional data. We propose a novel type of regularization for MSVM based on the supnorm penalty and its adaptive form, which automates variable selection process and improves the standard MSVM.</br>
