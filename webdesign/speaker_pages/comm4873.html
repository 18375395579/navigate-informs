Title: Variable Selection for Multicategory SVM Via Sup-norm  Regularization<br>Author: Hao Zhang, North Carolina State University, Campus Box 8203, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, haohelen.zhang@gmail.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MSVM) is a popular classification method in machine learning and has many successful applications. However, the standard MSVM does not select variables and the solution utilizes all input variables, which can hurt its accuracy and interpretability especially for high dimensional data. We propose a novel type of regularization for MSVM based on the supnorm penalty and its adaptive form, which automates variable selection process and improves the standard MSVM.
