<br>Title: Airline Price Prediction to Optimize Ticket Purchase Time</br><br>Author: William Groves, PhD Student, University of Minnesota, 200 Union St SE Ste 4-192, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, groves@cs.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maria Gini</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Airline ticket prices change with demand and due to competitive actions by other airlines.  We propose a method which combines domain knowledge provided by the user with systematic search to obtain a feature set which is optimal for predicting prices and optimizing purchase time.  The constraints used for feature set selection prevent overfitting and improve prediction even with small data sets.  Experiments show average cost reductions of 7.2 percent on both international and domestic routes.</br>
