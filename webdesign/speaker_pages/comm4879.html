Title: Can Randomness Buy Clairvoyance? Stochastic Scheduling of Mixed Criticality Real-time Job Systems<br>Author: Bader Al-Ahmad, PhD Student, University of British Columbia, 2205 Lower Mall, P.O BOX 70, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z4, Canada, baderalahmad84@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Sathish Gopalakrishnan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We pose the problem of stochastically scheduling mixed criticality jobs  when job execution time distributions at all criticality levels are given. By stochastic, the dynamical evolution of the system criticality level over time is captured by a stochastic process. We ask: is such information any beneficial in reducing the pessimism of current deterministic algorithms? Our objective is to match as closely the performance of a powerful oracle that knows the future system behavior realization.
