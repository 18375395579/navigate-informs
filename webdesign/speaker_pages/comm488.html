Title: Extending Performance Metric from Factory View to Global Manufacturing Networks<br>Author: Hans Ehm, Principal Logistics Systems, Infineon, Am Campeon 1-12, Neubiberg, Ge, 85579, Germany, hans.ehm@infineon.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ralf Lelickens<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Managing the Characteristic Curve enabled: short cycle time and a high capacity utilization. Can this approach be transferred to a multifab multi supply chain production network? Yes, but it requires the extension of the Characteristic Curve from a factory approach to global production network. This is  demonstrated on the example of factory capacity planning (the IFX HTCP - Harmonized Test Capacity Planning - project).
