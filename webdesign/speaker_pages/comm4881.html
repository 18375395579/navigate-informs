<br>Title: Computational Mixed Convexity Results for the Erlang Delay and Loss Formulae in Telecommunication Network Queuing Systems</br><br>Author: Emre Tokgoz, Faculty - Lecturer, University of Oklahoma, 601 Elm Ave. Room 423, Norman, OK, 73019, United States of America, Emre.Tokgoz-1@ou.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hillel Kumin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In queueing theory, the known results for the Erlang delay and loss formulae convexity are determined by either assuming the discrete variable, the number of servers, or the real variable, the service rate, is constant. In this work, compared to the known convexity results in the literature, strong computational mixed convexity results are obtained for the Erlang delay and loss formulae by applying a new convexity technique.</br>
