<br>Title: Designing Intervention Scheme for Public-Interest Goods Under Random Supply</br><br>Author: Ece Demirci, Ph.D. Student, Bilkent University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, edemirci@bilkent.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nesim Erkip</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of designing an intervention scheme for public-interest goods (health-related products, energy efficient appliances, etc.).  We consider a system composed of a newsvendor firm that is subject to random supply and a central authority with fixed budget.  The central authority regulates the system by two intervention tools: advertising, and research and development investments.  We use bi-level programming for modeling the system and provide some structural properties.</br>
