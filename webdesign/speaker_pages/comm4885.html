<br>Title: Robust Parameter Design for Quality Variables and Reliability Measures</br><br>Author: Lingyan Ruan, Ph.D. Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 765 Ferst Drive, box 0205, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, gth668y@mail.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jye-Chyi (JC) Lu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The literature in design of experiment (DOE) considering both quality and reliability metrics is scarce. Although product reliability is as important as quality, especially for electronic or semiconductor devices, robust parameter designs (RPD) are primarily applied to quality measures. Moreover, typical DOE for accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) does not explore impact of changing manufacturing conditions on product reliability.  This article develops DOE plans for manufacturing variables and ADT conditions to minimize variance of parameter estimates and RPD optimizations for selecting controllable manufacturing variables to achieve longest product lifetime and reduce variations induced by environmental noise.</br>
