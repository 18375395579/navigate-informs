Title: Using a Math-heuristic to Optimize Mixed Model Assembly Lines in Low-volume Manufacturing<br>Author: Alexander Biele, EADS Innovation Works, Neﬂpriel 1, Hamburg, 21129, Germany, Alexander.Biele@eads.net<br>Coauthor(s): Lars Moench<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An optimization problem for mixed model assembly lines in the aerospace industry is researched. We minimize the total inventory and labor costs of an assembly line assuming a given job (airplane) sequence. A VNS approach is used to find an appropriate number of workers for each station and cycle times for jobs on stations. The evaluation of a move requires the solution of a linear program to determine the start dates for the jobs. Results of computational experiments are presented.
