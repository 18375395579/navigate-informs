Title: Robust Wind Farm Layout Optimization with Mixed Integer Programming<br>Author: Peter Y.

However, the latter is inherently uncertain due to errors in measurement, correlation, and forecasting. Previous studies on wind farm optimization assumed wind data to be perfectly accurate, which could lead to lower investor confidence and higher financial risk. This study presents a novel Robust MIP model to address such gap.
