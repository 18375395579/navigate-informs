<br>Title: Continuous Approximation Modeling for Mixed Load School Bus Routing</br><br>Author: William Ellegood, University of Missouri-St. Louis, College of Business Administration, St. Louis, MO, 63121, United States of America, wevf6@mail.umsl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Campbell, Jeremy North</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: School bus transportation is an expensive and challenging mandated service in rural and semi-rural public school districts. We develop continuous approximation models of bus routes to analyze the potential for reducing travel distance with mixed loads of students (i.e. students for different schools are carried on the same bus) and consolidation of bus stops. Results document the savings as a function of the district shape, the distribution of students and bus stops, and the routing policy.</br>
