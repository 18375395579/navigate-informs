Recent work derives estimators through Malliavin calculus but requires heavy mathematics.  In this article we investigate connections between Malliavin estimators and the traditional and elementary pathwise method and likelihood ratio method. In several cases time-averaging of multiple estimators is key in achieving convergence to the continuous-time limit.</br>
