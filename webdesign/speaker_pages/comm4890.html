Title: Malliavin Greeks Without Malliavin Calculus<br>Author: Nan Chen, Chinese University of Hong Kong, 709A,  William Mong Engineering Building, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong - ROC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Glasserman<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We derive and analyze Monte Carlo estimators of price sensitivities (``Greeks'') for contingent claims priced in a diffusion model.  Recent work derives estimators through Malliavin calculus but requires heavy mathematics.  In this article we investigate connections between Malliavin estimators and the traditional and elementary pathwise method and likelihood ratio method. In several cases time-averaging of multiple estimators is key in achieving convergence to the continuous-time limit.
