Title: Random Utility Theory Without Utility<br>Author: Bob Bordley, General Motors Operations Research, M/C 480-106-256, 30500 Mound Road, Warren, MI, 48090, United States, robert.bordley@gm.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Models of customer choice usually assume that customers maximize utility, even though empirical evidence has refuted this assumption.  This paper establishes that these same market models can be derived without any assumption of utility-maximization (and without using the concept of utility).
