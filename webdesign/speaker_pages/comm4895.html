<br>Title: A Stochastic Programming Based Approach to Assemble-to-order Inventory Systems</br><br>Author: Martin Reiman, Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, 600 Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ, 07974, United States of America, marty@research.bell-labs.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The assemble-to-order system is a classical model in inventory theory. The optimal control for this system is known only for some very special cases. I will describe an approach to this problem based on a stochastic program (SP) that provides a lower bound on achievable cost. I will then describe how to translate the solution of this SP into a control policy, and present a proof of asymptotic optimality of this control policy.
