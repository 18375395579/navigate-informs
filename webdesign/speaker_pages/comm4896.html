Title: Services Costing in a Complex Environment: A Hierarchical Dichotomy<br>Author: Toby Lehman, Research Staff Member, IBM Research, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, CA, 95120, United States of America, toby@almaden.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Greg Eyres<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Costing requires adopting one of two opposing modeling methodologies: tops-down or bottoms-up.  Tops-down provides a quick turn-around for estimates, but bottoms-up provides a more accuracy.  The ideal solution is to take the benefits of each method without incurring any of the problems.  We present a mechanism that balances the two approaches and derives benefits from both.
