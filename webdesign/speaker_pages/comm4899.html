Title: Finding Low-rank Matrices via Nuclear Norm Minimization<br>Author: Maryam Fazel, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, Box 352500, Electrical Engineering Dept, Univ of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, mfazel@u.washington.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In many applications, notions of order or dimension of a model can be expressed as the rank of an appropriate matrix. Matrix rank minimization is NP-hard. We discuss a convex relaxation, minimizing the nuclear norm of the matrix, and give results on recovering the lowest rank matrix when the constraints are linear equalities and satisfy a certain isometry condition. The recovery is also robust to noise in the constraints. This talk is based on joint work with Ben Recht and Pablo Parrilo.
