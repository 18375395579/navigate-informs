<br>Title: Modeling and Forecasting Towards Adaptive Design of a System of PHEV Charging Stations</br><br>Author: Piampoom Sarikprueck, The University of Texas at Arlington, 416 Yates Street, Nedderman Hall Room 517-518, Arlington, TX, 76011, United States of America, piampoom.sarikprueck@mavs.uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei-Jen Lee, Asama Kulvanitchaiyanunt, Victoria Chen, Jay Rosenberger</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The proposed model for PHEV charging stations consists of energy resources, controller, battery, converter, and inverter. The main energy resources are utility grid integrated with wind from a single wind farm and solar energy generated at each station. The charging stations will provide DC fast charging and can sell back energy to the grid. Forecasting results of wind and solar energy as well as market prices are carried out to provide information for system design and optimal dynamic control.</br>
