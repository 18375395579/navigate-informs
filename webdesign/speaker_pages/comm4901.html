Title: Bilateral Credit Valuation Adjustment for Large Credit Derivatives Portfolios<br>Author: Agostino Capponi, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States of America, acappon1@jhu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We obtain an explicit formula for the CVA adjustment of a  credit default swaps portfolio referencing an asymptotically large number of entities.  The key insight behind our approach is an explicit characterization of the portfolio exposure as the weak limit of measure-valued processes associated to survival indicators of portfolio names.     We numerically show that CVA is highly sensitive to portfolio credit risk volatility as well as to default correlation.
