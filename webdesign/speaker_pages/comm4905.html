Title: Circle Packing Problems: Numerical Results and Applications<br>Author: Ignacio Castillo, Wilfrid Laurier University, School of Business and Economics, Waterloo, ON, Canada, icastillo@wlu.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Frank Kampas, János D. Pintér<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A circle packing is an optimized arrangement of N arbitrary sized circles inside a given container (e.g., a rectangle or a circle) such that no two circles overlap. We present several circle packing problems, review their practical applications, and some strategies for their solution. We also provide illustrative numerical examples using (our) global optimization software.
