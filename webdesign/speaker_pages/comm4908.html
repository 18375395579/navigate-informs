<br>Title: Simple and Asymptotically Optimal Policies for Capacitated Serial Systems with High Service Levels</br><br>Author: Ganesh Janakiraman, N.Y.U., gjanakir@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Woonghee Tim Huh, Mahesh Nagarajan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study a multi-echelon inventory system in series with capacity constraints at all stages. The optimal policy for this system is unknown. We propose three intuitive, echelon order-up-to policies and show that these policies are asymptotically optimal as the backorder cost parameter grows infinitely large.</br>
