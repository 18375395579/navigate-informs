Title: Using Real-time Delay Information to Prioritize Early Standby and Reaccomodation of Passengers<br>Author: Brittany Luken, Georgia Institute of Technology, 790 Atlantic Drive, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, brittany.l.luken@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Laurie Garrow<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: On average a disrupted airline passenger (from misconnect or cancellation) is delayed 8 hours.  Priority for early standby or reaccomodation of passengers is often determined by some combination of ticket fare, itinerary or frequent flyer status without regard to the likelihood of passengers getting disrupted later in their itinerary. This research illustrates how real-time delay models can be used to prioritize early standby or reaccomodation of passengers to minimize total passenger delay.
