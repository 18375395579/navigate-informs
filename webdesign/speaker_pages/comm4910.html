Title: Traffic Flow-based Analytical Model for Fleet and Buffer Sizing at Sea Container Terminals<br>Author: Debjit Roy, Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, Wing 3C, Vastrapur, India, debjit@iimahd.ernet.in<br>Coauthor(s): Akash Gupta<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: The internal transport of containers in sea container terminals is performed by a pool of vehicles that share a common guide-path. We model the congestion in the vehicle guide-path using a traffic-flow based closed queuing network model and determine the fleet and buffer size to meet throughput requirements.
