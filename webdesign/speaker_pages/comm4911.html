Title: Continuum Approximation Approach to the Reliable Facility Location Problem<br>Author: Yanfeng Ouyang, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1209 Newmark Laboratory, MC 250, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, yfouyang@uiuc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tingting Cui, Max Shen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the planar version of the uncapacitated fixed-charge location problem under probabilistic service disruptions, where customers are re-assigned if the previously assigned facilities fail. A continuum approximation (CA) approach is proposed to minimize the expected total costs (facility charges, transportation costs, and penalties for not serving customers). Numerical results show that the CA approach solves the problem effectively, and comparisons with discrete models are presented.
