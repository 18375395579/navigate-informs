Title: Modeling the C-5 Isochronal Inspection Process<br>Author: Martha Cooper, Professor of Logistics Management, AF Institute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way, Bldg 641, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, United States of America, Martha.cooper@afit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Heiman, Alan Johnson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Isochronal (ISO) inspections are a periodic examination of military aircraft health. The Air Force plans to streamline ISO flow and reduce the number of C-5 ISO inspection sites from five to three, to reduce cost and promote inspection scheduling predictability.  We use an Arena-based simulation and DOE to estimate the expected impacts to cost and fleet mission capability.
