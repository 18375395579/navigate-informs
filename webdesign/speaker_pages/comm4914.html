<br>Title: Simulation Based Optimization of Multi-Location Inventory Problems with Capacitated Transhipments</br><br>Author: Banu Ekren, Doctoral student, University of Louisville, 209, Speed Building, Dept of Industrial Engineering, Louisville, KY, 40059, United States of America, b0ekre01@louisville.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sunderesh Heragu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, an (s, S) inventory system in which the items can be stored at any of N stocking locations and shipped to the others is optimized using simulation. We consider fixed and variable ordering costs, stochastic replenishment lead times and assume that the transportation capacities at the stocking locations are bounded by transshipment policies. An ARENA 10.0 simulation model and near-optimal policies developed using the OptQuest tool in ARENA are presented.</br>
