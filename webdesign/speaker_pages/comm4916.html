The tracking error is defined as the difference between the portfolio’s return and the highest return from a set of benchmarks. We obtain the closed-form solution by linking our model to Stein's Identity. Extensive numerical tests show that our portfolio has consistent higher net Sharpe ratio and lower turnover rate than its benchmarks, in particular, the 1/n portfolio.</br>
