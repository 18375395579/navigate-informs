Title: Appointment Sequencing with Equally Spaced Appointment Times<br>Author: Boray Huang, National University of Singapore, 1 Engineering Drive 2, E1A-06-25, Singapore, Singapore, isehb@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Ahmad Reza Pourghaderi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the sequencing problem of heterogeneous punctual patients with equally spaced appointment times to minimize the expected waiting time of patients. We discuss the widely accepted conjecture that sequencing patients with smaller service time variance first is optimal. The issue of unpunctuality is also discussed. Some important insights are drawn which could be applied for the break time scheduling problem as well.
