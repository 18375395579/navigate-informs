Title: Robust Revenue Management with Hybrid Information<br>Author: Yingjie Lan, Peking University, Guanghua School of Management, Beijing, 100871, China, ylan@gsm.pku.edu.cn<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball, Itir Karaesmen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the joint decision of seat allocation and overbooking with hybrid information quality. Information with mixed quality arises as no-show records are accurate and more stable, while demand data is often censored and more volatile. We optimize the worst case performance and solve the problem as a zero-sum game. Our numerical results show the practical relevance of our method.
