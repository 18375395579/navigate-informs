Title: Scheduling Divide-and-Conquer Graphs on Parallel Processors<br>Author: Wieslaw Kubiak, Professor, Memorial University, St. John's, NL, A1B 3X5, Canada, wkubiak@mun.ca<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The problem of scheduling a set of UET tasks subject to precedence constraints on identical parallel processors is NP-hard in the strong sense. However, polynomial time algorithms exist for some classes of precedence constraints graphs. We consider a class of divide-and-conquer graphs that naturally model the execution of divide-and-conquer algorithms. We prove that the HLF strategy minimizes makespan for this class.
