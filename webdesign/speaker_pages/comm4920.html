Title: On the Maximum 2-club Problem<br>Author: Baski Balasundaram, Assistant Professor, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, baski.balasundaram@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sergiy Butenko<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A k-club is a set vertices that induce a subgraph of diameter at most k. k-clubs were originally introduced in social network analysis as clique relaxations that model cohesive subgroups.  We focus on the special case of 2-clubs. Its unique properties, complexity results and preliminary polyhedral results will be discussed.
