Title: Weakly Cooperative Systems<br>Author: David Jeffcoat, Principal Engineer, Air Force Research Lab, 101 W.

Our mathematical model is the Markov process.  We present a general framework and illustrate it on a number of search and engage systems.  Our analysis shows that the impact of cooperation on overall system performance is inherently bounded.  Finally, we introduce a measure of cooperation that enables one to quantify the “degree of cooperativeness?in a given multi-agent system.
