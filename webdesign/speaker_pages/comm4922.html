The clients are transportation disadvantaged, e.g. handicapped, elderly, mentally disabled. There are two route categories, fixed and on-demand. There are special constraints in addition to classical vehicle routing problem with time windows. Developed algorithms are based on cheapest insertion and tabu search heuristics. The algorithms are used for both static(offline) and dynamic(online) planning of the routes.</br>
