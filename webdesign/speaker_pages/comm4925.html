Title: Spatio-temporal Optimization for Multi-object Search and Identification<br>Author: Timothy Chung, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Dept., 1411 Cunningham Road, Gl-261, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, thchung@nps.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Moshe Kress, Johannes Royset<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Consider a spatial region in which many dynamic agents (both true targets and neutral objects) are present and undergoing different stochastic motion models, respectively.  Uncertain observations from multiple sensing modalities are fused to provide different levels and types of information. This work proposes an algorithm for optimal allocation of sensing resources in the presence of uncertainty and dynamic constraints which yields maximal probability of identification of true targets.
