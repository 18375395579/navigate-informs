Instead, I only assume that bidders are risk averse and the good being sold is a normal good. This leads to qualitatively different solutions to the auction design problem. Specifically, the auctioneer should use randomization to better exploit features of bidder risk preferences. I show that allowing randomization will improve efficiency and increase revenues.</br>
