Title: Auction Design without Quasilinear Preferences<br>Author: Brian Baisa, Amherst College, Amherst, MA, United States of America, bhbaisa@gmail.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: I analyze auction design in a private value setting and remove the standard restriction that bidders?preferences are quasilinear. Instead, I only assume that bidders are risk averse and the good being sold is a normal good. This leads to qualitatively different solutions to the auction design problem. Specifically, the auctioneer should use randomization to better exploit features of bidder risk preferences. I show that allowing randomization will improve efficiency and increase revenues.
