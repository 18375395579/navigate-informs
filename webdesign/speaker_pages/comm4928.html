Current focus is on the development of models to efficiently estimate the number of crew needed to fly a schedule, approximate the cost of crew ladders (or how crew are promoted through the ranks), and estimate the benefits (as related to crew) of mixed fleet flying under irregular operations.  An overview of the activities in these three areas will be given.</br>
