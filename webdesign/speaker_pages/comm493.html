Title: Inventory Monitoring in Micro-retailing<br>Author: Margaret Aksoy-Pierson, Assistant Professor, Dartmouth College, Tuck School of Business, 100 Tuck Hall, Hanover, NH, 03766, United States of America, mpierson@dartmouth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin, Juan Chaneton<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a procedure for predicting out-of-stock products in a retail store using only point of sale transaction data, without inventory levels or in-bound delivery data. We postulate a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) incorporating inventory status and purchase behavior. The procedure is validated with data from micro-retailers in Mexico.
