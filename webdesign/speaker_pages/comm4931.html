<br>Title: Modularity and Redesign of Components in Complex Products</br><br>Author: Manuel Sosa, Assistant Professor of Technology and Operations Management, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, manuel.sosa@insead.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Using a network approach we define modularity of product components based on their lack of connectivity with other components in the product. Component redesign is defined as the proportion of component design content that is not carried over from previous product generations. We test two competing propositions about the impact of component modularity on component redesign by analyzing the design of a large commercial aircraft engine.</br>
