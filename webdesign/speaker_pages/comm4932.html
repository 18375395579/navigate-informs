Title: Correcting Flight Exemption Bias in Ground Delay Programs<br>Author: Michael Brennan, Chief Scientist, Metron Aviation, Inc., 131 Elden Street, Herndon, VA, 20170, United States of America, brennan@metronaviation.com<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: When executing Ground Delay Programs for airports FAA traffic managers often hedge against uncertain weather by exempting long-distance flights from imposed delays. This introduces an inequitable distribution of delay among carriers. We describe here a Lagrangian relaxation approach to providing equity for all carriers while hedging against risk.
