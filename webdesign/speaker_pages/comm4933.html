Title: Interactive Location Decisions: An Airport Example<br>Author: Yupo Chan, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, 2801 South University, Little Rock, AR, 72204, United States of America, yxchan@ualr.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Using airport location as an example, an interactive multicriteria decision-process is discussed. Without specifying the utility/value function, the tradeoff between travel time and noise impact is accomplished using a Frank-Wolfe optimization procedure. Computational results for both network location and planar location problems are presented, which are shown to be consistent with existing theories in continuous and discrete location.
