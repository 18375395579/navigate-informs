Title: A Sampling-based Approach  to Appointment Scheduling<br>Author: Mehmet Begen, PhD Candidate, Sauder School of Business,  University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z2, Canada, mehmet.begen@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi, Maurice Queyranne<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the appointment scheduling problem with discrete random durations, studied by Begen and Queyranne, but without assuming the knowledge of the job duration distributions. Instead, information on the duration distributions may be obtained by random sampling. We show that the objective function is convex under a simple condition and characterize its subdifferential, and determine the number of independent samples required to obtain a provably near-optimal solution with high probability.
