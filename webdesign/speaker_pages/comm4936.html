Title: Reconciling Support Theory and the Book-making Principle<br>Author: Enrico Diecidue, INSEAD, Blv de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, enrico.diecidue@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dolchai La-ornual<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Support theory postulates that probability judgments for uncertain events depend on the description of events.  We show that the theory violates basic consistency requirements for decision under uncertainty. We illustrate how support theory’s incoherence stems from its assumption of non-extensionality rather than subadditivity. We propose a relaxation of the book-making principle, a famous consistency argument, and bridge the descriptively appealing support theory with normative criteria.
