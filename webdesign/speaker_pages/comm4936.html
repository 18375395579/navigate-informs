We show that the theory violates basic consistency requirements for decision under uncertainty. We illustrate how support theory’s incoherence stems from its assumption of non-extensionality rather than subadditivity. We propose a relaxation of the book-making principle, a famous consistency argument, and bridge the descriptively appealing support theory with normative criteria.</br>
