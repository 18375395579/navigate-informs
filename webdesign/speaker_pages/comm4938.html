<br>Title: Promising Delivery Dates by Multi-objective Optimization under Stochastic Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Tobias Winkelkotte, Deutsche Post Chair of Optimization of Distribution Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Templergraben 64, Aachen, 52062, Germany, winkelkotte@or.rwth-aachen.de</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Promising delivery dates requires considering many conflicting aspects. On the one side customers expect an early delivery. On the other side the delivery time should not be too short to avoid backlogs and to reduce stocks. Since lead times are stochastic, the factors are measured by metrics depending on a service level that describes the probability of in-time-delivery. We search for a service level that optimizes all aspects by multi-criteria optimization to promise a reliable delivery date.</br>
