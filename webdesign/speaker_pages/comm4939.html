Title: Mechatronics and Metrology for Nanomanufacturing<br>Author: Jingyan Dong, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Systems Engineering, North Carolina State University, 414-C Daniels Hall, Campus Box 7906, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, jdong@ncsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Placid Ferreira<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Progresses in nanotechnologies impose critical requirements of high accurate, high repeatable nanomanfacturing systems. As novel process designs involve large-scale integrations of nano, micro and macro structures, the ability to position, manipulate and sense across multidimensional scales becomes extremely important. Technologies including nanopositioning, control, sensing and calibration are key factors to bridging the gap between emerging nanotechnologies and their manufacturing potential.
