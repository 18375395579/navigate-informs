<br>Title: A Nash Bargaining Solution for Partition of Jobs Between Two Manufacturers</br><br>Author: Xiaoqiang Cai, Professor, Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong - ROC, xqcai@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Quanle Chen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Two manufacturers negotiate to partition a set of jobs that they have jointly obtained.  Each manufacturer has his own processing capacity and setting, and thus has to look for the best schedule for his processing given any subset of jobs that he may get.  We develop an algorithm, and show that it can derive the best solution to partition the jobs in a mutually acceptable and beneficial manner.</br>
