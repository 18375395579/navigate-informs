Our model  considers a wide range of inputs, including stochastic interest rates,  demand for the asset, and random shocks to observe the sale process at  the micro level. The holder of the asset makes optimal decisions in  the face of changing market conditions by considering the level of  interest rates, demand and keeping the asset in the sale market for  optimal amount of time.</br>
