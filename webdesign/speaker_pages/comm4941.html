The criteria for optimal hedging is determined by a suitable convex risk measure. Under some assumptions on the set of trading strategies, we prove the existence of optimal hedging strategies and we give an expression for the minimum capital requirement. Applied to the framework of shortfall risk, it provides a bridge to minimal variance pricing.</br>
