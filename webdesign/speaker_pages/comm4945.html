<br>Title: Modeling the Relationships between Quality, Time, and Cost in Project Management Decision Making</br><br>Author: Bruce Polack-Johnson, Villanova University, Department of Math. Sci., 800 Lancaster Ave, Villanova, PA, United States of America, bruce.polack-johnson@villanova.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Liberatore</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a mathematical programming model that considers quality explicitly in project planning and scheduling, while addressing the tradeoffs between quality, time, and cost.  Using a construction example we show how this model can generate quality level curves to illustrate the trade-offs among time, cost, and quality.</br>
