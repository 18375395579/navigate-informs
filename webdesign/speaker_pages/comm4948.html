Title: Multi-objective Optimization of a Warehouse in Pharmaceutical and Cosmetics Industry.<br>Author: Luis Ramirez, FCIMEC, Carrera 53 No.74-86 Office 402, Barranquilla, At, 080020, Colombia, lramirez@fcimec.org<br>Coauthor(s): Miguel Jimenez, Erik Maldonado, Fernando Gonzalez, Diana Ramirez, Lauren Castro<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An a approach to a typical warehouse problem was considered by using both heuristics and metaheuristics,  were efficiency is given by the best arrangement of items in the warehouse (slotting) and the best picking routes selected for each order (picking). Through the integration of both simulation and optimization models, a computational procedure was developed, were the results consider a significant increase in the picking and slotting processes of the warehouse.
