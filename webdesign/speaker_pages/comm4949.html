Title: Diffusion Approximations for Chat Service Systems<br>Author: Leon Cui, University of Rochester, 620 University Park, Rochester, 14620, United States of America, leon.cui@simon.rochester.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tolga Tezcan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we study a queueing model of customer service chat (CSC) systems. A unique feature of these queueing systems is that a single agent can serve multiple customers simultaneously. Under diffusion scaling, we prove the convergence of the queueing process to a simple stochastic differential equation in a many server heavy-traffic regime and use the result to estimate the number of customers in the system and the sojourn time of a customer.
