A unique feature of these queueing systems is that a single agent can serve multiple customers simultaneously. Under diffusion scaling, we prove the convergence of the queueing process to a simple stochastic differential equation in a many server heavy-traffic regime and use the result to estimate the number of customers in the system and the sojourn time of a customer.</br>
