<br>Title: Matroids, Secretary Problems, and Online Mechanisms</br><br>Author: Moshe Babaioff, Researcher, Microsoft Research, 1065 La Avenida St., Mountain View, CA, 94043, United States of America, moshe@microsoft.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicole Immorlica, Robert Kleinberg</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We design online approximation mechanisms for various combinatorial problems in which agents arrive in random order, based on generalizations of the well known secretary problem.  In particular, we present a truthful competitive auction for the unit-demand domain, in which there is a finite set of goods for sale and each agent wants to receive one good from a specified subset of goods.</br>
