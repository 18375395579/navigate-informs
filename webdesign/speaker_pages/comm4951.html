Title: Stochastic and Dynamic Shipper Carrier Network Design Problem<br>Author: Avinash Unnikrishnan, Graduate Student, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, avinash@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Travis Waller<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The focus of this work is to determine the optimal storage capacity to be installed on transshipment nodes by shippers in a dynamic shipper carrier network under stochastic demand. A two stage mathematical program with recourse formulation is developed where in the first stage, the shipper decides the optimal capacity to be installed on transshipment nodes. In the second stage, the shipper chooses a routing strategy based on the realized demand.
