Title: Flexible Network Design with Demand Elasticity and Income Effect<br>Author: Gopal Patil, PhD Candidate, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, JEC-4002, Dept of Civil Engineering, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, patilg@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Flexible network design problem (FNDP) is a multi-stage network improvements problem where the decision makers get options of changing, delaying, or canceling the future improvements under network uncertainty. Improvements reduce travel costs which will have impact on network demand and travelers income. In this study we incorporate demand elasticity and income effect of network improvements.
