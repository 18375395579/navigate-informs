<br>Title: Achieving Capacity in Finite-Buffer Wireless Networks</br><br>Author: Peter Momcilovic, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 1301 Beal Avenue, 4211 EECS, Ann Arbor, 48109, United States, petar@eecs.umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Predrag Jelenkovic, Mark Squillante</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the existence of protocols that can achieve the capacity limit in a large, growing wireless network with the fixed buffer space in each node. The goal is to maximize the network throughput in the presence of packet losses caused by limited buffer space. We establish that the network cannot operate at its capacity limit with a finite buffer in each node. However, somewhat unexpectedly, we construct a protocol that obtains just a slightly smaller throughput even with very small buffers.</br>
