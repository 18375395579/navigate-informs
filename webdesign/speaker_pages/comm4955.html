<br>Title: Option Pricing by Fast Convolution Transform</br><br>Author: Shi-Jie Deng, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, deng@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jingfang Huang, Yuanqing LI</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Financial option pricing problems often boils down to the computation of the probability density function convoluting with given distributions using N discretized points. We propose a scheme which approximates the probability density function utilizing the Fourier series expansion and sums of the double exponential distributions. A recursive relation is derived for each term which reduces the total amount of computational work from O(N^2) to the asymptotically optimal O(N).</br>
