<br>Title: A Two-sided GridPick System</br><br>Author: Kevin R. Gue, Associate Professor, Auburn University, Shelby Center Room 3314, Auburn, AL, 36832, United States of America, GUEKEVI@auburn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Onur Uludag</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: GridPick is a high-density, puzzle-based order picking system that moves items to and away from the pick face dynamically.  The benefit is having effectively more than one sku per picking slot, which reduces walking time to build orders.  In this talk, we present a two-sided system in which workers can pick from the North and South sides of the grid at the same time.</br>
