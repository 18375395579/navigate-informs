Title: Dynamic Empty Car Management in Railyards<br>Author: Tolga Bektas, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Universite de Montreal, Centre de Recherche sur les Transports, CP 6128, Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 3J7, Canada, tolga@crt.umontreal.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Teodor Gabriel Crainic<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper is concerned with accelerating the flow of empty cars in a major classification railyard in North America. Due to fluctations in inbound traffic, empty cars experience long delays at the yard. Such delays can be prevented by dynamic car reassignments. We describe a procedure using a sliding time window in order to reduce the time that empty cars spend in the yard and present the associated computational results.
