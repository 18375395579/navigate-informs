Title: Optimal Product Portfolio Decisions For Fusion Products with N Functions<br>Author: Yuwen Chen, Ph.D Student, University of Florida, PO Box 117169, Gainesville, FL, 32601, United States, yuwen@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Sin, Janice Carrillo, Asoo Vakharia<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate the manufacturer's optimal product portfolio decision under assumptions of linear price-demand relationship and demand substitution. The product portfolio decision is very complex, we create an algorithm which efficiently identifies the optimal solution based on the concavity property for the objective function. Numerical results show that the manufacturer should often select only a subset of fusion and single-function products to satisfy the market's multi-dimension needs.
