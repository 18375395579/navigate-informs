Title: Product Architecture Modularity Measurement with Stochastic Modeling<br>Author: Juliana Hsuan, Associate Professor, PhD, Copenhagen Business School, Solbjerg Plads 3, DK-2000  Frederiksberg, Coppenhagen, Denmark, jh.om@cbs.dk<br>Coauthor(s): Eric Bentzen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Due to the combinatorial properties of modularity, customer demand for customization is assumed to be stochastic (as opposed to deterministic). Competitive properties of product architecture modularity include the degree of novelty, interface standardization, substitutability, and degree of coupling. We explore the stochastic properties of these elements in modularity.
