The time required to recharge can be significant compared to the total trip time, and the charge rate at a given charging station depends on the station’s voltage and the vehicle’s charge level.  In addition, battery health must be preserved.  We model the problem of coordinating routing and recharging decisions for EVs as a dynamic program and present several solution algorithms and their analyses.</br>
