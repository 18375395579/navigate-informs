Our algorithm selects the location and frequency assignment of access points in an attempt to maximize the expected network capacity. Our algorithm has been empirically tested on three buildings on the campus of Southern Methodist University. Comparison of our designs with those developed by local IT personnel yielded improvements of 20%, 33%, and 33%.</br>
