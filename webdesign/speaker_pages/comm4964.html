Title: Strong Duality and a Dual Method for Nonconvex Spectrum Optimization of Multicarrier Systems<br>Author: Tamas Terlaky, McMaster University, Department of Computing and Software, Hamilton, ON, Canada, terlaky@mcmaster.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Jiaping Zhu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Yu and Liu's strong duality theorem under the time-sharing property requires the Slater condition to hold for the considered general nonconvex problem, what is satisfied for the specific application. We further extend the scope of  the theorem under Ky Fan convexity which is slightly weaker than Yu&Lui's time-sharing property.
