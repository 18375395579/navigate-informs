Title: 2006 Winner: Variable-number Sample-path Optimization<br>Author: Michael Ferris, Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Department of Computer Sciences, 1210 West Dayton Street, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, ferris@cs.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Geng Deng<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The sample-path method approximates the expected simulation output by the average of sample observations with a common random number sequence. We describe a new variant of the UOBYQA algorithm (Unconstrained Optimization BY Quadratic Approximation), which integrates a Bayesian Variable-Number Sample-Path scheme to choose appropriate number of samples. The statistically accurate scheme determines the number of simulation runs, and guarantees the global convergence of the algorithm.
