Title: Blocking Probabilities in Capacitated Loss Systems with Variable Demands<br>Author: Yingdong Lu, Dr., IBM Research, IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, yingdong@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ana Radovanovic<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Loss network models have become popular in the analysis of service systems. However, computing customer blocking probabilities explicitely becomes intractable even for small capacities. Using compund point processes to capture stochastic variability in the request process, we derive simple asymptotic expressions for blocking probabilities even for loss networks with very complicated topologies. We discuss interesting extensions and demonstrate accuracy of the derived formulas.
