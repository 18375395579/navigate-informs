<br>Title: Learning Based Construction of Efficient Parallel Decision Trees</br><br>Author: Chavatzelet Tryster, Tel Aviv University, Hankin 2/11, Ra'anana, 43213, Israel, cdatryster@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Irad Ben-Gal</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose an algorithm for the construction of efficient coding/decision trees with an objective function of minimizing the average code length. The algorithm has a number of positive points, namely, a non-increasing monotonous efficiency function, and the possibility of taking advantage of parallel processing.</br>
