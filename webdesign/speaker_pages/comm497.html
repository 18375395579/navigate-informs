<br>Title: Competitive Bioenergy Facility Location Design under Probabilistic Disruptions</br><br>Author: Xin Wang, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 111 E Healey St Apt 202, Champaign, Il, 61820, United States of America, wangxin1@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yanfeng Ouyang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Built supply chain facilities may lose functionality due to the competitions or probabilistic disruptions. We formulate a Stackelberg game model based on continuum approximation to comprehensively analyze the problem and find the optimal facility location design under spatial competitions, facility disruptions, and general transportation cost functions. A case study with the bioenergy industry is presented.</br>
