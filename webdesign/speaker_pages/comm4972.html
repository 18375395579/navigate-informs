Title: Cooperation in Service Systems<br>Author: Shoshana Anily, Professor, Tel Aviv University, Faculty of Management, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel, anily@post.tau.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Moshe Haviv<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider M/M/1 service systems which can cooperate to generate a single pooled server. The cost of any coalition of servers is the mean number of customers in steady-state in that system. As the total cost is minimized by the grand coalition, we ask how to allocate it among the servers. We define a transferable utility cooperative game whose players are the servers, and show that its core is infinitely large; all of this albeit the fact that it is neither a monotone nor a concave game.
