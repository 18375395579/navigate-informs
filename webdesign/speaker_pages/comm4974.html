Title: Design and Management of Preventive Healthcare Facility Networks<br>Author: Yue Zhang, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Stree West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, yue.zhang3@mail.mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Vedat Verter, Oded Berman<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper provides a methodology for designing a preventive healthcare facility network so as to maximize participation. Each client would patronize the facility with minimum expected total time. The expected number of participants decreases with the expected total time. The facilities cannot be operated unless participation exceeds a requirement. Since the formulation is highly nonlinear, we provide a heuristic solution framework. Finally, a real life application in Montreal is investigated.
