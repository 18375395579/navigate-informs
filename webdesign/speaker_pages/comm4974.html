Each client would patronize the facility with minimum expected total time. The expected number of participants decreases with the expected total time. The facilities cannot be operated unless participation exceeds a requirement. Since the formulation is highly nonlinear, we provide a heuristic solution framework. Finally, a real life application in Montreal is investigated.</br>
