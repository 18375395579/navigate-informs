<br>Title: Pricing Queued Services</br><br>Author: Parijat Dube, IBM  T J Watson Research Center, 19 Skyline Drive, Hawthorne, NY, United States of America, pdube@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rahul Jain</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop a framework to study introduction of differentiated services. We consider the pricing problem when there are multiple providers and study the pricing game for queued services with QoS-sensitive customers. We show existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium under standard assumptions. We give sufficient conditions for social optimality of the equilibrium.</br>
