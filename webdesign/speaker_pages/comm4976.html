Title: Approximating Time-Dependent  Ph_t  and  MAP_t  Queueing-Models<br>Author: Michael Taaffe, Graduate Program Director, Associate Professor, The Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Durham Hall, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States, taaffe@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Walid Nasr, Javier Rueda<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We develop numerical methods based on partial-moment differential equations and closure approximations for time-dependent moments of the system state and the distribution function and moments of virtual sojourn time for queueing nodes having Ph_t, MAP_t, and MSP_t arrival/service processes. We discuss our approximation for [M_t/M_t/s]^K queueing networks. We also allow for time-based control of system parameters (number of servers and queue capacity) and entity arrivals/deletions.
