Title: Importance Sampling for Jackson Networks<br>Author: Hui Wang, Associate Professor, Brown University, 182 George Street, Providence, RI, United States of America, huiwang@dam.brown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Dupuis<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We construct simple and efficient state-dependent importance sampling for simulating buffer overflows in Jackson networks. The scheme is universal in that the sampling distributions do not depend on the particular event of interest. We also identify the minimizing   trajectory for the calculus of variation problem that is associated   with the sample-path large deviation rate function.
