<br>Title: Freight Option-based Collaboration for Multiple Less-than-Truckload Carrier Logistics</br><br>Author: Choungryeol Lee, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, School of Civil Engineering, West Lafayette, IN, 47906-2051, United States of America, lee1210@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for enabling collaborative multiple-carriers logistics in the less-than-truckload (LTL) industry. It is an option-based paradigm where LTL carriers autonomously hedge the risks faced in terms of capacity utilization and demand variability in an operational context. Numerical experiments illustrate that carrier-carrier collaboration with freight options has the potential to enhance the reliability and resilience of the LTL freight system.</br>
