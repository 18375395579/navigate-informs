<br>Title: Preventative Maintenance of Water Distribution Systems</br><br>Author: Yonatan Gebre, Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, IL, United States of America, jgebre@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yada Zhu, Honggang Wang, Xin Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Water distribution systems (WDS) are a type of spatially organized systems in which components (nodes) are connected by pipes (links). To control a WDS with limited resources, critical nodes and links are identified for maintenance using efficient algorithms. Simulation optimization is applied to validate the algorithms.</br>
