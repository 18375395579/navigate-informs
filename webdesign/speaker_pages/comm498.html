<br>Title: On the Minimal Invariance Entropy of a Subspace for Multi-channel Systems</br><br>Author: Getachew Befecadu, Research Assistant Professor, University of Notre Dame, Department of Electrical Engineering, Cushing Hall 221, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, United States of America, gbefekadu1@nd.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate a Nash equilibrium in feedback strategies that imposes minimal dynamics, in the sense of minimal invariance entropy of a given subspace, for multi-channel systems. We present a sufficient condition for the existence of Nash equilibria, when the criterion is the minimal invariance entropy of a given subspace. Such an interpretation offers an intrinsic measure of information how is difficult to keep the system states near a given subspace with respect to the control input channels.</br>
