<br>Title: Comments on the Complexity of Revenue Maximization under Two Movie-screening Policies</br><br>Author: Tharanga Rajapakshe, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 West Campbell Road, Richardson, Tx, 75080-3021, United States of America, tharanga@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Milind Dawande, Chelliah Sriskandarajah, Inna Drobouchevitch</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of the selection and scheduling of movies for a multiplex to maximize the exhibitor's cumulative revenue over a fixed planning horizon. We investigate two popular screening policies: preempt-resume and non-preempt. We show that the problem of optimizing under the non-preempt policy is polynomially solvable while that under the preempt-resume policy is strongly NP-hard. Using a comprehensive test bed of realistic instances, we compare the revenues from these two policies.</br>
