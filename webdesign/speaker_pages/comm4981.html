We propose a sequential decision rule that declares and identifies a change as soon as the posterior probability of a change type exceeds some fixed threshold.  We show that the rule is asymptotically optimal under Bayesian and fixed-error formulations as the unit sampling cost and misdiagnosis probability go to zero, respectively.</br>
