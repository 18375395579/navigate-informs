<br>Title: Transmission Switching in Electric Grids with Uncertain Line Failures</br><br>Author: Oleg Shirokikh, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, olegshirokikh@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexey Sorokin, Vladimir Boginski</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying a cost-efficient strategy for transmission line switching in electric grids under risk considerations associated with uncertain failures of multiple lines (arcs) in the network. Conditional Value-at-Risk constraints are utilized to restrict potential losses associated with failure scenarios.</br>
