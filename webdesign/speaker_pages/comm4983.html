Title: Robust Portfolio Liquidation with Margin Requirement<br>Author: Jingnan Chen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, United States of America, jchen98@illinois.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the robust portfolio liquidation with margin requirement. An optimal execution strategy is in the sense that we can meet the cash requirement with the least effort. We first focus on selling a portfolio of purely basic assets. Then we extend to the portfolio consisting of both basic assets and the derivatives.
