Title: Routing for Relief Efforts<br>Author: Ann Campbell, Associate Professor, Department of Management Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, ann-campbell@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dieter Vandenbussche, William Hermann<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The routing problems inspired by disaster relief require new methodologies.  We focus on alternative objective functions including minimizing the maximum arrival time and minimizing the average arrival time.  We bound the worst case performance of optimal VRP solutions with respect to these new variants.  We also present solution approaches for these two variants and use these in computational experiments to evaluate average cost/service tradeoffs.
