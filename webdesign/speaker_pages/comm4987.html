They support differentiation to evaluate the effect of moves performed within a local search procedure. The benefits of differentiable invariants are illustrated on a number of applications which feature complex, possibly  reified, expressions and whose models are essentially similar to their CP counterparts. Experimental results demonstrate their practicability.</br>
