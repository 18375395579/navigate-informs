Title: Differentiability in Constraint-Based Local Search<br>Author: Laurent Michel, Assistant Professor, Computer Science & Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States, ldm@engr.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pascal Van Hentenryck<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Differentiable invariants are generic structures that maintain the value of arbitrary expressions and their variable gradients. They support differentiation to evaluate the effect of moves performed within a local search procedure. The benefits of differentiable invariants are illustrated on a number of applications which feature complex, possibly  reified, expressions and whose models are essentially similar to their CP counterparts. Experimental results demonstrate their practicability.
