Title: A Multi-Criteria Collaborative Optimization Algorithm for Supply Chains with Multiple Decision Maker<br>Author: Atul Rangarajan, Department of Industrial & Manufacturing Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, 310 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, aur114@psu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a multi-criteria (MC), multiple decision maker decentralized supply chain (SC) inventory model with an arborescent SC network. The criteria are average inventory capital and number of orders per year. We prove that the MC SC inventory problem may result in a dominated solution under the decentralized structure. A collaborative and interactive optimization algorithm is presented that guides firms to a compromise solution that is individually and SC efficient.
