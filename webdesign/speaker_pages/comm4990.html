We study the problem of locating ambulances and emergency helicopters under changing weather/visibility conditions, and whether to redeploy the helicopters at different states of the system.  We consider three coverage types: only ground, only air, and joint ground-air.  Objective is to maximize accident coverage at each state without exceeding relocation cost limit.</br>
