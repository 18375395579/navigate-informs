<br>Title: A Multiclass Queueing Model of Limit Orders</br><br>Author: Arseniy Kukanov, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, 544 West 113 Street, 2R, New York, NY, 10025, United States of America, arseniy.kukanov@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Costis Maglaras</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In modern electronic markets, heterogeneous agents submit limit orders to a centralized order book, which can be represented as a queueing system. The heterogeneity of orders and their interaction within a single order queue results in exceptionally long execution delays (waiting times) for large queues and anomalous bursts of activity for small queues. We develop a two-class model of an order queue at the best bid (or offer) of an exchange and show that it adequately captures such behavior.</br>
