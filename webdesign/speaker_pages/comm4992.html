<br>Title: Overloaded Service System with Scoring-Based Priority Rules</br><br>Author: Yichuan Ding, University of British Columbia, 4735 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, V6T1C3, Canada, Daniel.Ding@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Glynn, Stefanos Zenios</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a service system with multitype customers and service providers. Whenever a service provider tries to deliver service, each customer is assigned a score that depends on customer type, duration of waiting time, and server type. The service is then provided to the customer with the highest score. We approximate the behavior of such a system using a fluid limit process, and characterize its steady-state as well as transient behavior using combinatorial optimization methods.</br>
