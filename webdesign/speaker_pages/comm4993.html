Title: Non-stationary Online Stochastic Optimization<br>Author: Yonatan Gur, Columbia Business School, New York, NY, United States of America, ygur14@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Omar Besbes, Assaf Zeevi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic approximation problem where the underlying response function can exhibit a broad array of temporal changes. We introduce a principle by which policies that are designed for adversarial environments can be systematically adapted to non-stationary stochastic environments (by judicious choice of tuning parameters) and exhibit essentially optimal performance.
