Title: Accurate Lead Time Demand Modeling in Coordinated Supply Chains<br>Author: Barry Cobb, Virginia Military Institute, 334 Scott Shipp Hall, Economics and Business, Lexington, VA, 24450, United States of America, cobbbr@vmi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Johnson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Under uncertain demand, a mixture distribution approach can be used to model lead time demand in a two-level supply chain.  Using this technique, incentives that allow the members to divide the cost savings resulting from coordinating their inventory policies can be determined without assuming normally distributed demand.
