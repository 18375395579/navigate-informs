Title: Design of Risk Weights<br>Author: Wanmo Kang, Professor, KAIST, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of, wanmo.kang@kaist.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Glasserman<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Bank capital requirements are defined through bounds on risk-weighted assets. We investigate the effectiveness of such linear constraints in limiting portfolio risk and aligning regulatory and private objectives. We derive optimal weights and an adaptive implementation in which the regulator adjusts weights to changes in bank assets. We also derive macroprudential risk weights to mitigate procyclicality and analyze the use of a single weight vector to multiple banks with a concentration penalty.
