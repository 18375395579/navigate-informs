Title: Optimal Capacity Investment of a Multiple Channel Service Delivery System<br>Author: Jun Zhang, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, Richardson, TX, United States, jun.zhang@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mei Xue<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the optimal capacity investment problem of a multiple channel service delivery system that consists of a physical employee- serviced channel and one substitutable virtual self-serviced channel. The service times of different channels are a critical factor that drives customer’s channel choices. We found that, contradictory to the commonly held intuition, the firm should invest more on the virtual-service channel when customers?service requests are more customized.
