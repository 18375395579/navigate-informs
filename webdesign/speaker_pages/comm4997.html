Title: Operational Statistics for the Risk-averse Newsvendor Problem<br>Author: Mengshi Lu, University of California, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1777, United States of America, mengshi@berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): George Shanthikumar, Z. Max Shen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the risk-averse newsvendor problem under the conditional value-at-risk criterion with unknown demand parameter. We use the operational statistics approach to integrate parameter estimation and optimization, and show that operational statistics achieves higher expected utility than the separated approach. We also found that using operational statistics brings larger benefit when the risk associated with demand uncertainty and demand sampling is higher.
