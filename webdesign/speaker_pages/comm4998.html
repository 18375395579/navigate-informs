Title: A New Old Method for Calculating Order-up-to Levels for Transshipment Problems<br>Author: Yale Herer, Technion, Haifa, Israel, yale@technion.ac.il<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of calculating optimal order-up-to levels for the multi-location periodic stochastic inventory problem with transshipments. In the past, these levels were calculated by differentiating the expected profit function. We demonstrate how an old idea for the single location version of the problem can be used to solve our problem.
