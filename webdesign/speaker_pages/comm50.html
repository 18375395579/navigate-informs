<br>Title: Fighting Market Power by Auctioning Generation: How Much, How Often? A System Dynamics Approach</br><br>Author: Juan Jose Sanchez, IIT, Comillas University, Santa Cruz de Marcenado, 26, Madrid, Ma, 28015, Spain, JuanJose.Sanchez@iit.upcomillas.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Julian Barquin, Efraim Centeno</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The effectiveness of auctions of long-term contracts in mitigating market power is related both to the amount and to the tenor of the contracts, but there is not a consensus on the optimal figures and on the long-term effects. This paper proposes to address these issues by means of a dynamic model. In particular, a detailed realistic model of the power system, conjectured price responses computation, and forward trading with price formation based on expected spot plus risk premium are considered</br>
