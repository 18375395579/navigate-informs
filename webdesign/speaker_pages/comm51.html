The participants were presented purchase decision trials with 14 different products whose price levels were changed while their facial electromyography (EMG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) were recorded. The results suggest that low prices and national brand products induce higher positive emotions compared to high prices and private label products. Also, positive emotions are related to greater purchase intent.</br>
