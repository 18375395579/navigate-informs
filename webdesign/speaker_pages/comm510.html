<br>Title: Strategic Price Bundling in Competitive Markets: Complements, Substitutes, and Correlated Values</br><br>Author: Cary Deck, University of Arkansas, 402 WCOB, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, CDeck@walton.uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Aloysius</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study how customer product valuation affects strategic mixed bundle pricing in competitive markets where a fraction of buyers comparison shop.  The model allows for jointly distributed values where the super- or sub-additivity of the bundle (degree of substitutability or complementarity) is parameterized.  Behavioral Study 1 manipulates bundle additivity and Study 2 varies value correlation.  The impact of control variables on market outcomes is measured and the implications are discussed.</br>
