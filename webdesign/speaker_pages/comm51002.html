Professor, Baruch College, CUNY, 1 Bernard Baruch Way, New York, NY, United States of America, roumen_vragov@baruch.cuny.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Web 2.0 technologies invite new co-production modes in the cultural content industries. Using laboratory experiments we explore three markets: one with post-purchase personalization, one with reuse licenses to other producers, and one with piracy. We show that in the first two markets total surplus is larger than in the case without tradeable transmutation rights, and in the presence of piracy, efficiency gains due to trading of transmutation rights will be diminished or entirely lost.</br>
