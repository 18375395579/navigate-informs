<br>Title: Supply Function Dynamics, Equilibrium, and Local Stability Analysis in Electricity Markets</br><br>Author: Lin Xu, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Texas at  Austin, Austin, TX, United States, linxu@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ross Baldick</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A typical electricity market uses supply function competition.  We consider whether update dynamics lead to an SFE when participants begin with supply functions that are in the neighborhood of the SFE.  As observed by Baldick and Hogan, the space of supply functions is not a Banach space, so that standard local stability analysis results do not hold.  Following Hogan and Baldick, we truncate the infinite dimensional supply function space and apply stability analysis.</br>
