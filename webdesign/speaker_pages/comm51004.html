Title: Endogeneity and Price Sensitivity in Customized Pricing<br>Author: A. Serdar Simsek, PhD Candidate, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, Uris Hall, 4L, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, asimsek13@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Phillips, Garrett Van Ryzin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Endogeneity occurs in customized pricing when a seller uses unrecorded customer characteristics correlated with price-sensitivity in setting the price. Endogeneity can lead traditional regression approaches to under-estimate price elasticity. We use two sources of data from auto loan pricing: one from an on-line lender and one from an indirect lender to test for endogeneity. We present our results as well as recommendations for how to detect and control for endogeneity in the estimation process.
