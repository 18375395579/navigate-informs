Endogeneity can lead traditional regression approaches to under-estimate price elasticity. We use two sources of data from auto loan pricing: one from an on-line lender and one from an indirect lender to test for endogeneity. We present our results as well as recommendations for how to detect and control for endogeneity in the estimation process.</br>
