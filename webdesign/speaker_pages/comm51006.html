The company learns demand through successive observations (online) and incorporates it in pricing decisions. We formulate the consumer choice model as a stochastic dynamic game and study its structural properties. Learning is integrated via an aggregating algorithm. We study the effects of strategic nature of consumers on the pricing policy of the company, and report numerical experience.</br>
