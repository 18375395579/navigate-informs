Title: Dynamic Pricing with Online Learning and Strategic Consumers<br>Author: Mikhail Nediak, Assistant Professor, School of Business, Queen's University, 143 Union Street, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada, mnediak@business.queensu.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Yuri Levin, Tanya Levin, Jeffrey McGill<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the problem of dynamic pricing when consumers are strategic and have unknown preferences. The company learns demand through successive observations (online) and incorporates it in pricing decisions. We formulate the consumer choice model as a stochastic dynamic game and study its structural properties. Learning is integrated via an aggregating algorithm. We study the effects of strategic nature of consumers on the pricing policy of the company, and report numerical experience.
