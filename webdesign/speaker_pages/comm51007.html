<br>Title: The Coordination of Pricing and Scheduling Decisions</br><br>Author: Nicholas G. Hall, Professor, Ohio State University, Fisher College of Business, 2100 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210-1144, United States, hall_33@cob.osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhi-Long Chen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the coordination of pricing and scheduling  decisions to maximize revenue less scheduling cost. We develop  an optimal algorithm and an FPTAS for solving three related problems. Our computational results estimate the value of coordination. This work is apparently the first study of pricing and job level scheduling coordination.</br>
