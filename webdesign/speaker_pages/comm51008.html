Title: Competitive Price Matching Guarantees in an Uncertain Demand Environment<br>Author: Arcan Nalca, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, arcan.nalca@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Tamer Boyaci, Saibal Ray<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Price matching guarantees are offers to match any lower price of the competitor. Firms require the availability of the product at the competitor location in order to match the price. If the product is not available there, the price is not matched. A duopoly model is built to investigate the price and inventory decisions and also the verification of inventory before matching the price. We show that verification of inventory allows firm to price discriminate based on the availability.
