Title: Supply and Demand Synchronization in Assemble-to-Order Supply Chains<br>Author: Markus Ettl, IBM Research, PO Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, msettl@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Karthik Sourirajan, Pu Huang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel availability management process called Available-to-Sell (ATS) that incorporates demand shaping and profitable demand response to drive better supply chain efficiency through improved synchronization of supply and demand. We develop an analytical optimization model to assess how the proposed availability management system affects supply chain performance and apply the model in a server computer manufacturing environment.
