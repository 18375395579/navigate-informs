Title: Inclusive Innovation in Supply Chains: Contract Leadership and Product Life-cycle Perspective<br>Author: Oleksiy Mnyshenko, University of California- San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92093, United States of America, omnyshenko@ucsd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vish Krishnan, Hyoduk Shin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Examining inclusive innovation to increase market coverage including lower market segment, we study a supply chain with three tiers in which a firm in each tier can invest to increase a quality of product. For example, Tesla Motors as a tier-zero manufacturer has invested heavily on a tier two battery supplier skipping a tier one firm. Focusing on market coverage, we show that as a product matures along its life-cycle, it is better to hand over contract leadership to the higher tier suppliers.
