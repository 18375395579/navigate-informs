Title: Incentive Alignment and Coordination of Project Supply Chains<br>Author: Shi Chen, Stanford University, 84 Hulme Court, Apt 109, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, shichen@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hau L. Lee<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This study addresses the incentive and coordination problem in project supply chains. We find that common contracts with simple contract terms lead to misalignment of incentives; we show that a more sophisticated but implementable contract, the delivery-schedule-based contract, can coordinate the supply chains if one properly sets up contract terms. We also show that the manufacturer should focus more on the information accuracy of the volatility rather than the duration of the supply lead time.
