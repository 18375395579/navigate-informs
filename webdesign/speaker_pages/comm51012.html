Title: The Energy Substition Effect in Closed Loop Supply Chains of Automotive Types<br>Author: Harold Krikke, Associate Professor, Tilburg University, Economics, PO Box 90153, Tilburg, 5000LE, Netherlands, Krikke@uvt.nl<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This talk will discuss the growing importance of energy in closed loop supply chains (CLSCs) due to rising energy prices. CLSCs can be beneficial from to perspectives : (1) 'Waste'  can be used as fuel in industrial processes or power plants thereyby substituting fossil fuels. (2) Recycling and remanufacturing can replace new production thereby substituting part of the forward supply chain. Both have great potential from an energy perspective. We discuss applications in the automotive industry with respect to tyres and present a (simple) model that optimizes the energy balances in closed loop supply chains.
