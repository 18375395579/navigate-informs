Carey Chair in Information Systems, Arizona State University, W. P. Carey School of Business, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, rob7585@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ryan Sougstad</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a value-at-risk model for trade-offs between contract profits and losses in service-level agreements for IT and software services management. We model contract duration and cost driver correlations, and illustrate how managers can control risk by forgoing revenue-maximizing contracts in lieu of more conservative service-level commitments, yet achieve higher profitability. Our research offers a financial economics basis for IT services governance.</br>
