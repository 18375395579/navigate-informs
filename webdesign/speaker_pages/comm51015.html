Title: Quality and Information Asymmetry in Service Outsourcing<br>Author: Fuqiang Zhang, Assistant Professor, University of California, Irvine, CA, United States, fzhang@uci.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper studies how to design service outsourcing contracts with quality consideration and the presence of asymmetric information. The results suggest that outsourcing companies can use relatively simple and yet robust contracts to assure a high level capacity and quality service even when they do not have perfect information about the service provider.
