Title: Evaluation of Direct-to-pharmacy Strategy Using Simulation of Pharmaceutical Supply Chain<br>Author: Lisa Niziolek, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, tieman@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yuehwern Yih<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In pharmaceutical supply chains, most products flow through wholesalers.  Although wholesalers provide services to drug makers and pharmacies, drug makers may consider selling directly to pharmacies.  Using a simulation model, we evaluate the impact of bypassing wholesalers on performance measures, including service level and costs.  Sensitivity analysis will determine how performance measures vary given changes to parameters such as demand variation, production reliability, and product mix.
