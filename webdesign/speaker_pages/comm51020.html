Title: Estimation, Pricing and Strategic Consumer Behavior<br>Author: Dan Zhang, Assistant Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, dan.zhang@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Adam Mersereau<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Demand estimation is an integral part of revenue management applications and is not considered in the recent literature on strategic consumer behavior. We consider strategic consumer behavior in an integrated estimation-pricing model. Analysis of the model leads to new insights into the effects of strategic consumer behavior on pricing. For example, the long run equilibrium revenue from a two-price policy can be lower than that from a single-price policy.
