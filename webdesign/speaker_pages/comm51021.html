Title: Imperfect Demand Information in Production-Inventory Systems with Multiple Customer Classes<br>Author: Francis de Vericourt, Associate Professor, Duke University, 1 Towerview Road, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, fdv1@mail.duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Gayon, Saif Benjaarfar<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a make-to-stock supplier with limited capacity serving different customer classes, some of which share advance demand information with the supplier by announcing their orders ahead of their due date. The supplier is faced with a joint production control and inventory allocation problem. We formulate the problem as an MDP and characterize the optimal policy. From numerical results, we obtain several insights into the value of advance demand information for both supplier and customers.
