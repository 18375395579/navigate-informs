The delivery time from each supplier is uncertain. The whole-sale market opens for trading only in a short period, and so any product arriving earlier has  to wait and faces the risk of decay, while arriving later will lose  the sales opportunity. We formulate the problem as a multi-supplier selection problem with random yield, and derive the  optimal selection criteria.</br>
