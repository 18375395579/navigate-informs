Title: Optimal Purchasing Policies of Fresh Product with Random Delivery Times<br>Author: Xiaoqiang Cai, Professor, Chinese University of HK, Dept of SE&EM, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong - ROC, xqcai@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Xiaolin Xu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A distributor purchases a fresh product from multiple suppliers, to  sell it at a whole-sale market. The delivery time from each supplier is uncertain. The whole-sale market opens for trading only in a short period, and so any product arriving earlier has  to wait and faces the risk of decay, while arriving later will lose  the sales opportunity. We formulate the problem as a multi-supplier selection problem with random yield, and derive the  optimal selection criteria.
