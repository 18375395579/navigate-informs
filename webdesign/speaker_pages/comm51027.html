<br>Title: The Effect of Incentives on New Product Development Outcomes and Timing</br><br>Author: Jurgen Mihm, Assistant Professor, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, jurgen.mihm@insead.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: NPD research has largely ignored the importance of incentives to individuals. Through game theoretic models we show that incentives provided by most of current practices endanger project outcomes and impact project timing by favoring late design changes. Individual incentives may help. For many projects, compared to linear contracts or Bayesian mechanisms, component level target costing makes the most efficient use of available information. We thus create an initial map for incentives in NPD.</br>
