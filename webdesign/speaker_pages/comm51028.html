Title: Supply Management in Proportional Product Markets<br>Author: Paul Kleindorfer, Professor, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, kleindorfer@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Onur Boyabatli<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In several supply chains (fed-cattle, soybean, petrochemicals), where there are spot markets for inputs, one unit of input is processed to produce proportional amounts of multiple-outputs. Building on previous work on options-based approaches to supply chain coordination, this research investigates the implications of the proportional product model on the supply management, in particular optimal mix of long-term and short-term (spot) contracting decisions.
