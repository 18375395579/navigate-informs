Title: Risk Management, Performance Incentives and Business Insurance in Supply Chains<br>Author: Juan Serpa, PhD student, University of British Columbia, Sauder School of Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z2, Canada, juan.serpa@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Harish Krishnan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Performance-Based Contracts (PBCs) play a dual role: they incentivize manufacturers to invest in reliability, and also reduce the buyer's risk exposure. Why then do product buyers also use business insurance to mitigate the risk associated with product failure? We study a context where the contracting parties are subject to limited liability constraints. We show that when limited liability is binding, insurance and PBCs complement each other to optimally balance incentives and risk mitigation.
