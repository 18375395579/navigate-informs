<br>Title: A Call-Back Auction for Oversold Flights</br><br>Author: Sean Zhou, CUHK, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, zhoux@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhiheng Zhong</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Overbooking has been a widely used strategy by airlines to increase their revenue. However, customers are upset when they were bumped at the gate, which may also affect the future revenue of the airline. We propose and analyze a call-back auction mechanism, in which the passengers are asked to submit a bid when they purchase the tickets, which indicates the compensation they would like to receive for giving up their tickets. Comparison is made between this mechanism and the existing ones.</br>
