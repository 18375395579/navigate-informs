<br>Title: Price Effects in Online Product Reviews: An Analytical Model and Empirical Analysis</br><br>Author: Xinxin Li, Assistant Professor, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Road, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, xli@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lorin Hitt</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Consumer reviews may reflect not only perceived quality but also the difference between price and quality (perceived value). In markets where product prices change frequently, these price-influenced reviews may be biased as a signal of product quality when referred by consumers without possessing knowledge of historical prices. In this paper, we examine the price effects in consumer reviews for different formats of review systems using actual market prices and online consumer ratings data.</br>
