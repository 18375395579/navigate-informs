Title: Pricing Electricity in Pools with Stochastic Producers<br>Author: Juan Miguel Morales, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark, jmmgo@imm.dtu.dk<br>Coauthor(s): Antonio Conejo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: As the presence of stochastic producers in a power system increases, balancing costs may become highly dependent on the day-ahead market outcomes. We present a clearing algorithm for a day-ahead electricity market that co-optimizes the forward dispatch and the projected balancing actions by using a two-stage stochastic programming approach. A set of electricity prices that consistently supports the forward positions acquired by market agents under this form of market clearing is investigated.
