Swaminathan, Dimitris Kostamis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study how competition and demand uncertainty affect firms' timing of service level decisions relative to demand realization. We model a symmetric duopoly in which firms compete on price and service levels and analytically characterize the Nash equilibrium in the timing of service level decisions.</br>
