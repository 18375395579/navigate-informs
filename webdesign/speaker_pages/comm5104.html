<br>Title: The Effect of Online Consumer Reviews on Firm Pricing Strategies</br><br>Author: Necati Tereyagoglu, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Management, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, necati.tereyagoglu@scheller.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the change in pricing decisions of a seller after the availability of online consumer reviews in a market. The seller sells a good to a market with heterogeneous consumers in terms of their preferences and expertise over two periods. We show that the firm may charge a premium in advance and strategically decrease the price afterwards with the availability of the consumer reviews despite the lack of informed consumers in the market.</br>
