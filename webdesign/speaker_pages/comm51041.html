Title: On Nash Equilibria in Duopolistic Power Markets Subject to Make-whole Uplift<br>Author: Gui Wang, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 206 Transportation Building, Urbana, IL, United States of America, xjtu.wg@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Sean Meyn, Uday Shanbhag<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a capacitated duopolistic power market, characterized by marginal cost pricing and make-whole uplift, in which firms bid offer functions. The characterization of equilibria proves challenging, particularly due to discontinuous payoff functions. Little is known regarding the nature of equilibria. Our study shows the following: When demand can be satisfied entirely by one of the generating firms, pure-strategy Nash equilibria arise; otherwise, mixed-strategy Nash equilibria exist.
