The characterization of equilibria proves challenging, particularly due to discontinuous payoff functions. Little is known regarding the nature of equilibria. Our study shows the following: When demand can be satisfied entirely by one of the generating firms, pure-strategy Nash equilibria arise; otherwise, mixed-strategy Nash equilibria exist.</br>
