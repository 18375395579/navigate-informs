Title: The Impact of Demand Variability in a Centralized Healthcare Supply Chain<br>Author: Claudia Rosales, Assistant Professor, Michigan State University, 350 North Business Complex, East Lansing, Mi, 48824, United States of America, rosales@bus.msu.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Large healthcare systems usually consolidate the purchasing, storage, and delivery of all medical supplies in one centralized department achieving economies of scale. Nevertheless the efficiency of a centralized distribution system can be affected by factors such as seasonal consumption patterns. We study the impact of demand seasonality in a centralized healthcare supply chain and provide decision support systems to reduce its impact on customer service level, inventory, and operating costs.
