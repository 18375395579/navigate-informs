We study how the buyer’s payment changes in the error rate, supplier’s design knowledge, and competition intensity. Surprisingly, we find that a higher error rate can sometimes shrink the buyer’s total payment by mitigating supplier windfall profits. We also show pre-paying re-design profits can be an alternative strategy to stem windfall profits.</br>
