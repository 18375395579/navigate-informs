We analyze the system when the retailers are jointly replenished under policies within the Inventory Position Regenerative Ordering Policy class. We address a number of questions such as impact of warehouse function as a cross-dock, impact of policy choice on intra-chain dynamics, impact of policies on distribution of costs across echelons.</br>
