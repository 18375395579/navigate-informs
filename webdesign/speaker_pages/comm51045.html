When competing with regular retailers who provide a large variety, they may use temporal variety (change the displayed variant over time) and low price to attract customers. Our research investigates the cost and benefit of the temporal variety strategy and shows that under certain conditions, retailers using this strategy might be more profitable than the regular retailers using spatial variety strategies.</br>
