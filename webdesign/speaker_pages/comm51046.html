<br>Title: Spatially Differentiated Trade of Permits for Electric Power Supply Chains with Noncompliance</br><br>Author: Trisha Woolley, Ph.D Student, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, 121 Presidents Drive, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, twoolley@som.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Stranlund, Anna Nagurney</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we develop an electric power supply chain model with alternative technologies that incorporates a multipollutant tradable permit system with (possible) noncompliance. The equilibrium prices of the electric power transactions and those of the multiple permits, along with their quantities, and penalties assessed for noncompliance are determined using variational inequality theory. A computational procedure that exploits the structure of the problem is applied to numerical examples.</br>
