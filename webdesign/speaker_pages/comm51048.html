We show, both theoretically and experimentally the existence of two contrary effects: On one hand, these symbolic awards may have motivational effects on the recipient’s behavior. On the other hand, giving out an award to a supplier gives a signal to other buyers that this supplier is good, intensifying the competition to get the good supplier.
