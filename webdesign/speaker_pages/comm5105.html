Title: A Decentralized Distribution System with the Manufacturer’s Buyback and Resale<br>Author: Greys Sosic, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States, sosic@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ulas Ozen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We analyze a distribution system in which n retailers facing uncertain demand order inventory from a manufacturer. Orders arrive to the warehouse after a lead time, during which the retailers update demand forecasts. The manufacturer can buy back items from the retailers facing low demand and sell them to those facing high demand. We study the impact of this resale opportunity and compare our results with other cases (no resale of returned items, retailers redistributing inventory on their own).
