Applying the epsilon-Nash equilibrium framework to a sequence of markets with growing aggregate demand allows us to identify key properties of these markets. When restricting the demand models under consideration, we show that competition forces the firms to operate in the Quality and Efficiency Driven (QED) operational regime.</br>
