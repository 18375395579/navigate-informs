<br>Title: Optimal Allocation of Multiple Biomass Resources for Biofuel Production in the United States</br><br>Author: Nathan Parker, Graduate Student Researcher, University of California, Davis, Institute of Transportation Studies, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, ncparker@ucdavis.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yueyue Fan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we will present how multiple biomass resources,  including energy crops and biowastes, could be optimally allocated for biofuel production in the United States for two policy goals.  First, we will estimate the supply of biofuels as an economic substitute for petroleum fuel.  Second, we will estimate the potential for climate change mitigation through biofuels.  We consider the costs and climate impacts of the entire fuel supply chain from the feedstock to the end users.</br>
