Title: Dynamic Pricing for On Demand Bandwidth Services<br>Author: Robert Hampshire, PhD Candidate, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, rhampshi@Princeton.EDU<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Motivated by a bandwidth leasing service, we consider a loss system model with a finite amount of bandwidth. Viewing demand as a function of the service price and time, we construct a dynamic pricing policy that maximizes profit while satisfying the quality of service constraints of the customers. Optimal control theory and calculus of variations are employed to develop the congestion pricing policy. This is joint work with Prof. W.A. Massey of Princeton and Qiong Wang of Lucent Technologies.
