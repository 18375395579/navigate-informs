<br>Title: Pricing Dynamics of Competitors Whose Models Ignore Competition</br><br>Author: Anton Kleywegt, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Industrial Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, anton@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William L. Cooper, Tito Homem-de-Mello</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a duopoly in which sellers do not have the correct model specification. The demand model that each seller estimates with the seller's data, models the quantity demanded as a function of the price of the seller, and these models do not include the price of the other seller. We compare the resulting dynamical behavior with the outcomes in other settings, such as equilibria of well informed competitors, the outcomes of collaborators, and the outcomes when there is asymmetric information.</br>
