Title: Decentralized Inventory Sharing with Asymmetric Information<br>Author: Xinghao Yan, Purdue University, Krannert School of Management, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States, yan1@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hui Zhao<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study two retailers who privately hold demand information, non-cooperatively determine their order quantities, but cooperatively share inventory with each other. We characterize retailers' Bayesian Nash equilibrium order quantities. We find although sharing information does not always benefit retailers, coordination scheme can be developed if the retailers truthfully share information. When incorporating truth-inducing mechanism with the coordination scheme, an all-win situation is ensured.
