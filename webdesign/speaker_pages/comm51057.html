Title: Managing Supply Disruptions via Multiple Sourcing when Output Affects Market Price<br>Author: Bin Hu, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Kenan-Flagler Business School, McColl Building CB3490, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, Bin_Hu@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Kostamis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a manufacturer's sourcing strategies when some but not all suppliers face supply disruption risks, and the manufacturer's output affects market price. We find that 1) when the manufacturer orders from reliable and unreliable suppliers, unreliable orders are invariant of market size; 2) when ordering from one reliable and one unreliable supplier, the total order quantity and its allocation between the two are independent decisions. We then extend all results to an asymmetric oligopoly.
