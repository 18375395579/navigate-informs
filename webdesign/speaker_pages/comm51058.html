<br>Title: Sales Force Incentives for New and Remanufactured Products</br><br>Author: Jeremy Kovach, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree St. NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, Jeremy.Kovach@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sumitro Banerjee, Atalay Atasu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Firms are increasingly offering remanufactured products alongside new products in the same market.  We develop optimal sales force incentives for a single sales agent responsible for new and remanufactured products as well as for separate sales agents responsible for each of the products.  Furthermore, we investigate how these compensation schemes change depending on the organizational structure, perceived quality of remanufactured products, demand uncertainty, and sales agent risk aversion.</br>
