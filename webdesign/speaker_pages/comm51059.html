The objective is to find the subset of markets that maximizes profit. The profit of a subset of markets consists of the revenues minus the minimum lot-sizing cost to satisfy the demands of the selected markets. We discuss the NP-completeness of the problem, and we develop polynomial time algorithms for some special cases of the problem.</br>
