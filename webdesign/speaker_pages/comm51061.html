<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing Model for a Duopoly Market</br><br>Author: Xin Liu, Postdoc, University of Minnesota, Institute for Mathematics and its, Applications, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, liuxin@ima.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Cooper</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a duopoly with two sellers. Each of the sellers has one product. We focus on a linear demand model, namely, the demand of each product depends on prices of both products linearly. We obtain a sufficient condition, under which the prices converges to the Nash equilibrium prices. Such a sufficient condition can be formulated in terms of the covariance matrix of the prices. In particular, the correlation between two prices play an important role for the asymptotic optimality.</br>
