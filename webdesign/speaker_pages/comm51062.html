Title: Bargaining in Supply Chains<br>Author: Stephen Leider, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, leider@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Lovejoy<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study experimentally bargaining in a multiple-tier supply chain with sequential bargaining between tiers.  Our treatments vary the cost difference between firms in tiers 1 and 2, with larger cost differences reflecting increased bargaining power.  We measure how these underlying costs influence the efficiency and profit distribution with the supply chain, and the extent to which bargaining power and fairness concerns influence the negotiated prices.
