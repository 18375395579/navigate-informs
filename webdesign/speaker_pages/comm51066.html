Title: Improving Operational Competitiveness through Bankruptcy<br>Author: Song Alex Yang, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Sussex Place, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, sayang@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rodney Parker, John Birge<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study how a distressed firm can use bankruptcy reorganization to  improve operational competitiveness and how this strategy influences its competitor, supplier, and creditors. A successful reorganization allows the bankrupt firm to lower its operational cost and that this outcome improves the efficiency of the chain overall. However, in the long run, easy reorganization benefits the supplier and the non-distressed competitor but may hurts the distressed firm.
