Title: Bounded Rationality in a Two-tier Supply Chain<br>Author: Basak Kalkanci, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, United States of America, kalkanci@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine models that incorporate a spectrum of behavior (fully rational versus boundedly rational) in a supplier-retailer dyad. We show that the supplier’s and retailer’s profit are not monotone in the retailer’s rationality: the supplier may prefer that either the retailer makes very noisy decisions or that she is an optimizer. We quantify how much is lost by assuming perfect rationality and the value of using minimax regret criterion when the retailer’s rationality is not known.
