<br>Title: Subcontracting Strategies with Stochastic Third-party Capacity and Tardiness Sharing Contracts</br><br>Author: Tolga Aydinliyim, Assistant Professor, Decision Sciences Department, Lundquist College of Business, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, 97403, United States of America, tolga@uoregon.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Vairaktarakis</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A manufacturer cannot process all his workload before the customer due date and subcontracts part of his workload to a third-party with stochastic prior commitments. We study two different contracts; (i) a price-only contract, and (ii) a tardiness penalty sharing contract. The second contract coordinates the chain, Pareto-dominates all non-coordinating contracts if the contract parameters are negotiated jointly, and achieves higher chain efficiency even when there is coordination failure.</br>
