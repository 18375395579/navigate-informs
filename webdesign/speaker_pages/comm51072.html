Title: Memory-dependent Pricing and Product Introduction Timing for Multiple Product Generations<br>Author: Hasan Arslan, Professor of Information Systems & Operations Management, Sawyer Business School, Stahl Center, 73 Tremont St., 7th floor, Boston, MA, United States, harslan@suffolk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cyril Shmatov, Soulaymane Kachani<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider introduction timing and pricing for successive product generations, when demand is impacted by the reference price formed by consumers. We characterize the optimal product introduction time and pricing strategies explicitly for two successive generations, and propose a general quasi-analytic solution. We extend the analysis to a competitive environment.
