We study the structure of trade-in programs to understand their effectiveness and efficiency. In comparing decentralized supply chain performance, we show the fraction of returns going to the secondary retail market to be the key for the trade-in firm's incentives to coordinate the used-product collection and the secondary retail.</br>
