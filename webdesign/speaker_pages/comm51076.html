Title: Selling to Strategic Consumers: on the Benefits of  Valuation Uncertainty and Targeting Capabilities<br>Author: Dror Hermel, 1004 West Cordova Street, Vancouver, BC, V6E 3T3, Canada, Dror.Hermel@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Benny Mantin, Yossi Aviv<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a 2 period model. In the first setting a revenue maximizing seller encounters consumers who are faced with valuation uncertainty. We show that the seller may benefit from encountering strategic rather than myopic consumers. Also, offering a return option can be beneficial. In the second setting the consumers' valuation is certain. The seller can target certain consumers with a discount coupon. In this case we show the adverse effects of strategic consumers can be eliminated.
