In the first setting a revenue maximizing seller encounters consumers who are faced with valuation uncertainty. We show that the seller may benefit from encountering strategic rather than myopic consumers. Also, offering a return option can be beneficial. In the second setting the consumers' valuation is certain. The seller can target certain consumers with a discount coupon. In this case we show the adverse effects of strategic consumers can be eliminated.</br>
