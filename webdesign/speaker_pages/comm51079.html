Title: Service Dynamics Under Repeated Interactions<br>Author: Sam Aflaki, INSEAD, Blvd de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77300, France, sam.aflaki@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ioana Popescu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We model the dynamics of a service relationship where the provider can adjust the service level offered to customers in each period. Customers periodically decide to renew the service contract based on previous experiences and future expectations. We characterize the firm’s optimal service strategies under various models of consumer behavior. In particular, we identify what behavioral patterns and properties of the firm’s cost structure lead to oscillating vs. monotone service paths.
