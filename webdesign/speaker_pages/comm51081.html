The firm is a price-taker and faces multiple sources of uncertainty, e.g., market price, materials costs, and capacity yield. The firm will enter bankruptcy if its revenue is sufficiently low; to mitigate this, it may presell some capacity at a fixed price. We find the optimal preselling strategy and explore conditions that influence the value of preselling such as customer anticipation of failure.</br>
