Alex Yang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We analyze the costs and benefits of preselling capacity by a firm that is prone to bankruptcy. The firm is a price-taker and faces multiple sources of uncertainty, e.g., market price, materials costs, and capacity yield. The firm will enter bankruptcy if its revenue is sufficiently low; to mitigate this, it may presell some capacity at a fixed price. We find the optimal preselling strategy and explore conditions that influence the value of preselling such as customer anticipation of failure.
