Title: To Market, To Market, To Sell A Fat Pig<br>Author: Jeffrey Ohlmann, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, Tippie College of Business, 3749 Donegal Ct., Iowa City, IA, 52246, United States, jeffrey-ohlmann@uiowa.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Philip Jones<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Pork producers must determine when to sell pigs, which and how many pigs to sell, and to which packer(s) to sell them. We model the decision-making problem as a linear mixed-integer program and implement a spreadsheet-based decision support system that determines the marketing strategy that maximizes expected annual profit. Utilizing data  provided by Cargill Animal Nutrition, we validate the model and demonstrate significant strategic departures from industry rules-of-thumb.
