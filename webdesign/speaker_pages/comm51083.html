<br>Title: Timing and Signaling Considerations for Recovery from Supply Chain Disruption</br><br>Author: Zhibin (Ben) Yang, Assistant Professor, University of Oregon, 1208 University of Oregon, Eugene, 97403, United States of America, zyang@uoregon.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nagesh Murthy</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a supplier's timing decisions for recovery from a disruption, when the buyer trades off backup option and waiting for supply recovery.  The supplier quotes a due date for recovery, and can accelerate supply recovery by increasing effort. We find the supplier strategically quotes an early due date for retaining the buyer, leading to Pareto-improvement of the channel. When the supplier is privately informed about disruption severity, the due date serves as a signal of disruption severity.</br>
