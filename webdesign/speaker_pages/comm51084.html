W. Mong Engineering Building, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - ROC, yyfeng@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhan Pang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a house developer who designs an options contract in a presales (sales-before-completion)  housing market. The spot price in the housing market is random and is assumed to be a diffusion process.  The demand approaches housing systems as a  Poisson stream and the arrival rate is sensitive to the premium and affected by spot price.  The premium of each house is dynamically adusted. Finally, we discuss the optimal contract design issue and the optimal capacity investment decison.</br>
