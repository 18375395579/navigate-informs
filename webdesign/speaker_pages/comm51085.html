Title: The Curse of Reliability: Outsourcing Restoration Services for Infrequent Equipment Failures<br>Author: Sang-Hyun Kim, Assistant Professor, Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States of America, sang.kim@yale.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Morris Cohen, Serguei Netessine, Senthil Veeraraghavan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Manufacturing firms cannot afford significant operational downtime of mission-critical equipment. Although resolving problems quickly is essential to minimizing the impact of disruptions, incentivizing the suppliers to provide prompt restoration services is challenging because of infrequent nature of failures. We investigate contracting efficiency in this environment, and find that firms may face a paradoxical situation in which high equipment reliability corresponds to high contracting cost.
