Title: Managing Risks of Information Asymmetry and Demand Uncertainty in Assembly Supply Chains<br>Author: Xiang Fang, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 3202 N Maryland Avenue, Milwaukee, WI, 53211, United States of America, fangx@uwm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Ru, Yunzeng Wang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a decentralized assembly supply chain in which an assembler (she) assembles a set of components, each produced by a different supplier (he), into a final product to satisfy an uncertain market demand. Each supplier holds private cost information to himself, for which the assembler only has a subjetive estimate. The assembler aims to find an optimal menu of contracts in order to maximize her own expected profit and induce each supplier to truthfully reveal his private cost information.
