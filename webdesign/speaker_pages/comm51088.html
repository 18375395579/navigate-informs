The emergence of new online retailing channels may act as a substitute for the benefits of urban concentration both by offering lower prices and by providing increased product variety. We explore these questions using data from Amazon on the top twenty books, and DVDs for over 8626 unique locations over 10 months. We discuss implications for the Long Tail.
