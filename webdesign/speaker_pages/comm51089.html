It is an indication that the product is likely of high quality as many other consumers have bought the product. This may motivate the consumer to search for the product in other stores. We discuss how the equilibrium consumer search and purchasing behavior depends on the costs of information gathering for the consumer and the store replenishment rates.</br>
