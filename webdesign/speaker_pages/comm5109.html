<br>Title: Optimizing Tooling Investments Across Internal and External Organizational Boundaries</br><br>Author: Blake Johnson, Consulting Professor, Stanford University, 12881 Via Grimaldi, Del Mar, CA, 92014, United States, blakej@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Most automotive components have custom specifications that necessitate investments in custom tooling.

Differences in information and incentives between these three parties create biases that impact performance, but which may be addressed with appropriately structured contingent performance commitments.</br>
