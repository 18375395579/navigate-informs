The suppliers differ in yield distributions, costs and capacity levels. The model determines which potential suppliers are to be retained and what size order is to be placed with each. We consider both the problem of minimizing procurement costs subject to a service level constraint and that of minimizing procurement plus inventory and backlogging costs.</br>
