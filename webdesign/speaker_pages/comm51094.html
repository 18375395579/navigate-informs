<br>Title: Salesforce Compensation when Agents Serve a Common Customer Queue</br><br>Author: Elnaz Jalilipour Alishah, University of Washington, Box 353200, Foster School of Business, UW, Seattle, WA, 98195-3200, United States of America, jalilipo@uw.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hamed Mamani, Yong-Pin Zhou</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study salesforce compensation issues when two independent agents get customers from a common customer queue. When agents spend more time with each customer, they get higher customer satisfaction and more conversion to sales (hence compensation). At the same time, slowing down means fewer customers and longer waits for them causing disutility. We show system inefficiency in this competition model and study incentives and allocation mechanisms to induce system-optimal behavior from the agents.</br>
