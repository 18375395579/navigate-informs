Title: Product Contamination and Traceability in the Food Supply Chain<br>Author: Gary Gaukler, Texas A&M University, TAMU 3131, College Station, TX, United States of America, gaukler@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vijaya Chebolu-Subramanian<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this talk, we study the disruption to part or whole of a food supply chain due to product contamination of any type. We consider a real world situation where a contaminated food product (meat, produce, etc.) has entered the supply chain. We frame this problem as a multi-stage supply chain network and evaluate the impact of real-time product traceability on several performance metrics.
