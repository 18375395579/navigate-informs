<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Management for Systems with Dual Unreliable Suppliers</br><br>Author: Xiting Gong, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Room 1815, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, xitingg@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiuli Chao, Shaohui Zheng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the joint pricing and inventory replenishment problem for a system with random demand and two unreliable suppliers of different lead times. Suppliers may or may not be able to deliver an order in a period, and the delivery capability of each supplier evolves in a Markovian nature over time.   We characterize the optimal policies in each period, and study the impacts of source diversification and supplier reliability on the firm and its customers.</br>
