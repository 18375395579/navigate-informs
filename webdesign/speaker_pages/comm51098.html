<br>Title: Dynamic Price Forecasting in Simultaneous Online Art Auctions</br><br>Author: Mayukh Dass, Assistant Professor of Marketing, Texas Tech University, Rawls College of Business, MS2101, Lubbock, TX, 79409, United States of America, dass@terry.uga.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wolfgang Jank, Galit Shmueli</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel dynamic forecasting approach for predicting price in ongoing simultaneous online art auctions for Indian contemporary art. Our model forecasts the price from the time of prediction until auction close and updates its prediction in real-time as the auction progresses based on newly arriving information and price dynamics. We also investigate the source of the predictive power of price dynamics and find it to capture bidder competition within and across auctions.</br>
