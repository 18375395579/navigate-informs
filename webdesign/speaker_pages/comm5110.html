<br>Title: ICE: A Scalable and Expressive Iterative Combinatorial Exchange</br><br>Author: David Parkes, Associate Professor, Harvard University, 33 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States, parkes@eecs.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Lubin, Adam I. Juda, Jeffrey Shneidman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Combinatorial exchanges facilitate trade between multiple buyers and sellers that need to express complex preferences on bundles of items. Applications are to spectrum reallocation, airport slots, supply chain and logistics. ICE incorporates the following features: (a) a tree-based bidding language, (b) elicitation via refinement of   >bounds, (c) linear price feedback, (d) threshold-based payments.</br>
