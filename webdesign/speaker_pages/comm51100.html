Title: Optimal Partial Liquidation of a Multiple-asset Portfolio with Price Impact<br>Author: Miguel Lobo, INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Avenue, Singapore, 138676, Singapore, Miguel.LOBO@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Brown<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the partial liquidation of a portfolio of assets with temporary and permanent price impact of trading. This involves multiple objectives: the cash from transactions; the valuation of the final portfolio; and the average liquidity of the final portfolio. We obtain a closed-form solution for a basic version of the problem. A dynamic programming formulation accounts for the option value of maintaining a liquid portfolio and for uncertainty about the price impact of trading.
