This involves multiple objectives: the cash from transactions; the valuation of the final portfolio; and the average liquidity of the final portfolio. We obtain a closed-form solution for a basic version of the problem. A dynamic programming formulation accounts for the option value of maintaining a liquid portfolio and for uncertainty about the price impact of trading.</br>
