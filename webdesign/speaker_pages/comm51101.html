Title: Revenue Management with Strategic Customers<br>Author: John Wilson, Professor, Richard Ivey School of Business, University of Western Ontario, 1151 Richmond Street North, London, ON, N6A 3K7, Canada, jwilson@ivey.uwo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Anderson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a two period revenue management problem where customers may act strategically. Specifically, we allow for the possibility that a customer may decide to defer purchase in the hope that a ticket cheaper than those currently on offer will become available. We also allow for the possibility that some customers will buy a more expensive ticket if the cheaper tickets are not available.
