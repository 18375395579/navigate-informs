<br>Title: Strategic Management of Distressed Inventories</br><br>Author: Ozge Sahin, Assistant Professor of OMS, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, ozge@bus.umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guillermo Gallego, Robert Phillips</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We investigate models in which the decision to sell inventory at a discount will change the future expectations of customers and hence their buying behavior. We show that a single-price policy is optimal if all buyers are strategic and demand is known to the seller. Relaxing any of these conditions can lead to a situation in which a markdown policy is optimal. If customers update their expectations of availability over time, then optimal sales limit policies can evolve in a complex fashion.</br>
