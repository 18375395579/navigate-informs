Title: A Dynamic Pricing Model Under Duopoly Competition<br>Author: Benny Mantin, UBC, 2053 Main Mall, Sauder School of Business, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z2, Canada, benny.mantin@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Granot, Frieda Granot<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In a multi-period finite-horizon fixed-inventory setting, consumers zigzag between two competing retailers, selling identical goods, upon observing prices which exceed their willingness to pay (aka zigzag competition). We are interested in the effect of competition on pricing policies and corresponding retailers?profits. We find that prices decline exponentially, and we further investigate the robustness of the results by, e.g., changing consumers?characteristics.
