<br>Title: Judgment and Decision Biases in Inventory Replenishment Decisions: Framing and Anchoring Effects</br><br>Author: Travis Tokar, Visiting Assistant Professor, Ohio State University, 311 Fisher Hall, 2100 Neil Ave., Columbus, OH, 43147, United States, tokar_6@cob.osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Waller, John Aloysius</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Judgment and decision biases have been shown to adversely impact inventory replenishment efficiency. In a serial supply chain, order variance amplification, or the bullwhip effect, is a mechanism by which sub-optimal decision making in a dynamic setting results in cost inefficiencies. This research directly investigates the impact of two judgment biases: (1) loss aversion and (2) anchoring and insufficient adjustment, on replenishment decision making and resulting performance.</br>
