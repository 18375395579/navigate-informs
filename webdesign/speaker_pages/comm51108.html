Our model portrays the retailers as Stackelberg leaders. We find that intermediaries should avoid specialty and commodity products, efficiency can be achieved with the right balance of competition at different tiers, and retailers benefit from using intermediaries when it is costly for them to identify or validate suppliers.</br>
