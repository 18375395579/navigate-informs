St. Louis Ave, Chicago, IL, 60625, United States, jli@neiu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Facing leadtime uncertainty, the retailer conventionally places an order at a chosen time ahead to meet future demand.  In this paper we study the potential use of a flexible backup supplier in a sole role, as an emergency resource in response to the leadtime information, or in a dual role, as a regular supplier that is assigned to meet part of the original demand interval and as an emergency response to leadtime information.
