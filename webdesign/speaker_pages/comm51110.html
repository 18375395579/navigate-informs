We show that a cost-dependent order-up-to/pre-order-up-to/list-price policy is optimal. We offer the unique insight on the risk-seeking attitude of a risk-neutral firm and show that dual-sourcing and dynamic-pricing are strategically complementary in the presence of procurement cost fluctuating.</br>
