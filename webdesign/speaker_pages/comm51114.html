Title: Competitive Aspects in Assortment Planning<br>Author: Victor Martinez de Albeniz, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, Av. Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, valbeniz@iese.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sebastian Heese<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We present a model where different assortment planning strategies are compared. We find that it is usually best to pre-announce the assortment size but not declare which suppliers are included. Furthermore, we show that the best assortment size is typically smaller than the one that a centralized system would choose. Hence, artificially limiting the assortment size seems an effective strategy to drive supplier competition.
