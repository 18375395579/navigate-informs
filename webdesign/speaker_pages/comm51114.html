Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, valbeniz@iese.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sebastian Heese</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a model where different assortment planning strategies are compared. We find that it is usually best to pre-announce the assortment size but not declare which suppliers are included. Furthermore, we show that the best assortment size is typically smaller than the one that a centralized system would choose. Hence, artificially limiting the assortment size seems an effective strategy to drive supplier competition.</br>
