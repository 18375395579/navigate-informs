Title: Managing Quality Risk and Shortage Risk in Outsourcing<br>Author: Joline Uichanco, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, uichanco@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi, Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study availability and quality risk tradeoffs involved in outsourcing. The problem is to decide on a supplier base and quantity purchased from each supplier, as well as a level of quality assurance (QA). The goal is to balance purchasing, shortage, defect and QA costs. We develop a tractable algorithm for the supplier selection problem which converges to the optimal solution. For the selected suppliers, the firm will only establish a QA program if the batch size exceeds a threshold.
