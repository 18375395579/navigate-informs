Title: Retailer Location and Customer Demand Allocation Decisions Under Random Supply Disruptions<br>Author: Lian Qi, Assistant Professor, University of Missouri - Rolla, 107-I Fulton Hall, 1870 Miner Circle, Rolla, MO, 65409, United States, lianqi@umr.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study an integrated supply chain design problem that considers random disruptions at both the supplier and retailer echelons.  By analytically studying the integrated model, we discuss the impacts of random supply disruptions at the supplier and retailers on retailer location and customer demand allocation decisions, and provide sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for these decisions under random supply disruptions.  Both single and multiple sourcing strategies are considered.
