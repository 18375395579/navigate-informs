<br>Title: Profitability, Inventory Volatility, and Capital Structure</br><br>Author: John Birge, Chicago GSB, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL, United States of America, jbirge@chicagogsb.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Traditional theories of capital structure imply a consistent relationship between firm profitability and firm leverage.  Empirical data, however, suggest that the relationship is not monotonic. In the cross-section of firms, we describe how non-profitable firms become significantly more leveraged as losses decrease; profitable firms become significantly less leveraged as profits increase until a point where the most profitable firms have again significantly greater leverage as profits increase.</br>
