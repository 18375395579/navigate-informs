Professor, Cox School of Business, Southern Methodist University, PO Box 750333, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States, cchamber@mail.cox.smu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis, Ping Su</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This work considers the adoption of technology that will reduce unit production costs by one or two players sharing a single market.  We develop 3 models involving; a monopolist, a Stackelberg game involving two firms with a designated order of adoption, and an open loop game with no pre-specified order.  In each setting, market-size evolves according to Geometric Brownian Motion.</br>
