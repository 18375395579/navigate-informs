Title: Adoption of Cost Reducing Technology by Asymmetric Duopolists<br>Author: Chester Chambers, Asst. Professor, Cox School of Business, Southern Methodist University, PO Box 750333, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States, cchamber@mail.cox.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis, Ping Su<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This work considers the adoption of technology that will reduce unit production costs by one or two players sharing a single market.  We develop 3 models involving; a monopolist, a Stackelberg game involving two firms with a designated order of adoption, and an open loop game with no pre-specified order.  In each setting, market-size evolves according to Geometric Brownian Motion.
