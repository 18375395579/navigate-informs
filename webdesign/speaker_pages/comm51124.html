Title: Towards a Unified Theory of Procurement Contract Design: Production Flexibility, Spot Market Trading and the Structure of Sales and Options Contracts<br>Author: Pamela Pen-Erh Pei, PhD Candidate, MIT, 30A Mount Auburn Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States, ppei@mit.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine pricing of capacity options with post-contract production and information asymmetry under spot trading. We derive the optimal price scheme for capacity contracts and show that it is governed by three main pricing regimes. We identify the regions under which each regime is preferred by a supplier. We also explore the effects of spot market characteristics on contract design.
