Title: Complexity Reduction and Price Optimization at a Major Manufacturer of Construction Equipment<br>Author: Tallys Yunes, University of Miami, Department of Management Science, Coral Gables, FL, United States, tallys@miami.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Scheller-Wolf, Masha Shunko, Natalya Trapp, Valerie Tardif, Sridhar Tayur<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Companies with broad product lines face a common trade-off: product variety, which entices customers, is positively correlated with elevated costs. We develop an approach to capture customer behavior and complexity costs within an optimization model, and use it to select and price a profitable subset of machines spanning multiple overlapping product lines of a major machinery manufacturer. We present computational results with real data under a number of managerial and strategic scenarios.
