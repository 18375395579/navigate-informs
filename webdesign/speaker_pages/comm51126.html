<br>Title: Market Segmentation of Call Centers: The Case for Back-sourcing</br><br>Author: Yu Xia, Associate Professor, Northeastern University, 214 Hayden Hall, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA, 02115, United States of America, y.xia@neu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bintong Chen, Vaidy Jayaraman, Charles Munson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We construct a theoretical model to study call centers with different wage rates and productivity levels that compete for contracts of multiple clients. We develop conditions for a call center to dominate the market and conditions for several call centers to coexist in the market. These results are then used to explain the back-sourcing phenomenon in the market.  We survey an international service provider and find a strong match between our theoretical results and the empirical evidence.</br>
