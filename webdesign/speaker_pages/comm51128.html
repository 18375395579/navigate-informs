Title: Duopoly Competition Between Price-setting Newsvendors<br>Author: Harish Krishnan, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Harish.Krishnan@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Ralph Winter<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In a duopoly with demand uncertainty, consumers who experience a stock-out at one store may “spill over?to the competitor.  Demand spillovers can turn price competition on its head, making duopoly prices higher than the monopoly price.  The impact of higher prices will be offset by higher inventory levels.
