Title: Competing for Reservation Payments<br>Author: Eddie Anderson, University of Sydney, University of Sydney Business School, Sydney, Australia, edward.anderson@sydney.edu.au<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider generators competing to supply an uncertain demand, where reservation payments are made to ensure sufficient supply. In our model there are both reservation and execution prices. The buyer decides which blocks of capacity to reserve and pays the reservation price. After demand occurs the reserved capacity is dispatched in order of the execution price. We explore the structure of this model, and describe the optimal buyer policy and the equilibrium between generators.
