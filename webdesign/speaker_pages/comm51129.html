In our model there are both reservation and execution prices. The buyer decides which blocks of capacity to reserve and pays the reservation price. After demand occurs the reserved capacity is dispatched in order of the execution price. We explore the structure of this model, and describe the optimal buyer policy and the equilibrium between generators.</br>
