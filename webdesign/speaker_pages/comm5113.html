Title: Consumer Waiting for End-of-period Discounts: Evidence From a Behavioral Game<br>Author: Anton Ovchinnikov, Darden School of Business, University of Virginia, 100 Darden Blvd, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States of America, ovchinnikova@darden.virginia.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper presents a behavioral experiment. The seller varies the price to maximize the revenue, and the buyers decide to wait for a possible discount or buy early and guarantee the product. We discuss the case where human subjects play as buyers. How do they decide to wait-or-buy? How do subjects learn about the policy of the seller and other buyers? How do they react to the information the seller reveals?What information should the seller reveal? We discuss these and other related questions.
