Chou, National University of Singapore, 1 Business Link, BIZ 1, Singapore, mabelchou@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hua Tao</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Many companies now offer hundreds, if not thousands, of SKUs in order to compete in the market place. High correlations may exist among the utilities of these products due to common attributes among them, and these correlations may affect the customer's choice and the resulting sale of each product. Based on a model which addresses an inherent limitation of the popular Multinomial Logit model, we consider such correlations in making the product line selection and inventory control decisions.</br>
