The core of this law is that each company which sells electronic products has the obligation to recollect and recycle an amount which is proportional to the market share of the company. To avoid a monopoly in some region, all basic areas which are allocated to the same corporation should be geographically as dispersed as possible. We present a mathematical model, properties and computational results.</br>
