Under a typical revenue sharing contract, if it is impossible or prohibitively expensive for the manufacturer to verify the retailer’s sales reports, the retailer has incentive to under-report sales and cheat the manufacturer out of part of its profit. We develop a simple analytical model to investigate the impact of cheating on the different supply chain constituents.</br>
