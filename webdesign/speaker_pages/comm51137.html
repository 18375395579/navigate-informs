Title: Pricing Access Services and Warranties<br>Author: Ozge Sahin, University of Michigan, ozge@bus.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guillermo Gallego<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider how consumer's uncertainty in the valuations and the amount they will consume impact the demand over time and how the firm can exploit consumer's uncertainty in pricing decisions. We investigate the optimal structure of the contracts that a firm should offer in industries that charge access fees to consumers. We provide guidelines on pricing access services and warranties if the consumers are facing time inconsistency and have different risk preferences.
