Title: Managed Print Service Pricing using a Linear Model for Customer Service Valuation<br>Author: Jie Ning, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Industrial & Operations Engineering, Ann Arbor, United States of America, jien@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Volodymyr Babich, John Handley, Jussi Keppo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We find optimal contracts for a managed print service provider with new institutional customers. Contracts considered comprise five parts: fixed price, variable prices for BW and color prints, and free-usage allowances for BW and color prints. Our pricing framework consists of two parts: a parsimonious valuation model that generates reliable estimates for the new customer's willingness to pay (WTP), and an optimization model that yields the optimal contracts.
