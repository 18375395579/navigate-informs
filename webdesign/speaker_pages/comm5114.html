<br>Title: Disruptions and Market Competition on The Supply Chain Network</br><br>Author: Renato de Matta, Associate Professor, University of Iowa, 108 PBB, Iowa City, IA, 52241, United States of America, renato-dematta@uiowa.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a model  to study the effects of disruptions and market competition on the formation of a supply chain and transfer prices. We exploit the natural separation between the material flow and cash allocation decisions utilizing a generalized decomposition scheme to find good feasible solutions to our model. Computational results and managerial insights are presented.</br>
