Title: Dynamic Supply Risk Management under Information Asymmetry<br>Author: Long Gao, Assistant Professor, UC Riverside, 221 AGSM, UCR, Riverside, United States of America, long.gao@ucr.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nan Yang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a dynamic supply risk management problem in a decentralized supply chain. The problem features private supply risk information and incentives for information misreporting and underinvestment in quality. Our study shows how to motivate the supplier to truthfully share the supply state and invest in quality improvement, as well as when to terminate the relationship.
