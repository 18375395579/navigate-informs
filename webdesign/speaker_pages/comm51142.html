Title: Impact of Downstream Competition on Innovation in a Supply Chain<br>Author: Jingqi Wang, jingqi-wang@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyo duk Shin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We explore the impact of downstream competition on upstream innovation in a supply chain. We show that this impact depends on the contract form used in the industry. We also demonstrate that all firms within a supply chain can be better off by giving the supplier more channel power. Our findings have implications related to First Solar’s recent challenge on how to encourage component manufacturer(s) to invest more on innovation.
