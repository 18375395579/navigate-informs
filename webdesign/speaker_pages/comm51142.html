We show that this impact depends on the contract form used in the industry. We also demonstrate that all firms within a supply chain can be better off by giving the supplier more channel power. Our findings have implications related to First Solar’s recent challenge on how to encourage component manufacturer(s) to invest more on innovation.</br>
