<br>Title: Monetizing Viral Impressions: Advertiser Dependent Price Differentiation</br><br>Author: Anwesha Bhattacharjee, University of Texas at Dallas, 2200 WATERVIEW PKWY APT 1836, RICHARDSON, TX, 75080, United States of America, axb094820@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vijay Mookerjee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Facebook does not price viral impressions of advertiser content losing out on revenue as sharing of ad content increases. This paper analyzes a price differentiation strategy for Facebook to discriminate between advertisers differing in viral content. Under the proposed model setup, Facebook maximizes revenue for ad content with low likelihood for sharing by charging a low premium followed by additional cost per viral view and a high premium with free shares for content likely to go viral.</br>
