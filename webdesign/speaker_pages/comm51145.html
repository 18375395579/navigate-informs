<br>Title: Bullwhip Mitigation with Advance Forecast Sharing and Order Updates</br><br>Author: Hau Lee, Professor, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, lee_hau@gsb.stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Li Chen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: How does advance demand information reduces the supply chain bullwhip effect?  How about if the retailer simply places advance orders but updates it over time?  Using a very general demand model, we can show that both can reduce the bullwhip, but the advance order update approach eliminates the need for the supplier to guess the retailer's underlying ordering policy.</br>
