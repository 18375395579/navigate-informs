This paper analyzes the optimal advertising strategy for firms on Facebook. The findings suggest that a firm with a bigger initial market will spend less on the campaign. Results also indicate there are distinct regions where Facebook’s revenue decreases as sharing increases and Facebook has an opportunity cost for providing viral impressions to an advertiser for free.
