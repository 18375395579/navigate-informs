Title: Pricing and Static Hedging of American Options under the Jump to Default Extended CEV Model<br>Author: Jose Carlos Dias, ISCTE-IUL Business School, Complexo INDEG/ISCTE, Av. Prof. Anibal Bettencourt, Lisboa, Portugal, jose.carlos.dias@iscte.pt<br>Coauthor(s): Joao Pedro Ruas, Joao Pedro Nunes<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper prices American options through the static hedge approach (SHP) and extends the literature in two directions. First, American options are priced under the CEV model of Cox (1975) through the SHP procedure offered by Chung and Shih (2009), but now extended for any elasticity parameter (beta) of the CEV process. Second, the SHP approach is adapted to the JDCEV model of Carr and Linetsky (2006), and American options on defaultable equity are also priced.
