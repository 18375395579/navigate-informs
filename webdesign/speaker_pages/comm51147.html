First, American options are priced under the CEV model of Cox (1975) through the SHP procedure offered by Chung and Shih (2009), but now extended for any elasticity parameter (beta) of the CEV process. Second, the SHP approach is adapted to the JDCEV model of Carr and Linetsky (2006), and American options on defaultable equity are also priced.</br>
