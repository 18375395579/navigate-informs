Title: Dynamic Pricing with Options<br>Author: Guillermo Gallego, Professor, Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States, gmg2@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozge Sahin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a finite capacity, finite horizon perishable inventory model in discrete time where costumer classes with different willingness to pay distributions arrive sequentially and update their valuations until the end of the horizon. We use Dynamic Programming to compute incentive compatible call options for each customer class to maximize expected revenues and compare revenues with options to revenues under a low-to-high pricing strategy.
