<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Management under Price-and-Inventory Sensitive Demand</br><br>Author: Renyu (Philip) Zhang, Ph. D. student, Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, Campus Box 1133, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States of America, renyu.zhang@wustl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nan Yang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a periodic review pricing and inventory management problem where demand is negatively correlated with both leftover inventory and price. We show that an order-up-to, dispose-down-to, list price policy is optimal. The inventory sensitivity effect contributes to decreased price and inventory levels. Such decrease will be intensified by higher demand sensitivity and dampened if the firm applies the inventory withholding policy.</br>
