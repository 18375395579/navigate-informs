Title: The Simple Economics of Approximately Optimal Auctions<br>Author: Nima Haghpanah, PhD Student, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, nima.haghpanah@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Saeed Alaei, Hu Fu, Jason D. Hartline<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider mechanism design in environments where the agents have multi-dimensional  and non-linear preferences. In these environments maximizing marginal revenue may not be optimal, and furthermore, there is sometimes no direct way to implementing the marginal revenue maximization mechanism. We characterize the settings for which marginal revenue maximization is optimal and we show that marginal revenue maximization is approximately optimal.
