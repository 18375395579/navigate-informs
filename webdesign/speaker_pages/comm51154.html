We focus on the interaction between a single firm that decides on its technology choice (flexible vs dedicated), capacity level, production quantities and a single creditor that provides funds to the firm to finance its operational investments. We demonstrate that some of the common operational insights do not continue to hold in imperfect markets.</br>
