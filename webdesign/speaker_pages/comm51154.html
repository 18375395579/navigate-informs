Title: Capacity Investment in Imperfect Capital Markets<br>Author: Onur Boyabatli, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore, onur.boyabatli@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Beril Toktay<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the effect of capital market imperfections on firm’s operational decisions in a capacity investment setting. We focus on the interaction between a single firm that decides on its technology choice (flexible vs dedicated), capacity level, production quantities and a single creditor that provides funds to the firm to finance its operational investments. We demonstrate that some of the common operational insights do not continue to hold in imperfect markets.
