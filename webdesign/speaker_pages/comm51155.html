This paper extends this work by exploring the nature of such equilibria when there are forward swap contracts, which are common in electricity markets. There are surprisingly far reaching effects: e.g there is no longer a natural ordering between different equilibria. We show uniqueness with three firms, even without capacity constraints. On the other hand duopoly solutions are not unique.</br>
