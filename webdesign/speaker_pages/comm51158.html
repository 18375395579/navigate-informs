<br>Title: An Analysis of Assortment Choice in Grocery Retailing</br><br>Author: Sri Devi Duvvuri, Asst. Professor, SUNY at Buffalo, 215 Jacobs, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, sduvvuri@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kyuseop Kwak, Gary Russell</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Consumers in grocery retailing commonly buy bundles of products to accommodate current and future consumption. The model, a new specification of the multivariate logistic market basket model, is based upon the assumption that the utility of purchase of one item in an assortment depends upon the set of items already selected.  We show that product choice is affected by brand-quality perceptions and that reaction to reductions in variety in the category is mediated by brand quality perceptions.</br>
