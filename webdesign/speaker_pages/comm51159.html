The retailer decides whether to share a private imperfect demand signal with any of the two manufacturers. We consider two cases where the manufacturers face either economies or diseconomies of scale in production. We show how production economies/diseconomies, competition intensity and information contracting influence the firms?equilibrium decisions as well as their profits.
