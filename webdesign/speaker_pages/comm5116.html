Title: United We Stand, Divided We Fall: Strategic Supplier Alliances under Default Risk<br>Author: Xiao Huang, Assistant Professor, John Molson School of Business, Concordia University, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd W., Montreal, QC, H3G 1M8, Canada, xiaoh@jmsb.concordia.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Tamer Boyaci, Mehmet Gumus, Saibal Ray, Dan Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study alliance formation among a set of complementary/substitutable suppliers selling to an assembler/buyer. The suppliers balance the strategic benefit of joining large alliances (lower chance to default) vs operational benefit to stay with small alliances (higher profit allocation). Coalition-proof stable alliance structures are characterized. We also find that the stakeholders?investment strategy in upstream risk construction can have contrasting impact on the supplier community.
