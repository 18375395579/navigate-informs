<br>Title: Charitable Intent and Bidding in Charity Auctions</br><br>Author: Michael H. Rothkopf, Professor, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, rothkopf@rutcor.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Popkowski Leszczyc</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We modeled and conducted controlled field studies of regular and charity auctions.  Results indicated that charity auctions had fewer bidders but higher revenue.  The data are consistent with our model in which bidders in charity auctions act like volunteer shills, increasing prices.  Bidders in charity auctions paid relatively higher prices for common value items and frivolous items.</br>
