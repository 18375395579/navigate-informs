The supplier operates in a batch-production mode with a supply capacity constraint. Orders from long lead-time customers can be satisfied in the next production cycle; while orders from short lead-time customers have to be satisfied from the on-hand inventory.  We characterize the optimal production-inventory policies.</br>
