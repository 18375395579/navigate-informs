<br>Title: Carbon Mitigation and Competition</br><br>Author: Zachary Gillerlain, University of Cincinnati, 2925 Campus Green Dr, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, United States of America, gillerzc@mail.uc.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider two firms in a single product environment. Using stylized models, we seek to determine the optimal number of stores for two competing firms in a carbon-regulated environment. We quantify the carbon impact of competition and we compare the actions of the firms to the actions that would be employed by a social planner under several carbon mitigating policies.</br>
