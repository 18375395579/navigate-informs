Title: Perpetual vs. Subscription Licensing of Software with Network Externalities<br>Author: Jennifer Zhang, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Arlington, 701 S. West St. #520, Box 19437, Arlington, TX, 76013, United States, jiezhang@uta.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abraham Seidmann<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper looks at a software vendor who can sell or lease his product, where he guarantees that the subscribers will always have the latest version of the software. We demonstrate how a software vendor can manage the trade-offs of selling and leasing to achieve a higher profit, as well as the corresponding welfare effect on consumers. Our paper also contributes to durable goods theory by showing that network externalities have a significant effect on the vendor’s licensing decisions.
