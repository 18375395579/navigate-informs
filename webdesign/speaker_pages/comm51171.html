Title: Competing with Bandit Supply Chains<br>Author: Meng Li, Phd Student, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, mxl086000@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Suresh Sethi, Jun Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study competition between a mainstream firm and a decentralized bandit supply chain. Due to the free-riding effect, the bandit supply chain may even offer higher quality products than the mainstream firm. Finally, the mainstream firm's profit as a function of the free-riding effect is U-shaped, so that free-riding by the bandit supply chain may eventually benefit the mainstream firm.
