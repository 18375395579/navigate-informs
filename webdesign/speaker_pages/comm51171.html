Due to the free-riding effect, the bandit supply chain may even offer higher quality products than the mainstream firm. Finally, the mainstream firm's profit as a function of the free-riding effect is U-shaped, so that free-riding by the bandit supply chain may eventually benefit the mainstream firm.</br>
