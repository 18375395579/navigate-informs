We focus on the joint pricing and inventory problem for a given assortment, under a highly accurate Taylor-like approximation. We show that the expected profit is unimodal in the price and analyze the effect of inventory on pricing. Then, with no approximation, we analyze the joint assortment and inventory problem, and derive novel insights.</br>
