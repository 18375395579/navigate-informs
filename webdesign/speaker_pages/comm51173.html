Title: Joint Pricing and Inventory Decisions under Poisson Decomposition with Insights on Optimal Assortment<br>Author: Bacel Maddah, Associate Professor, American University of Beirut, Bliss Street, Beirut, Lebanon, bm05@aub.edu.lb<br>Coauthor(s): Ebru Bish, Hussein Tarhini<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider substitutable retail products in a market with logit choice, demand generated by Poisson decomposition, and a newsvendor-type supply setting. We focus on the joint pricing and inventory problem for a given assortment, under a highly accurate Taylor-like approximation. We show that the expected profit is unimodal in the price and analyze the effect of inventory on pricing. Then, with no approximation, we analyze the joint assortment and inventory problem, and derive novel insights.
