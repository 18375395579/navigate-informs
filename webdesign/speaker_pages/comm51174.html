Two different scenarios are considered with deterministic and stochastic quality where the service provider’s effort is hidden. We compare and contrast different pricing schemes in terms of profits and quality offered to both types of consumers and identify the benefits and costs of hidden effort. We provide managerial guidelines for pricing of services.</br>
