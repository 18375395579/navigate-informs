Title: Pricing Services with Uncertain Quality to Heterogeneous Customers<br>Author: Sampath Rajagopalan, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, Los Angeles, United States of America, Srajagop@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hao Zhang, Guangwen Kong<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider optimal pricing of outsourced services such as web design to two types of consumers with different valuations for service quality. Two different scenarios are considered with deterministic and stochastic quality where the service provider’s effort is hidden. We compare and contrast different pricing schemes in terms of profits and quality offered to both types of consumers and identify the benefits and costs of hidden effort. We provide managerial guidelines for pricing of services.
