Title: Asymmetric Location Competition<br>Author: H. A. Eiselt, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada, haeiselt@unb.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Vladimir Marianov<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This presentation considers the standard Hotelling competitive model in which competitors follow different objectives. One of such cases would be a state run school in competition with private schools. We look at service levels to customers and different entry sequences: first public then private and first private then public.
