The firm decides which subset of products to offer to each arriving customer. The optimal policy is to offer all available products if the customer base is homogeneous. However, with multiple customer segments characterized by different product preferences, it may be optimal to limit the choice set of some customers. Using a case study, we find that the revenue impact of assortment customization can be significant.</br>
