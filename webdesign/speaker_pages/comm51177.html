These PUs are not continuously using their capacity. Since sectrum capacity is scarce, operators allow secondary users (SUs) to use spectrum whenever PUs are absent. However, if the PU returns when a SU is present, costs are encountered due to the PU's service degradation.    We study dynamic pricing for SU channel access, where the price dynamically varies with the expected time that the PU remains absent.</br>
