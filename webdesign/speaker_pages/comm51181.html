Title: A Decision Analysis Approach to Valuing Real Options<br>Author: Ross Shachter, Associate Professor, Stanford University, Department of Management Science and Eng, Huang Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, shachter@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Derby<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We extend the standard finite-state multiple-period model of investment in a real option by including return to scale (RTS), the derivative of the buying price with respect to the scale of investment.  RTS is either constant or decreasing, depending on whether all of the investment risk can be hedged, as assumed in financial option pricing theory.  RTS increases with wealth and trading frequency.  We provide bounds and approximations for the investment value without imposing constant RTS.
