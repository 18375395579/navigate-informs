Title: Carbon Penalties and Supply Chain Emissions<br>Author: Xi Chen, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, chen1644@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Saif Benjaafar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the impact of carbon penalties on firms?operations and the overall emissions of supply chains. Surprisingly, we show that imposing a penalty on the emissions of each firm can lead to higher overall supply chain emissions. We then explore how to devise emission penalty schemes to mitigate this adverse effect. Moreover, we show that a differentiated penalty is socially more desirable than a penalty that treats the emissions of all firms the same.
