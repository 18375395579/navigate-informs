Title: Value of Information in a Three-Player Environment<br>Author: Manoj Vanajakumari, Texas A&M University, 3367 TAMU, Collge Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, manojuv@neo.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Subodha Kumar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this research we study a supply chain system in which a manufacturer has two suppliers -- a low cost supplier (S1) and a high cost supplier (S2). S1 has a dedicated capacity for the manufacturer; however, S2 allocates capacity for the manufacturer based on a forecast provided. In a given period, the manufacturer has to optimize the fraction of the demand allocated to S2 while S2 has to find the capacity allocated for  the manufacturer. In such a setting we study the value of information.
