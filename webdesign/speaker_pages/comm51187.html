Title: Parameterized Supply Function Bidding: Equilibrium and Welfare<br>Author: Ramesh Johari, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Center, Room 319, Stanford, CA, United States, ramesh.johari@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Tsitsiklis<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate a model where the market operator can  the supply functions available for use in bidding by generators.  Such an approach has the benefit of controlling the exercise of market power, but the potential for a loss of market efficiency.  We show that with an appropriately chosen class of supply functions, both the loss of efficiency and the price markup above competitive levels can be bounded at equilibrium.
