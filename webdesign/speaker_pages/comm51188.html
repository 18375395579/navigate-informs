<br>Title: Modeling Market Share Risk in the Event of Supply Chain Disruption</br><br>Author: Mahesh M V, Doctoral Student, IIM Bangalore, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore, 560076, India, maheshm04@iimb.ernet.in</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The paper develops a framework for the modeling and analysis of impact of supply chain disruptive events on the market share of firms in product markets. Evidence from multiple case studies suggest that supply chain disruption would lead to market share loss.The model thus looks at the competitiveness angle in the case of disrption risk in supply chains. The product market is characterised and risk management decisions are presented in such cases.</br>
