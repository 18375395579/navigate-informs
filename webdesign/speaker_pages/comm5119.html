Title: Lead Time, Allocation Rules and Component Cost in the Value of Component Commonality<br>Author: Yao Zhao, Rutgers University, 180 University Ave, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States, yaozhao@andromeda.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeannette Song<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Component commonality has been widely recognized as a key factor in achieving product variety at low cost. The existing results were built primarily on models with zero lead times. In this talk, we consider dynamic systems with positive lead times. We find that component sharing alone need not yield inventory benefits. Component costs, lead times and component allocation rules all play significant roles in determining the value of common components.
