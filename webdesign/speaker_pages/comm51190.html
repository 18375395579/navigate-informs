Title: Design of Efficient Procurement Contracts under Asymetric Supplier Cost Information<br>Author: Enis Kayis, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, ekayis@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erica Plambeck, Feryal Erhun<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We search for simple yet effective procurement contracts for a manufacturer to offer a supplier who is privately informed about the production cost. The theory of the optimal incentive contracts under this asymmetric information setting is well-established. However the contracts in the real world frequently take simpler forms than what this theory predicts. In this research, we show the existence of simple contracts that are near-optimal.
