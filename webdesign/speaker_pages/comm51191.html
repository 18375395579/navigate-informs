Title: Optimal Design of Sales Contracts Under Information Asymmetry<br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, Doctoral Candidate, Stern School of Business, New York University, 44 W. 4th Street KMC 8-152, New York, NY, 10012, United States, ychen0@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sridhar Seshadri<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain with one manufacturer and multiple dealers.  Each dealer faces a geographically dispersed market with uncertain demand, and is able to observe demand signal and exert effort to increase sales in her local market. When the dealers¡¦signals are correlated, we show that the manufacturer may be able to fully extract dealers¡¦surplus by designing appropriate mechanisms, even when the sales outcomes are probabilistic and both signal and effort are unobservable.
