<br>Title: Contracting for Supply in an Unpredictable World</br><br>Author: Fang Liu, Assistant Professor, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Business School, Singapore, Singapore, Liu_Fang@ntu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tracy Lewis, Jing-Sheng Song</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A group of retailers contract with a manufacturer for the eventual delivery of materials over T future time periods. They each undertake private investments to provide for and utilize the manufacturing capacity. We identify dynamic agreements that induce uncooperative members to make efficient private investments and capacity allocation decisions under unpredictable and unverifiable market conditions. We demonstrate the supply agreement through IFRC's warehouse capacity allocation problem.</br>
