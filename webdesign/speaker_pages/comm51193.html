<br>Title: Multi-Market Pricing and Supply Strategy: Market Dependence and Competition</br><br>Author: Yimin Wang, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, W.P. Carey School of Business, Department of Supply Chain Management, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, Yimin_Wang@asu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Offshoring production to lower cost countries has often been suggested to lower the domestic market price. We prove that this observation may not hold when firms sell in both domestic and foreign markets, even if the firm is not resource constrained. We fully characterize the firm’s optimal multi-market supply strategy and investigate how market structure and competition influence the firm’s procurement and selling decisions. In doing so, we obtain a number of managerial and policy implications.</br>
