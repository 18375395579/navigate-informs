The   strategy is based on a data mining model for predicting price in competing auctions in a forward-looking manner. In order to make accurate decisions, the model needs information as input, ideally real-time information that is most up-to-date. In this research, we investigate the costs of such information in making bidding decisions and their impact on extracting maximum consumer surplus.
