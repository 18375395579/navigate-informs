<br>Title: Data Mining, Automated Bidding and the Cost of Information</br><br>Author: Wolfgang Jank, University of Maryland, 4322 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, wjank@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Louiqa Rashid, Shu Zhang, Avigdor Gal</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss an automated bidding strategy for online auctions. The   strategy is based on a data mining model for predicting price in competing auctions in a forward-looking manner. In order to make accurate decisions, the model needs information as input, ideally real-time information that is most up-to-date. In this research, we investigate the costs of such information in making bidding decisions and their impact on extracting maximum consumer surplus.</br>
