Title: Bargaining With A Residual Claimant: An Experimental Study<br>Author: Kyle Hyndman, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 West Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, kyle.hyndman@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Embrey, Arno Riedl<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Often when two parties bargain, one side is exposed to risk while the other is not. Theory provides conditions for which the residual claimant is better off when facing risk. We conduct an experiment to test this prediction and also whether residual claimants choose riskier distributions over which to bargain. We show that residual claimants are often better off being exposed to risk but, in a follow-up, also show that they are reluctant to choose riskier distributions.
