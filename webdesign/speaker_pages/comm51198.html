Simon Hall, Rochester, NY, 14627, United States, ZHOUJ2@simon.rochester.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Harry Groenevelt<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain involving 3 parties: retailer, manufacturer and bank. The mfr sells her products through a channel retailer whose ability to finance inventory is limited. In order to sell more product, the mfr partners with a bank to offer a loan program to the retailer. We formulate the interaction between retailer, mfr and bank as a Stackelberg game, compare the results with “open account financing?provided by the mfr, and consider contracts to coordinate this 3-party supply chain.
