When the firm commits to a decision and informs customers about it, the firm hides a smaller part of its queue than it would do in a market with non-strategic customers. On the other hand, when customers do not know the exact decision of the firm, the firm hides its queue more aggressively as a response to strategic customer behavior. In fact, the firm may choose to hide its queue almost completely.</br>
