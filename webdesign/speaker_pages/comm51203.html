<br>Title: Optimal Operational versus Financial Hedging for a Risk-averse Firm</br><br>Author: Wanshan Zhu, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 50 Stamford Road #04-01, 178899, Singapore, adamzhu@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roman Kapuscinski</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine a Multinational Risk-averse firm who produces and sells goods at home and overseas over multiple periods.  The firm faces risks in uncertain exchange rate, as well as uncertain demand.  The firm may use financial hedging and operation hedging to reduce these risks. Our paper models these two hedging tools in a make-to-order system and identifies the favorable conditions where one hedging is more beneficial than the other.</br>
