Title: Competition and Contracting in Service Industries<br>Author: Gabriel Weintraub, Columbia Business School, gweintraub@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ramesh Johari<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Two different contractual structures are commonly observed in service industries with congestion: 1) service level guarantees (SLG), where firms are responsible for investing so that the congestion level is equal to the SLG; and 2) best effort service, where firms provide the best possible service, but without guarantees. In this paper we analyze the impact of these contractual agreements on market outcomes in oligopolistic industries, yielding insight into business and policy considerations.
