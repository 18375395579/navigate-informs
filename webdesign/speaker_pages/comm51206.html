We consider consumer concerns as depreciated satisfaction for the products of recovery shop. A mathematical model is developed to analyze the impact of price and collection effort of the original manufacturer on collection and recovery activities of independent agents. We showed that consumer preferences and pricing policy of both parties affect their profits nonlinearly.</br>
