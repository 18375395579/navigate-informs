Title: Pricing and Revenue Management with Operational Statistics<br>Author: George Shantikumar, Professor, IEOR Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, jgshant@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Leon Chu, Max Shen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Problem of deciding the price and order quantity in inventory control based on past data is considered. When the demand is an exponential stochastic function of price, we find operational statistics for the optimal price and order quantity. Numerical results show that the proposed solution results in an expected profit that is substantially better than those realized with classical approaches.
