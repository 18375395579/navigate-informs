Our model predicts that an individual's order is irrationally increasing in past purchasing costs, decreasing in past selling prices, and decreasing in the proportion of high profit margin to low profit margin products in the portfolio. Three laboratory experiments support the model's predictions. Finally, we analytically investigate the implications of the model to a supply chain.</br>
