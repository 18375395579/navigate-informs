In the context of tiered and tail-based pricing structures, we examine the optimal responses of consumers in non-strategic as well as  strategic regimes where payoffs across consumers may be coupled by a coincident peak tariff. We further investigate the optimal design of the prescribed pricing structures in such settings. The results are supported by some preliminary numerics.</br>
