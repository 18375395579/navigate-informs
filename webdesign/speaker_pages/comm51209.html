Title: Pricing of Service in Clouds: Optimal Response and Strategic Interactions<br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Pennsylvania State University, 353 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, udaybag@engr.psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Cheng Wang, George Kesidis, Bhuvan Urgaonkar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Cloud providers are faced by a diversity of pricing structures to discourage high demands or mitigate volatility. In the context of tiered and tail-based pricing structures, we examine the optimal responses of consumers in non-strategic as well as  strategic regimes where payoffs across consumers may be coupled by a coincident peak tariff. We further investigate the optimal design of the prescribed pricing structures in such settings. The results are supported by some preliminary numerics.
