Title: Equilibrium Exploding Offers<br>Author: John Mamer, Professor, University of California, Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management, Los Angeles, CA, 90064, United States of America, john.mamer@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A seller with a single unit for sale encounters a sequence of potential buyers.  Each buyer offers a price and a duration over which the offer is valid: either indefinitely or only at the instant of the encounter (a so called exploding offer).  This paper models the situation as a game with incomplete information and focuses on the buyers' equilibrium choice between exploding and non-exploding offers, taking the offers sizes as exogenous.
