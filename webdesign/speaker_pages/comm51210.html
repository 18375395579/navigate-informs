In these industries, we can neither estimate the demand curve nor use price as a direct leverage to create demand. The desired revenue management model should be a combination of an adaptive pricing and discounting management policy; the mechanism to avoid a price war; and the way to collect the competitor's information. We present our solutions to these problems.</br>
