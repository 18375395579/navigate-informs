Title: Revenue Management with little price elasticity, competition, and unknow demand<br>Author: Lijian Chen, Assistant Professor, University of Louisville, 5241 Craigs Creek Dr, Louisville, KY, 40241, United States of America, lijian.chen@louisville.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present revenue management experiences in selected industries. In these industries, we can neither estimate the demand curve nor use price as a direct leverage to create demand. The desired revenue management model should be a combination of an adaptive pricing and discounting management policy; the mechanism to avoid a price war; and the way to collect the competitor's information. We present our solutions to these problems.
