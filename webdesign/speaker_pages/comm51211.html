Title: Endogenous Shifts in OPEC Market Power -- A Stackelberg Oligopoly with Fringe<br>Author: Daniel Huppmann, PhD Candidate, DIW Berlin (German Institute for Economic Research), Mohrenstraﬂe 58, Berlin, 10117, Germany, dhuppmann@diw.de<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: I proposes a two-stage oligopoly model for the crude oil market. In a game of several Stackelberg leaders, market power increases endogenously as the spare capacity of the competitive fringe goes down. I discuss how most large-scale numerical equilibrium models applied in the energy sector over-simplify and misinterpret market power exertion. Furthermore, I show that this two-stage model can be solved numerically as a MCP with heterogeneous firms and discuss uniqueness of equilibrium.
