<br>Title: Product Line Extensions and Technology Licensing with a Strategic Supplier</br><br>Author: Steve Gilbert, Sam P. Woodson, Jr. Centennial Memorial Professor in Business, The University of Texas at Austin, The McCombs School of Business, Dept. of IROM, Austin, TX, 78793, United States of America, steve.gilbert@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Liwen Chen, Yusen Xia</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider how the introduction of a low-end version of an existing product can affect an OEM's interactions with a strategic supplier.  We demonstrate how the low-end product line extension can induce a more favorable pricing from the supplier, and then show that, depending upon the cost structure and relative performance of the product line extension, the OEM may benefit even more from the low-end line extension if it is produced by a rival, even if no licensing revenue can be collected.</br>
