The latter is paid by an incentive scheme based on the performance of the fund. Manager and investor have different risk aversions; the manager may invest in a financial market to form a portfolio optimal for his expected utility whereas the investor is free to choose the incentives ?taking only into account that the manager is paid enough to accept the managing contract.</br>
