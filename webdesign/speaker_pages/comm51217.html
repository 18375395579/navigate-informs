Title: Revenue Management for Online Advertising with Impatient Advertisers<br>Author: Kristin Fridgeirsdottir, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, kfridgeirsdottir@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sami Najafi-Asadolahi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The Internet is a fast growing advertising medium. We consider a web host selling advertising space on its website. The advertisers that approach the web host are impatient and not willing to wait for their ad to be posted. We develop queueing models for the operation of the web host and derive a closed-form solution of the probability distribution for the number of advertisers in the system. We study the revenue maximisation problem of the web host and determine the optimal advertising price.
