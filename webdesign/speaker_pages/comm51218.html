Title: Bidding Decisions under Costly Information Acquisition<br>Author: Brendan See, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48104, United States of America, bdsee@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Izak Duenyas, Damian Beil<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Procurement research typically assumes that suppliers know their cost to produce an item.  While this may be true for an incumbent supplier, an entrant supplier is usually less informed.  We model this scenario and allow the entrant to learn additional information at a cost.  The entrant can learn prior to the auction or delay learning and make a less-informed bid.  We study the entrant’s strategy and evaluate how the buyer can influence this strategy through subsidies and other methods.
