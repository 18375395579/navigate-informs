Customers decide whether to advance purchase or wait until the spot period based on their expected future valuation, the advance sales price and the spot price. We consider a single inventory order decision made at a deterministic leadtime during the advance sales period. We seek to find the optimal order quantity, dynamic advance sales pricing policy, and spot price that maximize the firm’s total expected profit.</br>
