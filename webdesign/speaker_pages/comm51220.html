Title: Price and Inventory Competition Between New and Old Technologies<br>Author: Fernando Bernstein, Associate Professor, Duke University, PO Box 90120, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, fernando@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Preyas Desai<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a retailer that sells a manufacturer’s product line over multiple periods. Upon the introduction of a new product, the manufacturer sets the terms of trade and the retailer selects the price and stocking quantities for both the old and new technologies. We investigate the impact of offering competing technologies on the efficiency of the channel and on the retailer’s decisions regarding the breadth of product offerings.
