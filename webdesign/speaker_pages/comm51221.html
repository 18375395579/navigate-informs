Title: Tax-Efficient Distribution Strategy for Multinational Firms<br>Author: Maria Shunko, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, mshunko@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andy Tsay<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Risk sharing among members of a firm or a supply chain is known to be an effective coordination strategy. Tax rules link risk allocation to profit allocation, which in turn determines the taxes paid by multinational firms (MNF). E.g. a distributor that bears high risk should absorb high portion of profit; however, if this party is located in a high-tax jurisdiction, the benefit of risk sharing may be offset by the high tax bill. We model this tradeoff and find the optimal strategy for such MNFs.
