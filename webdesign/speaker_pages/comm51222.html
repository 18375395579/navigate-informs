Title: Reputation-based WDP in Collaborative Transportation Auctions<br>Author: Intissar Ben Othmane, Laval University, 2325 Rue de la Terrasse, Quebec City, QC, G1V0A6, Canada, intissar.ben-othmane.1@ulaval.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Sehl Mellouli, Monia Rekik<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a context in which shippers participate in a centralized combinatorial auction. The carriers are the only bidders of the auction and are permitted to submit shipping contracts requested by different shippers in the same package bid. We address the winner determination problem in a context where the winners are determined based not only on the ask price but also on the carriers reputation that may be different from one shipper to another.
