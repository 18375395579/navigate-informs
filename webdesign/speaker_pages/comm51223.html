Title: Pricing in a Duopoly with a Lead Time Advantage<br>Author: Victor Martinez de Albeniz, Assistant Professor, IESE Business School, Av. Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, valbeniz@iese.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We analyze the price competition between two suppliers offering two different lead-times to a buyer. The buyer replenishes inventory in an infinite horizon context, using a base-stock policy with each one of the suppliers. Based on the buyer's behavior, the suppliers set static prices that maximize their long-term average profit. We study the equilibrium of the pricing game.
