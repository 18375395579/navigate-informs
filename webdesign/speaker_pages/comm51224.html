Title: How to Design the Incentive Structure of Crowdsourcing Contest: A Structural Empirical Analysis<br>Author: Yan Huang, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, yanhuang@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tridas Mukhopadhyay, Param Singh<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a dynamic structural model of user participation in crowdsourcing-contests and present empirical evidence on how incentive structure could affect the quality of solutions. Using data from Threadless.com, we find that participants exert less effort as competition for the reward increases. In our policy simulations, we evaluate the impact of alternative incentive structures on users?participation decisions and the effort they exert in their submissions.
