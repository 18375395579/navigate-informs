<br>Title: Lumpy Capacity Investment Dynamics</br><br>Author: Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu, Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, lauren_lu@unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ulrich Doraszelski, Mark Satterthwaite, David Besanko</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a dynamic model of capacity expansion and withdrawal in a differentiated duopoly where capacity is lumpy. Strong product differentiation is associated with coordinated capacity expansion and withdrawal processes. By contrast, when product differentiation is weak, capacity-overbuilding preemption arises, but is only transitory. Firms can achieve a nearly coordinated industry capacity level by removing excess capacity voluntarily following a preemption race.</br>
