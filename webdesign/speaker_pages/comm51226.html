Title: Risk-averse Stochastic Optimization Models for Power Generation Capacity Expansion Problems<br>Author: Maria-Teresa Vespucci, Associate Professor, University of Bergamo, via Marconi, 5, Dalmine, BG, 24044, Italy, mtvespucci@tin.it<br>Coauthor(s): Marida Bertocchi, Laureano F. Escudero, Stefano Zigrino<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Multi-stage stochastic optimization models are introduced for the power generation capacity expansion problem of a price-taker power producer, taking into account regulatory constraints on CO2 emissions, incentives to generation from RES, evolution of power producer's market share and risk due to fuel price volatility, that affects the generation variable costs. Risk is accounted for by maximizing the expected profit while minimizing a suitably defined risk measure.
