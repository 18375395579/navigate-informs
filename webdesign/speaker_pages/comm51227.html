<br>Title: Price Matching under Preannounced Discounts in the Presence of Strategic Consumers</br><br>Author: Navaporn Surasvadi, PhD Candidate, New York University, 44 West Fourth St, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, nsurasva@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gustavo Vulcano</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a RM problem in which a seller operates an internal price match guarantee policy. Upon arrival, each consumer must decide either to buy at the full price or to buy later at a discount price and run a supply risk. If there is a markdown in the end, the seller will refund a fraction of the price difference to consumers who paid the full price. We analyze the equilibrium behavior of the consumers and the optimization problem of the seller, and illustrate with some numerical experiments.</br>
