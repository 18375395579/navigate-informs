Title: Price and Quantity Competition in Online Retailing: Amazon's Marketplace Contract<br>Author: Daewon Sun, University of Notre Dame, 359 MCOB, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, United States of America, dsun@nd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuying Zhao, Jennifer Ryan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the impact of Amazon's Marketplace contract, in which online retailers can list their products and ship customer orders. We formulate this problem as a three-channel competition model in which Amazon sells a given product, while an e-retailer sells the same product through both Amazon and her own online store. We model each channel as a newsvendor problem, with price and order quantity as decision variables, and we analyze the equilibrium behavior of the system.
