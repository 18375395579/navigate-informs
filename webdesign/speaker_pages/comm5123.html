Title: Behavioral Causes of the Bullwhip Effect in a Single Echelon<br>Author: Francesca Gino, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, fgino@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Two laboratory experiments on a single-echelon inventory task show that inventory durability interacts with transit lags to create order volatility that exceeds demand volatility (the bullwhip effect). Durability creates bullwhip effects because players adjust orders insufficiently to reflect current inventory and backlogs.  Transit lags exacerbate bullwhip-like effects by interfering with players?ability to correct prior errors.
