<br>Title: Advance Orders and Market Segmentation in a Multi-Product Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Holly Lutze, Assistant Professor, University of Texas, PO Box 830688, SM 30, Richardson, TX, 75083, United States, hlutze@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozalp Ozer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a multi-product manufacturer with multiple retail customers, each placing advance orders with a particular demand lead time. We determine an optimal menu of demand lead times and payments to maximize the manufacturer's benefit from advance orders. By choosing among menu options, retailers segment themselves according to the service level each provides his end customers. We explore how postponement and retailer markets affect this optimal menu and resulting supply chain performance.</br>
