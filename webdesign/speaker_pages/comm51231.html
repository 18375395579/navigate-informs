<br>Title: Integration of Inventory and Pricing Decisions with Costly Price Adjustments</br><br>Author: Sean Zhou, Assistant Professor, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Department SE&EM, Hong Kong, China, zhoux@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xin Chen, Frank Chen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a periodic-review inventory model with price adjustment  costs, that consist of both fixed  and variable parts.  The firm needs to coordinate the pricing  and  inventory replenishment decisions in each period to maximize its profit. We develop the general model and characterize the optimal policies for two special cases, namely, a model without fixed price adjustment costs and a model without inventory carryover. An intuitive heuristic for the general system is also provided.</br>
