Title: New Product Diffusion Decisions Under Supply Constraint<br>Author: Wenjing Shen, wenjings@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Izak Duenyas, Roman Kapuscinski<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the optimal pricing, sales and production decisions for a new product when capacity is limited. We generalize the Bass diffusion model by including capacity constraint and dynamic pricing. We find the optimal demand trajectory is unimodal while the optimal price trajectory can be bimodual. Moreover, pricing flexibility is more beneficial when imitation effect dominates innovation effect.
