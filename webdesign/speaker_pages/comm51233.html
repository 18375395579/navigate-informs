Title: An Automated and Data-driven Bidding Strategy for Online Auctions<br>Author: Wolfgang Jank, University of Maryland, 4322 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, wjank@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a dynamic forward-looking model for price in competing  auctions, incorporating dynamic auction features and its competitive  environment. Then, maximizing consumer surplus, we build a bidding  framework around this model that determines three decision points:  the best auction, bid-time and bid-amount. We compare our strategy  to early and last-minute bidding and find that it extracts  considerably higher surplus.
