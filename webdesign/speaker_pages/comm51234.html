Specifically, we consider how the buyer should set the service requirement (number of pre-qualified suppliers recommended), and provide incentives to motivate the PSP to better screen the recommended suppliers. We characterize the optimal decisions for the buyer under different conditions of supplier quality and cost heterogeneity.</br>
