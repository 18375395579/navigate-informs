Title: Supply Chain and Logistics Planning of Platform Products: Value of Platform Demand Information<br>Author: Evren Ozkaya, Ph.D Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 251 10th Street NW A-702, Atlanta, GA, 30318, United States, evren@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pinar Keskinocak, John Vande Vate, Michael Waithe<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this research, we investigate the value of demand information for platform products. In semiconductor industry, suppliers deliver multiple components to the OEMs at different times that are then assembled as a single platform by OEMs. We analyzed scenarios where we can use this component demand dependency to improve forecasting accuracy. We developed an integrated supply chain simulator to quantify the potential benefits of this information on Intel’s global supply chain.
