A good pricing would help the retailer in managing supply chain policies. In this presentation, models for the product line pricing for a large scale retail industry are proposed by incorporating price elasticity and the utility function coefficients in order to come up with various pricing decision options. Computational results and an empirical analysis are reported for these exact models.
