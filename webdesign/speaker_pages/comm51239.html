Title: Resources for Results: Reducing the Funding Gap for Social Development Projects<br>Author: Milind Sohoni, Indian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, 500032, India, milind_sohoni@isb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sripad Devalkar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a market-based funding approach for social ventures wherein a not-for-profit intermediary solicits resources from donors for perfectly verifiable results post implementation. We analyze if such an approach reduces the gap between supply and demand of funds for social ventures.   We answer the following questions: (i) Does an intermediary enhance welfare?, (ii) Is such a strategy sustainable and scalable?, and (iii) What is the impact of the intermediary's operational costs?
