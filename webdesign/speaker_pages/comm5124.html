Title: Consumer Learning and Queues<br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Associate Professor, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street Suite 550, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We analyze how pricing decision of a service provider and social welfare is affected by consumer behavior, when consumers have limited knowledge of a firm's service policy. If the consumers use their past experiences to learn about firm's service rate, the firm may not gain revenues, even if consumer beliefs and actions are consistent with the true service rate.
