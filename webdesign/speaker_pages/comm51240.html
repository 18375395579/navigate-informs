Title: Distribution Channel Design to Manage Supply Disruptions<br>Author: Yusen Xia, Georgia State University, Robinson College of Business, Atlanta, GA, 30303, United States of America, mgtyxx@langate.gsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haresh Gurnani, Karthik Ramachandran<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The buyer can control supply disruption risk by its choice of a distribution mechanism. One strategy includes insulating the supplier from inventory risk by acting as an intermediary. Alternately, the supplier may drop-ship products directly to the consumers. We model the distribution channel design for the buyer and study the incentive for the supplier to invest in improving reliability. Co-operative mechanisms to invest in supply reliability are also discussed.
