Each retailer privately observes her market signal and chooses to reveal her information to the common supplier.  Her information accuracy  is common knowledge.  The supplier then sets a wholesale price for the retailers.  We design an optimal, linear, mechanism that enforces truthful revelation and ensures individual rationality.  We also show that the entire supply chain is better off.</br>
