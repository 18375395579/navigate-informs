<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Control in the Presence of Strategic Consumers with Reference Effects</br><br>Author: Shining Wu, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Department of IELM, Kowloon, Hong Kong - PRC, shiningwu@ust.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rachel Zhang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a firm that sells the same versions of the product season after season. At the beginning of each season (stage 1), the firm places an order and sells the product at full price. As the sales unfolds, the firm has an opportunity to mark down the price (stage 2). Such markdowns may motivate strategic consumers to delay purchases in the future. We show that a strategic firm tends to stock less and discount less. Under some conditions, the optimal strategy has a mean-reverting property.</br>
