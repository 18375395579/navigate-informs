In this game, firms first make their inventory decisions independently under uncertain demands, and then decide collectively how to transship excess inventories to satisfy unmet demands. Instead of coalitions that are used in all previous studies, we use networks of firms as the primitive, which offer a richer representation of relationships among firms by taking coalitions as special cases.
