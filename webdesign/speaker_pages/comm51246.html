Title: Joint Inventory and Cash Management for Multi-Divisional Supply Chains<br>Author: Wei Luo, IESE Business School, Avenida Pearson, 21, Barcelona, Spain, wluo@iese.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Shang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper studies a centralized supply chain with different levels of cash concentration. For cash pooling, we develop the optimal joint inventory replenishment and cash retention policy; for transfer pricing, we derive a cost lower bound. The comparison between these two systems shows the conditions under which the value of cash pooling is most significant.
