Title: Integrated Sales and Operations Strategies for Differentiated Fresh Products<br>Author: Zhengliang Xue, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd Route 134, Yorktown, NY, 10598, United States of America, zxue@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Markus Ettl, David Yao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the coordination of pricing and inventory strategies contingent on product freshness. A retailer sells both fresh and frozen products where the fresher provides a higher quality but perishes quickly. Customers are segmented as high-end and low-end, and high-end customers are more sensitive to freshness. Customers might upgrade or downgrade their purchase if a stock-out takes place. We analyze the joint pricing and inventory decisions to maximize the expect profit under uncertain demand.
