Title: Vendor Selection, Contract Efficiency and Performance Measurement in Service Outsourcing<br>Author: Sameer Hasija, INSEAD, Fontainbleau, France, sameer.hasija@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhijian Cui<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study compares the efficacy of some commonly observed vendor selection and contracting mechanisms with respect to two key challenges in service outsourcing: vendor selection and contract efficiency. We show that competitive bidding yields good selection but contract inefficiency. In contrast, if the client establishes the contract terms then the menu it designs yields contract efficiency but poor selection.
