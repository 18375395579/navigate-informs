Title: On Efficiency of Revenue-sharing Contracts in Joint Ventures in Operations Management<br>Author: Cong Shi, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, shicong@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Wei Sun, Retsef Levi, Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study capacity planning problems with resource pooling in joint ventures under uncertainties. When resources are heterogeneous, there exists a unique efficient revenue sharing contract under proportional fairness. This optimal contract rewards every player proportionally to her marginal cost. When resources are homogeneous, there does not exist an efficient revenue sharing contract. We propose a provably good contract that rewards each player inversely proportional to her marginal cost.
