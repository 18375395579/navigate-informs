When resources are heterogeneous, there exists a unique efficient revenue sharing contract under proportional fairness. This optimal contract rewards every player proportionally to her marginal cost. When resources are homogeneous, there does not exist an efficient revenue sharing contract. We propose a provably good contract that rewards each player inversely proportional to her marginal cost.</br>
