Title: Acquisition Pricing with Future Repricing<br>Author: Robert Phillips, Nomis Solutions, robert.phillips@nomissolutions.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider setting the initial price of a fixed term service contract in the case in which future re-pricing is an option. Re-pricing may occur on a periodic basis or at the discretion of the seller. Examples of this setting include many service contracts, magazine subscriptions, bank deposits, credit lines and loans. We present a specific application to the case of credit lines.
