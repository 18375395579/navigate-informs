The framework allows us to examine the effects on systemic risk and price contagion of multilateral clearing via a central clearing counterparty (CCP). We prove existence and uniqueness of an interbank payment equilibrium in conjunction with the price impact on external assets. We find that a CCP not always reduces systemic risk and provide sucient conditions for the latter to hold.</br>
