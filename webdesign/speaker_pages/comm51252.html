Title: Systemic Risk with Central Counterparty Clearing<br>Author: Andreea Minca, Cornell University, Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, United States of America, acm299@cornell.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We measure systemic risk in terms of a coherent valuation principle. The framework allows us to examine the effects on systemic risk and price contagion of multilateral clearing via a central clearing counterparty (CCP). We prove existence and uniqueness of an interbank payment equilibrium in conjunction with the price impact on external assets. We find that a CCP not always reduces systemic risk and provide sucient conditions for the latter to hold.
