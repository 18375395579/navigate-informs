Our experiments incorporate a two period selling season during which retailers may sell items on sale. While interdependence between parties and perceptions of low retailer effort can decrease preferences for coordinating contracts, a sale period with price weakly decreasing in the amount of leftover inventory can reverse this effect.</br>
