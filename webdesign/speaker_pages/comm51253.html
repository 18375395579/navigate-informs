Title: Understanding Preferences for Suboptimal Contracts: The Moral Hazard Effect<br>Author: Wedad Elmaghraby, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, welmaghr@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anna Devlin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We examine how the moral hazard problem affects supplier preferences for economically inferior contracts. Our experiments incorporate a two period selling season during which retailers may sell items on sale. While interdependence between parties and perceptions of low retailer effort can decrease preferences for coordinating contracts, a sale period with price weakly decreasing in the amount of leftover inventory can reverse this effect.
