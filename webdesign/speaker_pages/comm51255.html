Title: Optimal Advertising Policy in the Presence of Pre-Launch Effects<br>Author: Dongling Huang, Assistant Professor, Renssalear Polytechnic Institute, Lally School of Management, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, huangd3@rpi.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this paper we investigate the optimal advertising policy in a monopolistic market where advertising starts before the product’s launch in order to generate interest in the product under consideration. We show that the optimal advertising policy may be increasing during the pre-launch period, but decreasing in the post-launch period. The majority of the literature shows that when pre-launch effect is not considered, optimal advertising policy is either decreasing or increasing monotonically.
