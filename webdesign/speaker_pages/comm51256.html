Suppliers sell components at a wholesale price that depends on component quality. The quality of the end product is determined by the quality of the individual components. The manufacturer seeks to maximize profits by trading off quality and component cost. This creates competition among the suppliers. We analyze possible contractual agreements in the channel.</br>
