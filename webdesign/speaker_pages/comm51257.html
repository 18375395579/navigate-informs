Title: Assortment Optimization under General Choice<br>Author: Srikanth Jagabathula, New York University, Kaufman Management Center, 44 W 4th Street, Rm 8-74 KMC, New York, NY, 10012-1126, United States of America, sjagabat@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vivek Farias, Devavrat Shah<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the classic decision problem of static assortment optimization: find an offer set that maximizes revenue subject to a constraint on its size. We assume access to only revenue estimates for different offer sets. Finding the optimal solution in general requires exhaustive search over offer sets. We propose an approximation algorithm with far fewer calls to revenue function than exhaustive search requires. We also establish theoretical and exhaustive empirical analysis.
