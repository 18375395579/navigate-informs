During each round an agent can only trade up to a certain number of contracts.  In such a market, the logarithmic market scoring rule’s price converges to the median of agents?private information for an odd number of agents, and to a point in the so called median interval for an even number of agents.  We also show that the equilibrium price does not change even when agents revise their beliefs using price data.</br>
