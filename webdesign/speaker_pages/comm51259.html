<br>Title: Sequential Demand Learning and Dynamic Pricing</br><br>Author: Rene Caldentey, Assistant Professor in Operations Management, Stern School of Business, New York University, 44 West Fourth Street, KMC 8-77, New York, NY, 10012, United States, rcaldent@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victor Araman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A retailer is planning to introduce a new product into the market but does not know if there is enough demand and decides to test the market. He chooses a small set of representative locations (learning phase) where he offers the product for a short time. Based on this information he decides whether to launch the product in the entire market (revenue phase) or not. We assume that initial inventory is fixed and that dynamic pricing is used in both the learning and revenue phases.</br>
