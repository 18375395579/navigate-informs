Title: Peer-to-peer File Sharing and the Market for Digital Information Goods<br>Author: Andres Hervas-Drane, Ph.D. Candidate, Harvard Business School / UAB, 6 Mount Auburn St. Apt. 6, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, andresonline@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Ramon Casadesus-Masanell<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study competitive interaction between two alternative models of digital content distribution: peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing and centralized client-server distribution. We present a stylized model of p2p file sharing to analyze the optimal strategy of a profit-maximizing firm, such as Apple, that offers content at positive prices. We show that the firm may be better off setting high prices, allowing the network to survive, and that the p2p network may work more efficiently in its presence.
