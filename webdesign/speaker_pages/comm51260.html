<br>Title: Approximation and Online Algorithms for Item Pricing</br><br>Author: Avrim Blum, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Computer Science, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3891, United States, avrim@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maria-Florina Balcan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of a seller with various goods attempting to set prices to maximize revenue, when customers have valuations over sets of items.  Our main result is a simple O(k) approximation for the case of single-minded bidders who each want at most k items, improving on the O(k^2) bound of Briest and Krysta.  We also show how our algorithms can be combined with results of [BH05,KV03] to achieve good performance in the online setting.</br>
