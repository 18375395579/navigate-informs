We propose an alternative methodology incorporating price, transfer cost, and trade flow data. An application to the pipeline connecting Belgium and the UK demonstrates that: (i) both markets have achieved a high degree of spatial integration, and (ii) the assumption of perfectly competitive arbitrages is firmly rejected by the data, suggesting the presence of market power.</br>
