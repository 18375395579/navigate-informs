Title: Natural Gas Trade within the EU: A Competitive and Spatially Integrated Single Market?<br>Author: Olivier Massol, Assistant Professor, IFPEN, 228-232 avenue Napoléon Bonaparte, Rueil-Malmaison, 92852, France, olivier.massol@ifpen.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Albert BANAL-ESTANOL<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Existing empirical analyses of spatial market relationships do not consider arbitrage behavior. We propose an alternative methodology incorporating price, transfer cost, and trade flow data. An application to the pipeline connecting Belgium and the UK demonstrates that: (i) both markets have achieved a high degree of spatial integration, and (ii) the assumption of perfectly competitive arbitrages is firmly rejected by the data, suggesting the presence of market power.
