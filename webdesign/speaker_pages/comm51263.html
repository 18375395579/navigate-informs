The seller negotiates the selling price with each buyer.  We embed the Nash bargaining model in a dynamic and stochastic model where the seller dynamically optimizes the minimum acceptable price in each negotiation.  We study properties of this model and show that its optimal value functions are higher than those obtained from the traditional posted-price model.</br>
