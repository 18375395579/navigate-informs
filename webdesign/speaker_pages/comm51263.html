Title: Stochastic and Dynamic Price-Based Revenue Management with Nash Bargaining<br>Author: Nicola Secomandi, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, ns7@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Atul Bhandari<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the classical setting of a firm that sells a finite inventory of a single product within a finite number of periods.  The seller negotiates the selling price with each buyer.  We embed the Nash bargaining model in a dynamic and stochastic model where the seller dynamically optimizes the minimum acceptable price in each negotiation.  We study properties of this model and show that its optimal value functions are higher than those obtained from the traditional posted-price model.
