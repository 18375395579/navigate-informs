Title: The Impact of Information Leakage on New Product Development in a Duopoly Market<br>Author: Weiyu Tsai, Assistant Professor, University of Utah, Department of Management, 1645 E. Campus Center Drive, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States, mgtwt@business.utah.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ted Klastorin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the introduction of a new product with a finite life span in a duopoly market.  An innovator firm begins developing a new product; after a random time, information about the innovator’s product “leaks?to an imitator firm who begins designing a competing product of its own.  We model this process as a Stackelberg game and show that an equilibrium solution exists for reasonable product costs, development times, and consumer preferences.
