Title: Should Event Organizers Prevent Resale of Tickets<br>Author: Yao Cui, University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, cuiyao@umich.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We are interested in whether preventing resale of tickets benefits the capacity providers for sporting and entertainment events. Common wisdom suggests ticket resale is harmful. Surprisingly, we find that this wisdom is incorrect when event organizers use fixed pricing policies. We propose ticket options as a means to increase event organizer revenues.
