Title: Shopbots and Online Consumer Search<br>Author: Jie Zhang, Jennifer.zhang@utoledo.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Online price comparison agents (shopbots) allow consumers to instantaneously receive price and other information from many online retailers. Intuitively consumers are expected to search less because shopbots have displayed prices and other relative information from retailers on the search result page(s). Surprisingly, this study demonstrates consumers are actually visiting more online retailer web sites after using shopbots. The empirical finding is explained by an analytical model.
