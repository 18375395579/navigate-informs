Title: Pricing IT Investment Risks Involving Consumer Adoption Benchmarks<br>Author: Michel Benaroch, Martin J. Whitman School of Management, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, 13210, mbenaroc@syr.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ajit Appari<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a linear multifactor model linking IT assets?excess returns to risk factor pricing parameters in an empirical model that leverages arbitrage pricing theory. We discuss required assumptions and a modeling adaptation that uses market data to price idiosyncratic security risk. Our empirical analysis relies on a competitive benchmark for different online channels, and shows that risk pricing parameters vary by financial services type and firm size, consistent with differences known to hold for the different sectors and size groups.
