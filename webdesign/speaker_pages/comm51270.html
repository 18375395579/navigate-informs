Title: Continuous Improvement in JIT Logistics: The Defect Bullwhip Effect<br>Author: Young Ro, University of Michigan, yro@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kuo-Ting Hung<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In the supply chain literature, little work has been done on modeling the propagation pattern of quality defects in supply chains.  We quantitatively model a defect bullwhip effect in supply chains that can be addressed logistically by reducing time intervals between product deliveries.  We also consider production characteristics such as the frequency of supplier failure and stringency of the buyer’s inspection process.  Implications for managers are suggested.
