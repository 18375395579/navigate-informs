An opportunity existed to selectively optimize price for merchants based on certain attributes.  A statistical segmentation was developed following which non-linear differential price elasticity function was built. For each segment, price elasticity along with an optimization algorithm with complex constraints was developed to optimize price and achieve optimal revenue.</br>
