This allows them to change the assortment more frequently, which induces repeated visits to the store, which in turn increases sales. We propose a customer consumption model with satiation and multiple competing retailers. The model implies that consumers will spend more at retailers that revise their assortment more often. We then determine the competitive equilibrium and the optimal assortment duration.</br>
