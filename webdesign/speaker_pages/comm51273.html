Title: Perspectives on the Future of Pricing<br>Author: Andrew Boyd, aboyd@prosrm.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Every company that exists sells something, and in doing so sets a price for what it sells. This gives rise to a variety of ways to “price?and “sell,?many of which have received little research attention. We begin by taking a look at demand curves (price response functions) and their practical and theoretical limitations. We then survey some business models where the use of demand curves is inappropriate.
