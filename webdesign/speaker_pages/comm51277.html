<br>Title: Information Asymmetry with the Presence of Spot Market</br><br>Author: Xuan Zhao, Associate Professor, Wilfrid Laurier University, 75 University Ave.W., Waterloo, ON, N2J4Y8, Canada, xzhao@wlu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Xing</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the effect of information asymmetries (in both demand and the spot price) on the members of a two-stage supply chain in the presence of spot market. Using a novel method to obtain the posterior bivariate normal distributions, we model the information  updating Stackelberg game and derive the unique equilibrium strategies. We then explore when the supplier intends to use a forward contract, whether a better demand/spot price forecast always preferred.</br>
