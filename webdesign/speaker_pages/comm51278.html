<br>Title: The Perils of Rationing under Consumer Regret and Misperception of Availability</br><br>Author: Yanchong Karen Zheng, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 100 Main Street, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, yanchong@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozalp Ozer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the impact of consumers?regret and misperceived product availability on a firm’s inventory decision under a markdown policy. We show that both factors greatly reduce the need for rationing. They act as complements on the seller's profit when consumers are modestly risk-averse and markdown is substantial. In contrast, they act as substitutes for highly risk-averse consumers. Ignoring these factors can subject the seller to the peril of over-rationing and lead to excessive profit losses.</br>
