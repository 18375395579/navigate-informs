Title: Managing Returns Policy and Product Resale<br>Author: Yong Lei, Student, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Department of IELM, Kowloon, Hong Kong - PRC, ylei@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Qian Liu, Stephen Shum<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the firm's problem when product can be resold either by firm or by consumers. The firm sells products with returns policy. Consumers with uncertainty about whether the product will fit them decide whether to purchase the products and then whether to return them to the firm or resell directly on their own if the products don't fit their needs. The firm's optimal pricing decision is derived. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consumer resale behavior will generally harm the firm's profit.
