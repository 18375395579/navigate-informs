Title: Price Containment in Cap and Trade Policies<br>Author: Yihsu Chen, Assistant Professor, University of California, Merced, 5200 N.

We examine the effect of a price ceiling & floor on the investment of new capacity. Besides undesirable emission consequences, we find that the price-ceiling could also lead to over-investment due to the inflated consumption induced by low power prices when the permit prices are capped. On the other hand, a permit floor would result in an under-investment in new capacity.
