Title: Mix, Cost and Time Flexibility: Valuation and Trade-offs<br>Author: Jiri Chod, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, United States of America, chodj@bc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nils Rudi, Jan Van Mieghem<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We assess the joint impact of different flexibility types on the value of a two-product firm that makes capacity, output and pricing decisions at three time epochs with an underlying continuous-time information evolution. We show that mix and cost flexibilities are substitutes in creating value but both are complementary to time flexibility. We discuss implications of these results for the trade-offs faced by managers when deciding how much to invest in different aspects of flexibility.
