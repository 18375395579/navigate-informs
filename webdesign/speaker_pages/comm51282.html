Title: Creating an Optimal Negotiation Strategy for Consumer Lending<br>Author: Frank Bria, Sr. Vice President, Response Analytics, Inc., 7426 E Stetson Dr., Ste 120, Scottsdale, AZ, 85251, United States of America, frank.bria@responseanalytics.com<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Early attempts at price optimization for consumer lending left institutions with no flexibility and average prices for average customers. This approach resulted in lost volume or sub-optimal profits. Recently, new approaches to deal-level optimization that account for individual borrowers?price elasticity and product preferences lead to a three-stage approach to developing optimal product offerings and pricing. A brief introduction to the theory and a case study from auto lending is presented.
