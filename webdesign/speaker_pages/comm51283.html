We show that the second-price auction minimizes revenue among all efficient auction mechanisms in which only the winner pays, and the price only depends on the losers' bids. We compute bidding functions and revenue of the k-th price auction for an illustrative example much used in the experimental literature to study first-price, second-price and English auctions.</br>
