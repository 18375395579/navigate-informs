Title: Two-dimensional Percentile-based Price Optimization<br>Author: Huaiyu Ma, Statistician, GE Global Research, 1 Research Circle, Niskayuna, NY, 12309, United States of America, mah@research.ge.com<br>Coauthor(s): Deniz Senturk, Kareem Aggour<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In order to effectively understand a market, target and actual prices need to be considered simultaneously. We developed a Model-Based Clustering technique to identify market-defined segments in this two dimensional space. Optimal target prices are then determined by a percentile-based pricing policy. The new method takes into account the interaction between target and actual prices and thus gives more realistic and actionable suggestions than other techniques.
