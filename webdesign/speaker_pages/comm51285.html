When the OEM cannot remanufacture, we allow a third-party remanufacturer in the market. Questions we raise include:When should an OEM with in-house remanufacturing capability remanufacture under different legislations?If the OEM cannot remanufacture, when should he sell cores to a remanufacturer?Does imposing remanufacturing targets always increase the remanufacturing level?</br>
