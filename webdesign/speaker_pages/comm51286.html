The firm determines the acceptance sampling plan and the supplier determines the quality effort level in either a simultaneous or a Stackelberg leadership game. We identify the Nash equilibriums, and show the firm's and the supplier's optimal strategies are sensitive to both the recall loss sharing ratio and the game format.</br>
