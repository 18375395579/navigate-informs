Title: Multilateral Contracting and Prevention<br>Author: Andrew Johnson, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX, United States of America, ajohnson@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abhijit Deshmukh, James Rohack, Brandon Pope<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a health insurer acting as a principal who is contracting with two agents, a health care consumer and a health care provider. We focus on the trade-off between ex ante moral hazard and insurance, and consider both consumer and provider incentives to solve the problem of optimal contracting in the presence of unobservable preventive efforts. Our results give a contract design which could be implemented by an insurer to optimally induce efforts from both agents.
