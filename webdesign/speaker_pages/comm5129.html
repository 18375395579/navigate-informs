Title: Supply Chain Structure: Minimizing Costs while Maximizing Disaster Response<br>Author: Jon Stauffer, Indiana University, 1309 East Tenth Street, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, stauffer@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alfonso Pedraza Martinez, Luk Van Wassenhove<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We model centralized, decentralized, and hybrid International Humanitarian Organization (IHO) vehicle supply chains and propose the idea of a “temporary network hub?in a major disaster area. This “temporary hub?also helps by decreasing the negative effect of earmarked funding on operational efficiency. We use actual vehicle demand from the International Federation of the Red Cross to feed our models and provide additional insights into IHO supply chains.
