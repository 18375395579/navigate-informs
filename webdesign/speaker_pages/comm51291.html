Title: Strategic Investment in Renewable Energy Sources<br>Author: Sam Aflaki, HEC, France, aflaki@hec.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Serguei Netessine<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We model the tradeoff between investing in an intermittent renewable technology (such as wind) and a reliable non-renewable technology (such as natural gas). Motivated by existing electricity markets, we analyze the effectiveness of carbon pricing strategies to promote renewables in several interrelated contexts including: (a) vertically integrated supplier, (b) market competition and (c) long-term fixed-price contracts for renewable electricity.
