Title: Optimal Capacity, Product Substitution, and Demand Models<br>Author: Juqi Liu, Ph.D Student, Virginia Tech, liujq@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rawee Suwandechochai, Ebru Bish<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a firm that produces two substitutable products. We consider linear demand models with cross-price effects under both additive and multiplicative shocks. The firm needs to make capacity, production, and pricing decisions.  While the capacity decision has to be made ex-ante, price and quantity decisions are ex-post. We study the relationship between different aggregate linear demand models and the optimal capacity as product substitution changes.
