Title: Increased Remanufacturing through Take-Back Legislation and Competition<br>Author: Gokce Esenduran, Fisher College of Business, Ohio State University, Columbus, United States of America, esenduran_1@fisher.osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jayashankar Swaminathan, Eda Kemahlioglu-Ziya<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in a market regulated with take-back law that holds the OEM responsible for taking back and properly treating the used products. We model the competition between an OEM and an independent remanufacturer as a Stackelberg game where the OEM is the leader. We find that under competition, regulation may cause a decrease in remanufacturing levels. Also, the same level of regulation may induce higher remanufacturing in the presence of competition.
