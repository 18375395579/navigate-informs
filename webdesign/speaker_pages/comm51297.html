The intensity of competition among hospitals was measured by objective and subjective measures. The relationship between competition and efficiency was examined by controlling the effects of demand and supply characteristics of the market and hospital traits. Tobit results showed competition did not have a significant relationship with hospital technical efficiency.</br>
