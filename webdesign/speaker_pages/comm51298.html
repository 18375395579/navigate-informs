<br>Title: Assortment Planning and Customer Segmentation</br><br>Author: Denis Saure, Assistant Professor, University of Pittsburgh, 1042 Benedum Hall, 3700 O'Hare Street, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, dsaure@pitt.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of a retailer facing heterogeneous consumers with initially unknown preferences. The retailer might customize offerings based on available profile information. However, users with different profiles might behave identically, suggesting that no all information is relevant. Thus, the retailer might benefit from pooling customers with similar behavior. We propose policies that dynamically adjust customer segmentation to maximize cumulative revenue.</br>
