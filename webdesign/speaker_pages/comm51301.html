<br>Title: Technological Change: A Burden or a Chance</br><br>Author: Verena Hagspiel, Associate professor, NTNU Norway, Alfred Getz vei 3, Trondheim, NO-7491, Norway, v.hagspiel@uvt.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Kort, Claudia Nunes Philippart</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of a firm that produces with a current technology for which it faces a declining sales volume. It has two options: it can either exit this industry or invest in a new technology with which it can produce an innovative product. The resulting new market can be booming or ends up to be smaller than the old market used to be. We derive the optimal strategy of a firm for each scenario and specify the probabilities with which a firm would decide to innovate or to exit.</br>
