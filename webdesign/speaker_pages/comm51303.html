<br>Title: How Social Reputation Networks Interact with Competition in Anonymous Online Trading</br><br>Author: Gary Bolton, Professor, Penn State University, United States, gbolton@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Claudia Loebbecke, Axel Ockenfels</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Many Internet markets rely on ‘feedback systems? essentially social networks of reputation, to facilitate trust and trustworthiness in anonymous transactions. Market competition creates incentives that, in theory, may enhance or may curb the effectiveness of these systems. We investigate how market competition and social reputation networks interact to affect trust, trustworthiness and gains-from-trade in a series of laboratory online markets, where sellers face a moral hazard.</br>
