Title: Dual Sourcing and Supplier Improvement under Supply Risk<br>Author: Yimin Wang, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, W.P. Carey School of Business, Department of Supply Chain Management, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, Yimin_Wang@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wendell Gilland, Brian Tomlin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The existing literature treats supplier uncertainty as exogenous. Yet, industry evidence suggests that many firms can influence supplier uncertainty through supplier improvement efforts. In this research we relax the exogenous assumption in supply uncertainty and connect the diversification strategy with the process improvement strategy. We characterize the firm’s optimal strategy and obtain a number of important managerial insights.
