Customers are uncertain about valuations and product quality until the spot. We characterize the seller's strategy under two scenarios: (i) the seller can ration capacity in advance and (ii) rationing is not allowed. We find that capacity rationing is an effective signal of quality and characterize when the seller should signal through rationing.</br>
