Title: Computing Default Probabilities for a Three Level Supply Chain<br>Author: Nesim Erkip, Bilkent University, Dept. of IE, Ankara, TR, 06800, Turkey, nesim@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Sila Cetinkaya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider a buyer facing random demand, a first tier supplier(OEM manufacturer) and a second tier supplier (supplier of the OEM). We investigate the effect of buyer sharing her demand information with the supply chain under arbitrary contract structures all enforcing total satisfaction of the random demand. We are especially interested incomputing default probabilities of different parties, as well as the default probability for the supply chain.
