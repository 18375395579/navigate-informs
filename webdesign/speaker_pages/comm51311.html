Title: Strategic Learning by e-Service Suppliers in Service Value Networks<br>Author: Steven Kimbrough, U. of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, kimbrough@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christian Haas, Clemens van Dinther<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine strategic behavior of e-Service suppliers that offer electronic services in complex Service Value Networks (SVNs). We study two specific learning regimes (a genetic algorithm and the Probe and Adjust learning algorithm) that can handle the associated complex strategy space.  Our results show that even with relatively simple learning regimes, e-Service suppliers are able to find beneficial offers and learn to collude tacitly (and presumably legally), which increases their profits.
