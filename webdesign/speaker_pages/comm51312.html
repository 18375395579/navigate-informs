However, is a better recommender system always beneficial for a firm? To study this question, we consider monopolistic and duopolistic markets where customers are heterogeneous in their search costs. We derive conditions and provide managerial insights for situations when improving recommendation systems may increase or decrease profits of firms in these markets.</br>
