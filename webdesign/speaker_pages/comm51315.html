<br>Title: Competition in Prices and Service Level Guarantees</br><br>Author: Gabriel Weintraub, Columbia Business School, gweintraub@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ramesh Johari</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a model of oligopoly competition for service industries where providers choose prices and service level guarantees. Consumers are sensitive to the sum of price and the congestion experienced. We show that this game can be reduced to standard oligopoly models, greatly simplifying the analysis. For example, for loss systems it is equivalent to a standard pricing game with constant marginal costs. We conclude by comparing this game to one where firms set prices and investment levels.</br>
