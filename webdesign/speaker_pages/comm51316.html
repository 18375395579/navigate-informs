Different from the majority of the literature, a cost is incurred if there is a price change. The objective is to find a pricing and ordering plan so as to maximize the total profit over the planning horizon. Under rather general assumptions, we develop polynomial time algorithms to solve the model, which interestingly vary significantly with the cost structure.</br>
