<br>Title: Optimal Dynamic Return Management of Fixed Inventories</br><br>Author: Mehmet Sekip Altug, Assistant Professor, George Washington University, 2201 G. Street, NW, Washington, DC, United States of America, maltug@gwu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a retailer that sells a fixed amount of inventory over a   finite horizon. We assume that return policy is a decision variable which can be changed dynamically at every period. While flexible return policies generate more demand, it also induces more returns. We characterize the optimal dynamic return policies based on two costs of return scenarios. We find out how these policies change with inventory and time. We extend our model to multiple competing retailers.</br>
