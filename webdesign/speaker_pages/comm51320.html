<br>Title: Optimal Product Line Design for Consumer Durables: An Integrated Marketing and Design Approach</br><br>Author: Lan Luo, Assistant Professor of Marketing, University of Southern California, 3660 Trousdale Parkway, ACC 301F, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, lluo@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Babak Besharati, P.K. Kannan, Shapour Azarm</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Historically, product line design was considered as selecting the best K products from a set of N candidate products. However, a subjective prior selection of the N products can result in a suboptimal product line. In particular, the performance of consumer durables can vary across different conditions. We adopt a Genetic Algorithm optimization to identify a set of robust products. Next, a combinatorial optimization is used to construct a product line. Our approach was implemented by a US firm.</br>
