<br>Title: Procurement Auctions with Uncertain Demand and Supplier Capacity Investment</br><br>Author: Cuihong Li, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT, United States of America, Cuihong.Li@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Scheller-Wolf</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a buyer who sources a customized item via an online procurement auction. The buyer faces uncertain demand and the winning supplier has to invest in capacity. While the commonly used open descending price auction provides an efficient process to negotiate the price, it ignores the allocation of demand and capacity risks. We examine the performance of such auction with the buyer offering price-only push vs. pull contracts. We also compare such auctions with optimal auction mechanisms.</br>
