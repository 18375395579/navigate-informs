<br>Title: An Experimental Analysis of Bidding Behavior in Competing Auctions</br><br>Author: Thayer Morrill, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, thayer_morrill@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Hammond</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Theoretical results predict a focal equilibrium for an auction with simultaneous traders; it is weakly dominant for each bidder to bid on the lowest price unit and submit a bid equal to the price of the second lowest unit.  We test how bidders actually formulate their bidding strategies in such a market.  Although the above equilibrium is in weakly dominant strategies, it is not unique. We test if this strategy is in fact focal to uncover the nature of bidding behavior marketplaces such as eBay.</br>
