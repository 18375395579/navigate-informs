<br>Title: Pricing Time-Sensitive Services Based on Realized Performance</br><br>Author: Philipp Afeche, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St.George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S3E6, Canada, Philipp.Afeche@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Opher Baron, Yoav Kerner</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Services such as Fedex charge an upfront fee but reimburse customers if their orders are delayed. In contrast, most studies of congestion pricing restrict attention to the upfront fee but ignore the possibility of subsequent price adjustments based on realized performance. This paper contributes to filling this gap. It studies for a provider who serves multiple classes of time-sensitive customers the optimal design of more general price contracts that also charge based on actual performance.</br>
