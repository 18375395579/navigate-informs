Title: Product Line Design and Capacity Planning under Demand Uncertainty<br>Author: Sergio Chayet, Olin Business School, Washington University in St Louis, Saint Louis, MO, 63130, United States of America, chayet@wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis, Dennis Yu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We analyze product line and capacity decisions faced by a firm selling vertically differentiated products to customers who are heterogeneous in their design quality valuations.  We consider two sources of aggregate demand uncertainty: Market potential and market size. The firm commits to capacity and design quality decisions before demand is realized and sets prices ex post.  We generate analytical results for optimal decisions and study the effect of each type of market uncertainty.
