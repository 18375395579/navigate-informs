Bogazici University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Bebek, Istanbul, xx, 34342, Turkey, taner@boun.edu.tr</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We investigate technology investment and capacity decisions of a telecom operator under different scenarios. In all scenarios, uncertain demand is positively affected by successful technology adoption. This, in turn, has an effect on peak capacity design decision. We formulate the problem in a decentralized setting under vertical and horizontal competition and show that variants of profit sharing contracts coordinate such systems.</br>
