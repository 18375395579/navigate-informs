Title: Cost-per-click Pricing for Display Advertising<br>Author: Sami Najafi-Asadolahi, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, Sami.Najafi@rotman.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Kristin Fridgeirsdottir<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We determine the optimal cost-per-click (CPC) price of display ads for a web publisher facing uncertain demand from advertisers requesting space on its website and uncertain supply of clicks from viewers. We formulate the problem as a queuing system. We show that the frequently used heuristic applied by most web publishers to convert between the CPC and CPM pricing schemes using the so-called click-through-rate can be misleading and may incur web publishers substantial revenue loss.
