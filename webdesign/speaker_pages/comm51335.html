Title: Experimental Evaluation of Quantity-discount and Price-only Contracts Under Asymmetric Information<br>Author: Feryal Erhun, Assistant Professor, Stanford University, MS&E, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, ferhun@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Basak Kalkanci, Kay-Yut Chen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study all-unit quantity discount (QD), incremental QD, and price-only contracts in a setting where a manufacturer, who is better informed about demand, procures a component from a supplier. With experiments, we test the relative performance of all-unit and incremental discounts (theory predicts that all-unit discount leads to higher profits) and the effect of number of price breaks (theory predicts that increasing the number of price breaks leads to higher profits) on supplier’s profits.
