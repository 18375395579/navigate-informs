But little is known about the magnitude of these costs in electronic markets. Using a dataset collected from Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, we use product-level price and demand data to estimate these costs. We also identify the impact of search costs on market competition by exploring a unique insight of Stiglitz (1989) that search costs create kinkiness in aggregate demand when firms change prices.</br>
