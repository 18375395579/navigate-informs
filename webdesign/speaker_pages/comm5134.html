We have approached the pricing problem by formulating two models, one to forecast demand during clearance sales, and the other to optimize the markdown decisions with a finite horizon in mind. The main challenge in the forecasting model has been to overcome the lack of pricing data due to Zara's single-price policy during the regular season.
