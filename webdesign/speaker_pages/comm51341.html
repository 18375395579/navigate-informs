<br>Title: Revenue Management in the Presence of Staying Customers</br><br>Author: Lei Xie, Dr, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Room 307, 1954 Hua Shan Road, Shanghai, Shanghai, China, leixie.nhb@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaoying Liang, Houmin Yan, Yimin Yu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The well-observed staying (screening-and-waiting) behavior has received little attention in revenue management. We consider two inventory models characterized by a personalized pricing and a dynamic pricing strategies, respectively. We show that the optimal selling strategy is a static multi-level protection policy. By evaluating models with/without staying customers, we report the importance of including the staying behavior in revenue management models.</br>
