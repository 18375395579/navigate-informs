By defining flexibility on a continuous spectrum to allow it to affect production cost after demand uncertainty is resolved, we completely characterize flexibility and expected profit of firms with asymmetric cost structures, and discuss the effects of demand, competition, decision sequence, and cost parameters on flexibility, capacity and profitability.</br>
