Our goal is to study how the network structure of the market and the role of middlemen  influence the market's  efficiency and the fairness.  We introduce the concept of limit stationary equilibrium for a general trading network and use it to analyze how endogenous delay emerges in trade and how surplus is shared between sellers and buyers.</br>
