Title: Bargaining with Middlemen<br>Author: Randall Berry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, rberry@ece.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Thanh Nguyen, Vijay Subramanian<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamics and decentralized market modeled by  a non-cooperative networked bargaining game. Our goal is to study how the network structure of the market and the role of middlemen  influence the market's  efficiency and the fairness.  We introduce the concept of limit stationary equilibrium for a general trading network and use it to analyze how endogenous delay emerges in trade and how surplus is shared between sellers and buyers.
