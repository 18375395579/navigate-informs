<br>Title: Valuing Information Plans versus Discrete Information ?Setting Management Expectations to Lower Information Costs</br><br>Author: Ellen M. Coopersmith, Decision Frameworks, Inc., ellen@decisionframeworks.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Those of us who make the effort to value information often do so comparing discrete information choices ?do we want to run a long or short test or a small versus a large pilot?  This often results in the comparison of less reliable, but less expensive information to more reliable, more expensive information - and leads to the acquisition of the most reliable and expensive information source, which can be justified for the cost.      However, with better understanding of how to utilize the results of the reliability of information estimate and value-of-information approach, teams can evaluate and recommend more cost effective INFORMATION PLANS.  This means teams recommending, and managers funding, information plans ?rather than the most reliable information, which can be justified, pre-acquisition.  Information plan approval often involves immediate funding for less information, and secondary funding for more information, contingent on interpretation results of the initial information in the plan.     This case study reviews how information is valued, the role of the reliability of interpretation estimate in information valuation, and the use of the results of that estimate to determine when additional information might be valuable.  Moreover, it underscores that it is often not a matter of acquiring one information source or another, but under what interpretations will additional, sequential information be valuable. In this example, we consider a short versus a long test and look at the reliability, cost and value of each, and compare that to the expected cost and value of a well-designed testing plan.  More importantly, the presentation will end with a conversation on how to facilitate the “information plan?funding conversation with management ?clearly recognizing that some aspects of this approach are unconventional in many organizations across a gambit of industries.</br>
