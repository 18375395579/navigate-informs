Title: Buy Now and Match Later: The Impact of Posterior Price Matching on Profit with Strategic Consumers<br>Author: Guoming Lai, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, pittsburgh, pa, 15213, United States of America, laiguoming@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Katia Sycara, Laurens Debo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: With a posterior price matching policy, a seller guarantees to reimburse the price difference to a consumer who bought the product before the seller marks down. In this talk, we examine the impact of a posterior price matching policy on consumers' purchasing behavior, a seller's pricing and inventory decisions, and their expected payoffs. We find that the price matching policy eliminates strategic consumers' waiting incentive and thus allows the seller to increase the price.
