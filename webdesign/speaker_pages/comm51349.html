Title: Dynamic Bargaining in a Supply Chain with Asymmetric Demand Information<br>Author: Guoming Lai, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, Austin, TN, United States of America, guoming.lai@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Qi Feng, Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study supply contracting with dynamic bargaining under asymmetric information. The buyer knows the demand state (either high or low), while the seller knows only the prior. We characterize a unique equilibrium for a seller-initiating game, where either both buyer types accept the offer immediately, or only one type accepts immediately while the other rejects and counteroffers an acceptable contract. We apply our model to study the effect of demand forecasting accuracy on firm profitability.
