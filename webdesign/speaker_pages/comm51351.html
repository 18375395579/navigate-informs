Companies that poorly manage demand variability report high supply chain costs and low profit levels. In this paper we make a conscious decision about admitting demand variability to the supply chain. By observing the impact of demand patterns on the efficiency of the supply chain, we derive an optimal distribution channel strategy that trades off between market size and demand variability.
