Recent years have witnessed an extensive study of NVs under competition. Most of the literature, if not all, has assumed NVs' objectives are to maximize profits. In reality, however, many inventory managers' objectives are to achieve the pre-determined profit and (or) revenue targets. This paper aims to understand competitive NVs with profit or profit and revenue satisficing objectives.</br>
