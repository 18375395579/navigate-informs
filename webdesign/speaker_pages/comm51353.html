Title: Bounded Rationality in Strategic Interactions in Supply Chain<br>Author: Basak Kalkanci, Massachusetts Insitute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, kalkanci@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Despite the standard assumption of perfect rationality in theoretical models, decision  makers are often boundedly rational and are subject to errors and biases, particularly in  interactions with other decision makers. We examine how bounded rationality drives the  interaction of multiple players in supply chain to find out (1) how much is lost by assuming perfect  rationality and (2) whether bounded rationality can work as an advantage for a decision maker.
