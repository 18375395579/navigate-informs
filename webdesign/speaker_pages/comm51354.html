Title: Interplay Between Operational Flexibility and Financial Hedging<br>Author: Jan Van Mieghem, Harold L. Stuart Distinguished Professor of Managerial Economics, Professor of Operations Management, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, MEDS Department, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-2009, United States, VanMieghem@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jiri Chod, Nils Rudi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate the relationship between operational flexibility and financial hedging. Flexibility influences (i) the firm's need to hedge by affecting profit variance, (ii) its ability to hedge by affecting hedging efficacy, and (iii) its valuation of hedging by increasing the firm's wealth.  We show that flexibility and hedging tend to be complementary (substitutes) in reinforcing (mitigating) each other's marginal effect on the mean-variance criterion (expected exponential utility).
