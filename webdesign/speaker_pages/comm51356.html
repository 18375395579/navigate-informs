Title: Lateral Transshipment Options in a 2-Stage Supply Chain<br>Author: Gary Gaukler, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, gaukler@tamu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In this talk, we model the behavior of a 2-stage supply chain in which lateral transshipments at the second stage installations are possible. Lateral transshipments can be used to quickly react to demand (and supply) uncertainty. We derive a compound inventory control policy to determine when transshipments should be initiated and evaluate the impact on system performance.
