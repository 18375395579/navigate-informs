Title: Reference Price Comparison, Mental Accounting, and Anomalies in Consumption-Payment Decisions<br>Author: Woonam Hwang, PhD Student, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, whwang.phd2009@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Manel Baucells<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We propose a positive theory of consumer choice. When evaluating the hedonic benefits of consumption and payment decisions, consumers engage in a double comparison: one between the benefit of consumption and the reference price, and another between the reference price and the actual price. These comparisons are governed by proposed laws of mental accounting. Under standard assumptions, our model predicts various consumer choice anomalies such as sunk cost effects and the flat-rate bias.
