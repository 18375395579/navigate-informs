<br>Title: Dynamic Model of Quality Improvement in Manufacturer-supplier Contract</br><br>Author: Sidong Zhang, Ph.D Candidate, Syracuse University, 721 University Ave., Syracuase, NY, 13244, United States, szhang01@syr.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Usually quality is a static requirement in a contract rather than an evolving process, though quality improvement is a continuous process.

This paper studies the supplier’s quality improvement decision making behavior given the dynamic contractual mechanism.</br>
