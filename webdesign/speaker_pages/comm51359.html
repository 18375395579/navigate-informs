<br>Title: Joint Stocking and Product Offer Decisions under the Multinomial Logit Model</br><br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Cornell University, 223 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, ht88@cornell.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a stocking and product offer problem, where we need to decide which sets of products to offer over the selling horizon and how many units of each product to stock given that customers choose among the offered products according to the multinomial logit model. We give a formulation of the problem with a separable objective function, which allows solution via dynamic programming. We study the properties of the optimal assortment.</br>
