O'Neal, oneal.jerry@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Jacob, Adam Farmer, Kristi G. Martin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Airlines form alliances to expand the network of markets each carrier can serve through a process known as codesharing.  Codesharing allows a carrier to place its marketing code on alliance partner's flights.  Codeshare flights can then be sold by a carrier even though they are operated by their alliance partner. Alliances can improve the revenue streams of their members; however, the amount of revenue increase depends significantly on which flights are chosen for codeshare.  A codeshare flight profitability system can automate the codeshare selection process by choosing a set of codeshare flights that maximize total system revenue for a carrier while satisfying the rules that have been set by the alliance, the government and the airlines' unions.</br>
