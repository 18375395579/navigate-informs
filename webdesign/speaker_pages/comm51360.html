Often the dealer exerts a large effort towards the end of the incentive period resulting in the hockey stick phenomenon (HSP.)  We characterize the form of the HSP and show how to control it using a signal correlated with the underlying demand.  We then study the impact of dealer competition on the HSP.  We also study the impact such incentives on the overall sales of the manufacturer.</br>
