Title: Competition and Coordination in a Two-Channel Supply Chain<br>Author: Elodie Adida, University of California at Riverside, School of Business Administration, Riverside, United States of America, elodieg@ucr.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amy David<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study competition and coordination in a supply chain in which a single supplier both operates a direct channel and sells its product through multiple retailers competing in quantities. We develop equilibrium strategies for the decentralized supply chain and, finding that such a supply chain is inefficient, we investigate the conditions under which revenue sharing, linear quantity discount, and linear price discount sharing contracts can act as coordination mechanisms.
