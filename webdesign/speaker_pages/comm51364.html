We investigate the efficiency of a unit penalty contract under three broad categories of supply risk: random capacity (RC), random disruption (RD) and random yield (RY). We find that a unit penalty contract always coordinates the supply chain under RC and RD, but it does not under RY, and the performance depends on the timing of the reliability investment.</br>
