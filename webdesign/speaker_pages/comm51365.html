We investigate an industry with two supply chains that Bargain on the Wholesale price and show that both the MS and the VI are special cases of this contract.  We characterize the unique Nash Equilibrium for the strategies of both chains and, surprisingly, show that VI of both chains is never equilibrium.</br>
