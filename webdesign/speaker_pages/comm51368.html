Title: Optimal Bulk to Case Product Mix in a Supply Chain<br>Author: Ananth Iyer, Professor, Purdue University, Rawls Hall, Room 4001, 100 S Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, aiyer@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joo Yol Maeng<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We model the optimal choice of production in bulk or in individual product in the presence of demand forecast errors, production cost differences and inventory control choices.  The model suggests that demand correlation with forecast, inventory turns and production variation may determine the benefit to product postponement.  Data from a bottling company is used to estimate the impact of such strategies.
