Title: Newsvendor Mergers<br>Author: Xin Wang, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, xinwang1@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Soo-Haeng Cho<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study how a merger of two price-setting competitive newsvendors will affect the prices, inventories, and expected profits of merging newsvendors and their competitors in an oligopolistic market. By evaluating the pooling effect of a merger and stock-out competition under uncertain demand, we demonstrate that demand uncertainty, which has been ignored in the economics literature, can have a significant influence on both direction and magnitude of the impact of a merger.
