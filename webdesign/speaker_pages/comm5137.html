Title: Capacity Management with Strategic Customers<br>Author: Haiyan Wang, Washington University in St. Louis, Olin Business School, 1 Brookings Dr., St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States of America, hwang27@wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tava Olsen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a service provider managing capacity in the presence of demand surges. Under this strategy, some customers who arrive in the peak demand period are offered a discount if they are willing to be postponed to a non-peak period. However, some non-peak period customers are strategic and may pretend to be a peak period customer in order to obtain a discount. We analyze the effect of the strategic customers?behavior on the service provider’s capacity decisions and postponement strategy.
