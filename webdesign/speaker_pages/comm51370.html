<br>Title: Targeted Coupon Distribution Using Social Networks</br><br>Author: Srinivas Shakkottai, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, Room 332C WERC, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843-3128, United States of America, sshakkot@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lei Ying, Ramesh Johari, Sanjay Shakkottai</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Traditional targeted marketing either involves self identification of users, or mining social networks. We consider the scenario of a store that distributes discount coupons without such knowledge. Coupons can be transferred between friends. We propose a back pressure algorithm by which user preferences can be identified, and coupons can be transfered in a multihop fashion. We also study incentives for truth telling and compensation of users based on their impact on system performance.</br>
