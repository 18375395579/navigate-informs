Title: A Model for Competition in Network Airline Revenue Management<br>Author: Nishant Mishra, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, nmishra.phd2003@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Victor de Miguel<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider oligopolistic competition in network revenue management. Starting with a Cournot type capacity competition, for such a system, we show the existence and uniqueness of Nash Equilibrium under certain regularity conditions. Our approach is using Variational Inequalities and we also discuss how this analysis can be extended to the case of Bertrand price competition. Finally, we present results from numerical experiments and discuss how competition can affect revenue management practice.
