Title: Turf Wars: Brand Extensions in Markets with Preference Based Segmentation<br>Author: Yogesh Joshi, Assistant Professor, University of Maryland, 3301 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, yjoshi@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Reibstein, John Zhang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Firms often need to decide how narrow or broad the scope of their brand should be. Some firms choose a narrow scope and are careful to not stake a claim in the competitor's turf, whereas other firms offer a broad scope and introduce innovations that encroach on the competitor's turf. We investigate the conditions under which these strategies are optimal, when firms face distinct market segments and are able to distinguish between own and rivals' customers.
