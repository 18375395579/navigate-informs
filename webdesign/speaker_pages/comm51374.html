However, negative network externalities on the consumption side and operational issues (such as yield uncertainty) on the supply side do not provide the incentives required to reach the socially optimal vaccine coverage. We investigate how a central policy-maker can induce a socially optimal coverage through the use of a two-part subsidy scheme.</br>
