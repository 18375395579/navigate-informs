Spencer Standish Associate Professor of Operations Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, georgiap@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elodie Adida</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a make-to-stock manufacturing system where demand is a linear function of the price, with uncertain parameters. We consider a dynamic setting where multiple products share production capacity. A key part of the model is that no backorders are allowed. We consider and compare various approaches that deal with demand uncertainty and give rise to closed loop policies such as adjustable robust optimization and dynamic programming. We discuss our insights.</br>
