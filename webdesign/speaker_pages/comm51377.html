<br>Title: Designing Customer Return Policies to Optimize Overall Channel Profitability</br><br>Author: Prashant Yadav, Professor of Supply Chain Management, MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, Zaragoza Logistics Center, Zaragoza, AR, 50009, Spain, pyadav@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sweta Thota</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A large fraction of the return flows in the supply chain consist of non-defective returned products. Using different consumer choice models, we investigate the impact of credit returned and duration of return time allowed on the profits of retailers and manufacturers. The insights are useful for retail managers involved in setting terms of their return policy and for logistics managers in building their case for restricted returns.</br>
