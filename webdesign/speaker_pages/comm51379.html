We analyze quality promise scenario (QP), a signaling game, and quality requirement scenario (QP), a screening game. We find that under certain conditions, both QP and QR may achieve the ideal outcome to the buyer due to the competition among suppliers. Surprisingly, simple requirement strategy with no screening may outperform both QP and QR with screening.</br>
