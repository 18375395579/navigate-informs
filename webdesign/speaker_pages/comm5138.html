Title: Joint Production and Economic Retention Quantity Decisions in Capacitated Production Systems<br>Author: Abhilasha Katariya, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, Industrial and System Engineering, TAMU 3131, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, abhilashapk@neo.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eylem Tekin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider production/inventory management decisions of a firm that sells its product in two market segments during a finite horizon. The objective is to maximize the total expected net revenue by determining the optimal production  quantity in each period, and the optimal inventory amount to carry  to the next period after the sales in primary and secondary markets.  We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and establish lower and upper bounds on the optimal policy parameters.
