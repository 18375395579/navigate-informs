Title: Contracting Mechanisms for Airline Code Share Alliances<br>Author: Achal Bassamboo, Northwestern University, a-bassamboo@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sunil Chopra, Sandeep Juneja, Milind Sohoni<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study revenue-sharing contracts for airline alliances.  An airline privately observes local demand on a single leg and reveals information about remaining capacity, which is used to accept passengers with 2-flight itineraries (thru-passengers.) We show conditions under which the max-allocation contract, for thru-passengers, is an optimal truth-telling contract.  We develop conditions when the min-allocation contract achieves optimality.  We extend the results for larger alliances.
