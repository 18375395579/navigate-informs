Title: Promoting Competition in Repeated Procurement Auctions<br>Author: Gabriel Weintraub, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, gyw2105@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sachin Adlakha<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Most of the literature in auctions assumes a one shot interaction between the auctioneer and the bidders. However, in many real-world procurement settings there are many repeated interactions and suppliers make entry, exit, and other decisions over time. We introduce a novel dynamic model of repeated procurement auctions with these features. We consider commonly used mechanisms to enhance competition (subsidies, split-awards, set-asides) and study which ones lead to a lower procurement cost.
