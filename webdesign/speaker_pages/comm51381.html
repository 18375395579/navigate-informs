However, in many real-world procurement settings there are many repeated interactions and suppliers make entry, exit, and other decisions over time. We introduce a novel dynamic model of repeated procurement auctions with these features. We consider commonly used mechanisms to enhance competition (subsidies, split-awards, set-asides) and study which ones lead to a lower procurement cost.</br>
