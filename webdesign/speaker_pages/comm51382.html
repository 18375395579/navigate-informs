Title: Service Provider Competition: Delay-cost Structure, Segmentation and Cost Advantage<br>Author: Maxim Afanasyev, PhD Candidate, Stanford Graduate School of Business, 518 Memorial Way, S485, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, afanasyev@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haim Mendelson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study competition between service providers and show how the customer’s delay cost structure, market size, and differences in the providers?costs affect service differentiation and market segmentation. Additive delay costs lead to differentiation, whereas interdependence between customers?service valuations and delay costs may lead to value-based segmentation. Moreover, if the providers have different costs, the market is segmented. We show implications of the results for film production.
