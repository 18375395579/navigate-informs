<br>Title: Solution to an Infinite-Horizon Principal-Agent Problem by Direct Construction</br><br>Author: Hao Zhang, University of Southern California, 3670 Trousdale Pkwy, Bridge Hall 401, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, zhanghao@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A principal delegates the control of a Markovian system to an agent. She offers a long-term contract to the agent in order to maximize her expected profit, but the system states can only be observed by the agent. Through a two-state example, we demonstrate that the optimal contract may be directly constructed from certain pivotal points. It is more efficient than backward induction and helps uncover the structure of the optimal contract.</br>
