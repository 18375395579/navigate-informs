<br>Title: Joint Pricing and Inventory/Production (EOQ) Decisions Across Products in a Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Annie Niu, University of Alberta, School of Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada, rniu@ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuan Zhao, Ignacio Castillo</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider joint pricing and inventory/production decision problems with both complementary and substitute products in a two-stage supply chain. Demand for each product is deterministic but sensitive to the retail prices of all products. We analyze each member's pricing and inventory/production problem and found that equilibrium exists under certain conditions. The problem is also considered under VMI. We provide numerical examples that develop insights for product line and category management.</br>
