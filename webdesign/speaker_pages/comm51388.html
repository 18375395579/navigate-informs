Robinson, Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, 433 Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, lwr2@cornell.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Under consignment VMI, a vendor owns the inventory of a product, or a family of products, on the retailer’s shelves.  She restocks it periodically and is paid when it leaves is reported sold.  It will somtimes be optimal for the retailer to discard inventory off of his own shelves and report it as sold.  We construct the distribution of the retailer’s reported demand from the true demand distribution, and extend the model to allow for constraints on the shelf space for a family of products.</br>
