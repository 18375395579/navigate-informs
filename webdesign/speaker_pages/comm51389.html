Title: Product Assortment Competition with the Decoy Effect<br>Author: Anton Kleywegt, Associate Professor, ISyE - Georgia Tech, 755 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, anton@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xinchang Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Consider setting A with a low-profit product and a high-profit product, and setting B with these same products as well as an apparently irrelevant product that is clearly inferior to the high-profit product.  It has been widely observed that a larger fraction of people choose the high-profit product in setting B than setting A.  This is the decoy effect. We study product assortment competition in a duopoly with decoys among candidate products.  We characterize the Nash equilibria, and use dynamical systems models to study the evolution of the competition and the stability of the equilibria.
