It has been widely observed that a larger fraction of people choose the high-profit product in setting B than setting A.  This is the decoy effect. We study product assortment competition in a duopoly with decoys among candidate products.  We characterize the Nash equilibria, and use dynamical systems models to study the evolution of the competition and the stability of the equilibria.</br>
