<br>Title: Assortment Planning in Multiple Selling Channels</br><br>Author: Yiqiang Su, Phd Candidate, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 450 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32607, United States of America, ysu1987@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Geunes</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this research, we consider a clicks-and-mortar retailer who sells goods to end-customers through both physical and virtual (e-commerce) channels. The retailer has limited capacity, and would like to determine the set of products to offer, both in the local and online stores to maximize its profit from sales during a single selling season. MNL and Exogenous demand models are used to capture the customer choice behaviors, and a chance-constrained two stage model is built to solve this problem.</br>
