<br>Title: Too Close to be Similar: Product and Price Competition in Retail Gasoline Markets</br><br>Author: P.B. (Seethu) Seetharaman, Professor of Marketing, Rice University, Jesse H. Jones Grad School of Management, McNair Hall, MS 531, Houston, TX, 77252, United States of America, seethu@rice.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine product and pricing decisions of retail gasoline stations. We analytically show that closely located retailers who face sufficient income dispersion across consumers in a local market will differentiate on product design and pricing strategies. Using empirical survey data on prices and characteristics representing 724 gasoline stations in St. Louis, and employing a multivariate logit model, we find strong support for the central implications of the theory.</br>
