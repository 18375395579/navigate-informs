Title: Determining the Environmental Effects of a Remanufacturing Strategy for an Aluminum Automotive Powertrain Part<br>Author: Sophie Govetto, Sustainable Design and Manufacturing Group, Georgia W.

In addition to the consequential impoverishment of natural resources, this large consumption produces copious amounts of waste. This pollution and energy use can be reduced through proper reuse end-of-life strategies. Many have proposed remanufacturing as the best way to alleviate up some of these environmental burdens. In this study of an automotive powertrain part, we will compare three end-of-life strategies (disposal, remanufacturing and recycling).  This study will demonstrate that from a life-cycle perspective, remanufacturing results in less emissions and energy consumption than recycling or disposal strategies, but also that these savings in emissions can be negated by long and inefficient reverse supply chains.
