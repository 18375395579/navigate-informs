Title: Evaluating Supply Chain Decisions in the Additives Business<br>Author: Peter Schipperijn, Optimization Engineer, Chevron, 1400 Smith, Room 17137, Houston, TX, 77002, United States of America, APSC@chevron.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Chevron Oronite has developed a business economics model to help guide strategic and tactical decision making in the supply chain.  Examples of such decisions are exploring the value of manufacturing process expansion, understanding the tradeoffs of site rationalization, new sales evaluation, and product source optimization.   With after-tax profit maximization as its objective, the underlying LP technology allows potential changes in the supply chain to be evaluated holistically.
