Examples of such decisions are exploring the value of manufacturing process expansion, understanding the tradeoffs of site rationalization, new sales evaluation, and product source optimization.   With after-tax profit maximization as its objective, the underlying LP technology allows potential changes in the supply chain to be evaluated holistically.</br>
