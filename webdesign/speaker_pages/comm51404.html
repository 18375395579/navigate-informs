Title: Cost-reducing Innovation and the Role of Patent Intermediaries<br>Author: Shantanu Bhattacharya, INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Avenue, Singapore, Singapore, shantanu.bhattacharya@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sameer Hasija, Anupam Agrawal<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Patent intermediaries act as non-practicing entities, who buy innovations from an external provider and then license them to practicing firms. This paper considers the competition between two identical incumbent firms and a patent intermediary for acquiring a cost-reducing innovation from an external innovator. The analysis of the model shows that patent intermediaries participate in patent markets only if the innovation is incremental.
