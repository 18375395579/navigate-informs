Title: The Zero-day DLC Strategy: A Case for Versioning to Facilitate Product Sampling<br>Author: Atanu Lahiri, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, Box 353226, Foster School of Business, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, lahiria@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Debabrata Dey<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Out of the recent popularity of downloadable contents (DLC) among video game manufacturers has resurfaced the issue of versioning of information goods. The central idea behind the zero-day DLC strategy is that consumers who find the base version of a game to be sufficiently attractive would pay a premium to upgrade by purchasing such a DLC. We demonstrate that a manufacturer's desire to vertically differentiate this way could actually stem from a horizontal separation among consumers.
