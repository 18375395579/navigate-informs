Title: Increasing Supply Chain Robustness through Process Flexibility and Strategic Inventory<br>Author: He Wang, Massachusetts Institute of Techonology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Rm 1-249, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, wanghe@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi, Yehua Wei<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain with multiple plants producing multiple products, and a plant may fail because of disruptions. The firm can invest in process flexibility and strategic inventory. The robustness is measured by the time that elapses before the strategic inventory is used up. When demand is deterministic, we show that a little process flexibility is very effective in mitigating disruptions. However, the effectiveness decreases with demand uncertainty.
