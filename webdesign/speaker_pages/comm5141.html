<br>Title: A Product Line Extension Problem with Inventory Considerations</br><br>Author: Shan Li, Ph.D. Candidate, Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, lisapine@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a product line extension introduction problem in an   integrated inventory (supply) and diffusion (demand) framework.  The model determines whether and when to introduce the line extension and the corresponding production quantities, while accounting for substitution, diffusion and market segmentation effects.</br>
