There are three options: a core can be refurbished, harvested for spare parts or salvaged at a certain value. The demand for the refurbished products and the spare parts are uncertain over time. The core availability is limited to meet all demand. We address the problem in a revenue management framework to maximize the firm’s revenue over a T period horizon.</br>
