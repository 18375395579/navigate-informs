The more effort the demand planner invests, the better is the forecast. We analyze the effect of group identity on the effort that the demand planner invests. We develop a game-theoretical model and test the model in the lab. We find that increasing group identity increases the effort invested by the demand planner and that the production planner anticipates this effect.</br>
