<br>Title: Deploying Simulation to Compare Among Different Risk Reduction Strategies for Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Cameron MacKenzie, Assistant Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, United States of America, camacken@nps.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A firm can choose among several strategies to reduce the risk of disruptions in its supply chain, including holding inventory, buying from multiple suppliers, and helping suppliers recover. Because these risk management strategies may be non-continuous and depend on each other, simulation can be used to select a near optimal combination of strategies. We develop a conceptual framework for a firm who wishes to select resilience strategies that maximize its profit.</br>
