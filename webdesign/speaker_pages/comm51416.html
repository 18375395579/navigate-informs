Leaders choose their supply levels first, knowing demand only in distribution. Followers make their decisions after observing the leader supply levels and realized demand. We prove existence and uniqueness of equilibrium under mild assumptions, propose a computational approach to find the equilibrium, and apply this framework to model competition in the telecommunication industry.</br>
