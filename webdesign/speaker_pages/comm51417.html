Title: Capacity Reservation Contracts Using Common Agency<br>Author: Basak Kalkanci, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, Department of MS&E, Stanford, 94305, United States of America, kalkanci@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Feryal Erhun<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine how suppliers must choose their contracts in an assembly system when the manufacturer has better information on mean demand. We analyze different contracting settings based on the contract type (complex vs. simple) and contract sequence (simultaneous vs. sequential) and characterize the contracting equilibria. We identify the effects of different product and market characteristics on the value of using complex contracts and additional information.
