Title: Multi-period Inventory Models with Price Protection<br>Author: Osman Alp, Bilkent University, Industrial Engineering Department, EA421, Ankara, TR, 06800, Turkey, osmanalp@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Alper Sen, Nurdan Ahat<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In an environment with declining procurement costs and sales prices, the manufacturer offers price protection so that the retailer will maintain adequate inventory. With price protection, the retailer will be reimbursed with a percentage of the procurement cost declines, for the inventory that the retailer ordered within a given price protection period but not yet sold. We study the optimal inventory control policy of the retailer under price protection.
