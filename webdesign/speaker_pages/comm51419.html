<br>Title: Queueing Game Models for Differentiated Services</br><br>Author: Parijat Dube, IBM T J Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights NY, 10598, pdube@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rahul Jain</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop queueing game models and a framework to study competition    between network providers, each of whom offer multiple (differentiated) classes of service.We study the pricing (or Bertrand) game between the providers. A Nash equilibrium  may not exist in general but we provide sufficient conditions for its existence.</br>
