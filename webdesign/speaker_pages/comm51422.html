<br>Title: Investment and Competition in Unlicensed Spectrum</br><br>Author: Randall Berry, Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd., Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, rberry@eecs.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Increasing the amount of unlicensed spectrum for wireless services, such as the recent opening of the television white spaces in the US, has the potential to benefit customers by increasing competition, but may also increase congestion. We give a model for studying such trade-offs and consider the implications of adding such spectrum in terms of the investment and pricing decisions of wireless service providers.</br>
