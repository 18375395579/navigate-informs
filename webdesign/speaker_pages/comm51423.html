Our empirical setting involves 55 projects in 20 focal firms that outsource complex innovation work to their suppliers. We investigate the effects of two integration mechanisms used to overcome these barriers, (1) colocating firm and supplier personnel and (2) giving a “supply chain integrator?personnel that manage the DPD projects control over key aspects of their projects.
