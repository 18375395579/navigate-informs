Title: Dynamic Pricing under Demand Uncertainty in the Presence of Patient Consumers<br>Author: Benny Mantin, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, bmantin@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Yinhan Meng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the effect of consumers' patience on pricing, inventory decisions, and inventory release policies of a monopoly retailer selling a single product over two periods facing uncertain demand. We characterize situations in which the retailer may benefit from the presence of patient consumers; we find the optimal release policy for a given capacity; and we numerically demonstrate capacity decisions to maximize profit.
