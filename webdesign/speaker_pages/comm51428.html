We evaluate the impact of ad placement on revenues and profits generated from sponsored search using data from for several hundred keywords from the ad campaign of an online retailer. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we find that the topmost position is not necessarily the revenue-maximizing or profit-maximizing position.
