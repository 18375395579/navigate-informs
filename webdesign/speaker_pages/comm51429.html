Title: Information Sharing in Supply Chain of Durable Goods<br>Author: Hyoduk Shin, UC San Diego Rady School of Management, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92093, United States of America, hshin@rady.ucsd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Neda Khanjari, Seyed Iravani<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a supply chain of a durable good product consisted of a retailer with advance demand information and a manufacturer. Analyzing how the policy of the retailer to share his information with the manufacturer depends on durability of the product, we show that the retailer strategically shares his demand forecast if and only if the durability of the product is neither too high nor too low. We also present profit implications of the information sharing.
