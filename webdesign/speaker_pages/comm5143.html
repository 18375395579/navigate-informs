Title: Dynamic Pricing Under Customer Reluctance Behavior<br>Author: Victor Araman, Assistant Professor, Stern School of Business, NYU, 44 West Fourth Street, New York, NY, 10012, United States, varaman@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vladimir Krasik<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This work aims at studying a simple revenue management problem when the seller tracks reluctant customers. In a continuous time setting where arrivals of customers follow a Poisson process, the seller adjusts prices based on remaining inventory but also on number of customers that are considering buying the item. This work is driven by the advanced capabilities of online retailers to trace their potential buyers and suggest ways to incorporate this information in the pricing decisions.
