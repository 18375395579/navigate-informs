Title: Controlling for Price Endogeneity in Airline Passenger Itinerary Choice Models<br>Author: Stacey Mumbower, Graduate Research Assistant, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, stacey.mumbower@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laurie Garrow<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Although price endogeneity can lead to unrealistic and misleading model coefficient estimates, few studies have explored endogenous airline prices. A unique set of data collected from airline websites is used to build airline passenger itinerary choice models. An instrumented variable approach is used to control for factors that influence price (such as prices of other competitors and presence of a low cost carrier), allowing models to estimate the unbiased effect of price on consumer decisions.
