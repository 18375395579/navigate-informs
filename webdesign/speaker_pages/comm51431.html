Title: Sole Sourcing vs. Second Sourcing: Impact of Demand Uncertainty<br>Author: Cuihong Li, Assistant Professor, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Road, Unit 1041, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States, Cuihong.Li@business.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the decision for a manufacturer (buyer) to select between sole sourcing and second sourcing mechanisms for a component with uncertain demand. Supplier capacity investment is required before the demand is realized. The incumbent supplier achieves cost reduction from learning. We find that a high or low capacity cost may both benefit second sourcing, and second sourcing is more favorable more when the buyer faces more demand uncertainty.
