Title: Managing New Product Development with Uncertain R&D Input from a Third Party a Sequential Game<br>Author: Shantanu Bhattacharya, shantanu.bhattacharya@insead.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider two OEMs who are competing in a common market, and are developing a product jointly with a technology to be sourced from a third party. The third party has an uncertain R&D process, and the probability of successful development of the technology is increasing in the volume commitment and joint investments made by the competing OEMs.
