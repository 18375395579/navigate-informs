<br>Title: An Efficient Approach for Solving the Revenue-Maximizing Mixed Bundling Problem</br><br>Author: Mihai Banciu, PhD Candidate, University of Pittsburgh, 343 Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States, mibanciu@katz.pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Prakash Mirchandani</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The mixed-bundling problem (MB) entails finding the optimal revenue-maximizing prices for product lines consisting of individual products, or bundles of these products combined in any proportion. We investigate MB in a monopolistic setting with limited product availability, develop a decomposition approach derived from the underlying mathematical programming model, and present encouraging preliminary results.</br>
