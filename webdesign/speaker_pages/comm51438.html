<br>Title: A Behavioral Investigation of Service-Based Supplier Competitions</br><br>Author: Karen Donohue, Associate Professor, Carlson School, University of Minnesota, 321 19th Avenue S., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, KDonohue@csom.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Saif Benjaafar, Elena Katok</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We compare two types of supplier competitions that are proven, in theory, to be equally effective ways for a buyer to elicit high service quality from his supply base.  We study the two mechanisms in the laboratory to determine whether these similarities hold true with human decision-makers. We also test the effect of the number of competitors and different service cost structures on service performance.</br>
