Title: Dynamic Pricing with Learning under Two-Sided Censoring<br>Author: Li Chen, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, li.chen@duke.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: If a customer buys a product, you only know that her reservation price is greater than or equal to the posted price; if she does not buy the product, her reservation price must be below the posted price. Thus, from the seller’s standpoint, the posted price serves as either a left- or right-censoring point of the customer’s true reservation price. In this paper, we study how one can learn from such two-sided censored data and dynamically adjust prices to maximize total revenue.
