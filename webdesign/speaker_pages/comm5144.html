Title: Financial Markets Can Prevent Inefficient Entry in a Competitive Industry<br>Author: Bert Willems, Tilburg University, P.O. Box 90153, Room K324, Tilburg, Netherlands, willems.bert@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Joris Morbee<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Investments can be socially inefficient in perfectly competitive markets with homogenous goods, if firms are risk averse and financial markets are incomplete. Entrants underinvest in technologies that reduce aggregate sector risk. Inefficiencies disappear when the financial market is complete, although the introduction of individual tradable instruments may decrease efficiency.  When an entrant invests only in the financial market and not in productive assets, there are no inefficiencies.
