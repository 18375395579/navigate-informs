Title: Dealing with Supplier Bankruptcy: Costs and Benefits of Financial Subsidies<br>Author: Volodymyr Babich, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, babich@umich.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Using a firm-value model for the supplier’s bankruptcy and a dynamic, stochastic, periodic-review model for the manufacturer's joint capacity reservation and financial subsidies decisions, we quantify the benefits the manufacturer derives by subsidizing the supplier.  We provide general conditions under which the manufacturer can make capacity decisions independently from subsidy decisions and prove that the optimal subsidy policy has the “subsidize-up-to?structure.
