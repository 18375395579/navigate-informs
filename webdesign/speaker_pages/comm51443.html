However sellers tend not to adapt to competition or different market conditions. To determine sellers?profit maximizing reserve price strategies under different market conditions we build a comprehensive simulation model. This model incorporates competitive sellers and bidder segments who vary in their propensity to bid in auctions with different reserve price strategies.</br>
