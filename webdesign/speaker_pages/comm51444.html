Title: Pricing in Queues without Demand Information<br>Author: Ramandeep Randhawa, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, United States of America, ramandeep.randhawa@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Moshe Haviv<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider revenue and social optimization in an M/M/1 queue with price and delay sensitive customers, and study the performance of uninformed pricing that does not require any  arrival rate information.  For uniformly distributed customer valuations, under a large set of parameters,  we find that uninformed prices can capture more than 99% of the optimal revenue and more than 85% of the optimal social welfare.
