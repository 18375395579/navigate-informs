Title: Designing Subsidies with Industry Response Dynamics: Commitment vs. Flexibility<br>Author: Ruben Lobel, Assistant Professor, Wharton School, Philadelphia, United States of America, rlobel@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis, Maxime Cohen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Governments use consumer incentives to promote new technologies and  stimulate investments from the private sector (eg. solar panels). We model  the interaction between a government and an industry player in a multi-period  setting under uncertain demand. We show how the timing of decisions will  affect production and subsidy levels. In particular, a flexible subsidy  policy will be on average more expensive for the government than a  committed long-term policy.
