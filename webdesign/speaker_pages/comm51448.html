<br>Title: Vertical Integration in Supply Chain Networks</br><br>Author: Ming Hu, Assistant Professor, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, M5S 3E6, Canada, Ming.Hu@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Awi Federgruen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We analyze supply chain networks where at each echelon suppliers compete to sell multiple products to firms at the next echelon. The offered products are differentiated and the firms in each echelon engage in price competition. We use the model to evaluate the impact of vertical integration on equilibrium prices and product assortments.</br>
