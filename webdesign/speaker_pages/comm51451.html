Title: CoCos, Bail-in, and Tail Risk<br>Author: Nan Chen, Associate Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 709A William Mong Engineering Building, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Paul Glasserman, Behzad Nouri, Markus Pelger<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We develop a capital structure model to analyze the incentives created by contingent convertibles (CoCos) and bail-in debt, two variants of debt that converts to equity as a bank nears or reaches financial distress. We find that CoCos generally have positive incentive  effects when the conversion trigger is not set too low. A debt-induced collapse may occur when the firm takes excessive debts, changing CoCos to junior debts and reversing its incentive benefits.
