Title: Revenue Monotonicity in Combinatorial Auctions<br>Author: Baharak Rastegari, University of British Columbia, 201-2366 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z4, Canada, baharak@cs.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Leyton-Brown, Anne Condon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Intuitively, one might expect that an auction's revenue weakly increases as the number of bidders grows, as this increases competition. However, it is known that for combinatorial auctions that use the VCG mechanism, a seller can sometimes increase revenue by dropping bidders. We show that such failures of revenue monotonicity can occur under a broad class of dominant-strategy mechanisms that includes affine maximizers and mechanisms that always select strongly Pareto efficient allocations.
