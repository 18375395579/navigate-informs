According to recent work, the upstream forecast accuracy improvement is zero under a large set of parameters. We use the data from a CPG company to show the opposite result. Out theoretical model allows the decision maker to deviate away from a given inventory policy. These “decision deviations?turn out to lead to information losses, resulting in strictly positive value of downstream information.</br>
