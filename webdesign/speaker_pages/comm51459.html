Title: Newsvendor Model Under Unknown Dependency Between Inventory Decision and Demand<br>Author: Soonhui Lee, Ph.D Student, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd C151, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, s-lee4@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tito Homem-de-Mello, Anton J. Kleywegt<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study inventory problems where a decision maker determines the order quantities based on the newsvendor model under the situation of unknown dependency between decision and demand. Because the dependency is unknown to the decision maker, he believes the newsvendor model produces optimal decisions. We study how the order quantities deviate from the true optimal order quantities with repeated application of the model and show situations under which the resulting revenue can be arbitrarily bad.
