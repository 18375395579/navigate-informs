<br>Title: Multi Market Competition and Global Sourcing: The Role of Intellectual Property Protection</br><br>Author: Laurens Debo, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, laurdebo@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jiong Sun, Sunder Kekre</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop a model in which a US firm determines whether to sell products to the Chinese market in addition to the US market. If the firm decides to do so with a manufacturing facility in China, a local Chinese company may copy the US firm’s product and compete in both Chinese and US markets. If the firm decides not to do so, the US firm incurs higher production costs for both markets. We characterize the optimal entry strategy of the US firm in these global markets.</br>
