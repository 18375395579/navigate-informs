Title: A Model of Product Specification Decision-making and Project Failure<br>Author: Zhijian Cui, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, IE Business School, Calle de Maria de Molina, 12, Madrid, 28006, Spain, Zhijian.Cui@ie.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christoph Loch<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This study models the bargaining process between two parties (leader and follower) on a one-dimensional feature design decision for a new product. We examine three managerial levers to reduce the risk of bargaining failure. First, follwer can reduce the failure risk by signaling his fallback. Second, giving leader an incentive (as with a bonus) exacerbates the risk of failure. Third, if follower cares about his relative payooff or status, this also increases the risk of failure.
