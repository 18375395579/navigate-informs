The supply risk refers to long and unreliable procurement leadtimes and the demand risk refers to the firm’s uncertainty about its pre-season and in-season orders. We characterize the firm’s optimal timing and quantity decision. We prove that a firm with pre-season orders might order earlier than one without. We also prove that a firm may strictly prefer a less reliable to a more reliable leadtime.</br>
