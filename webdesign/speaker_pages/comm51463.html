Title: Dynamic Pricing and Demand Learning with Limited Price Experimentation<br>Author: He Wang, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, wanghe@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi, Alexander Weinstein<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In a dynamic pricing problem where the demand function is unknown a priori, price experimentation can be used for demand learning, but in practice sellers are faced with business constraints that prevent them from conducting extensive experimentation. We consider a dynamic pricing model where the seller can only change price for a limited number of times during the sales window.
