<br>Title: Strategies for an M/G/1 Make-to-stock Queue Serving Different Markets</br><br>Author: Baris Balcioglu, University of Toronto, 5 Kings College Rd, Toronto, ON, Canada, baris@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hossein Abouee Mehrizi, Opher Baron</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: For an M/G/1 queue serving an identical product to distinguishable and prioritized markets we choose product dispatching and base-stock levels when inventory is decentralized or centralized. We provide exact analysis (optimal base-stock levels and cost) for a decentralized policy demonstrating, numerically, its effectiveness. For a centralized system we approximate the inventory-rationing and the strict-priority policies and showing numerically that inventory rationing is more effective.</br>
