Title: Dynamic Pricing of Software as a Service in Subscription Markets<br>Author: Nabita Penmetsa, Doctoral Candidate, University of Pittsburgh, Joseph M.Katz Graduate School of Busines, Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States of America, Npenmetsa@katz.pitt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Esther Gal-Or, Jerrold May<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine the dynamic pricing problem of a firm selling a new version of software on a subscription basis. Consumers know their valuation for the existing version but are not familiar with the features included in the new version and updates available during the subscription period. Assuming consumers can learn about their valuation after one usage occasion, we examine the dynamic pricing strategies that a monopolist can exercise when he can observe the purchase history of a consumer.
