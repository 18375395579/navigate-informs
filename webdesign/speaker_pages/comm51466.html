Title: On Scheduling and Deadline Differentiated Pricing of Deferrable Demand<br>Author: Eilyan Bitar, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, eyb5@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yunjian Xu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A large fraction of total electric load is inherently deferrable in time. In the following, we propose a novel market, where consumers consent to deferred electric power service in exchange for a reduced price of energy. The longer the willingness to defer, the larger the reduction in price. We jointly characterize scheduling policies and differentiated prices that are both efficient and incentive compatible, in that every consumer would like to reveal her true deadline to the supplier.
