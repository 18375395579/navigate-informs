<br>Title: Extending the Horizons: Green Supply Chains as Driver of Operational Excellence</br><br>Author: Charles Corbett, Professor, UCLA Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Box 951481, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1481, United States of America, charles.corbett@anderson.ucla.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Companies worldwide are increasingly involved in green supply chains. Some companies are proactively encouraging better environmental practices among supply chain partners; other companies are experiencing pressure from customers or regulators. We will review examples of how supply chains in a wide range of sectors are becoming greener. We will see how greener supply chains are often also more profitable, even if these economic benefits can be difficult to predict in advance.</br>
