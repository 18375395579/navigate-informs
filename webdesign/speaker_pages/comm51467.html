Some companies are proactively encouraging better environmental practices among supply chain partners; other companies are experiencing pressure from customers or regulators. We will review examples of how supply chains in a wide range of sectors are becoming greener. We will see how greener supply chains are often also more profitable, even if these economic benefits can be difficult to predict in advance.
