<br>Title: Benefit and Coordination of Sharing Commodity Inventory</br><br>Author: Seung-Jae Park, Ph.D. Candidate, McCombs School of Business, 2110 Speed way, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Seung-Jae.Park@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guoming Lai, Sridhar Seshadri</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the benefit and the coordination of inventory sharing when there are spot and forward markets. We consider two firms that use a common commodity input to satisfy stochastic demands in a multi-period setting. We propose a simple method to coordinate inventory sharing. The proposed method is fair for the borrower and lender and seems to work very well, i.e., the procurement cost gap between the centralized and decentralized cases is dramatically small in our experiments.</br>
