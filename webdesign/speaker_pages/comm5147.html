We consider two firms that use a common commodity input to satisfy stochastic demands in a multi-period setting. We propose a simple method to coordinate inventory sharing. The proposed method is fair for the borrower and lender and seems to work very well, i.e., the procurement cost gap between the centralized and decentralized cases is dramatically small in our experiments.
