<br>Title: Setting Quality and Speed in Service Industry with Repeated Customers</br><br>Author: Azin Farzan, Student, University of Washington, Box 353226, Foster Business School, Univ. of WA., Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, afarzan@uw.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yong-Pin Zhou</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a system in which customers purchase services repeatedly. Customers benefit from a higher quality level and incur cost due to waiting. Customers choose to join the service based on the expected value of the service.  After each encounter, they repeat the purchase depending on the quality perceived. The firm invests in capacity and quality levels jointly. We analyze these decisions and their relationship. We also consider the duopoly scenario and analyze the equilibria in each setting.</br>
