<br>Title: Emissions Trading and Electricity Prices in an Agent-based Simulation Model</br><br>Author: Daniel Veit, Professor, University of Mannheim, Chair of BA and Information Systems, Schloss, Mannheim, D, 68131, Germany, veit@uni-mannheim.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anke Weidlich</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The contribution presents an agent-based simulation model of the German wholesale electricity market, which takes the market for CO2 emission allowances into account. It is analyzed how profit-seeking generator agents carry over allowance prices to electricity market bids and how this ultimately influences wholesale power prices.</br>
