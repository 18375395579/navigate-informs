Title: Stockout-Based Substitution and Inventory Planning in Textbook Retailing<br>Author: Vishal Gaur, Professor, Cornell University, Johnson School, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, vg77@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joonkyum Lee, Suresh Muthulingam<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop a utility-based choice model for the Cornell Store to estimate demand and plan inventory for textbooks in the presence of consumer choice and stockout-based substitution. Demand information is censored, time of stockout is not tracked, inventory availability is uncertain and often replenishment is impractical. Our model generates accurate demand estimates (MAPE less than 1%) even when over 90% of textbooks stockout. In a controlled field experiment our model increases profits by 10%.
