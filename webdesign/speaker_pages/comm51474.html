Title: Contracting for Cellulosic Biomass: Effects of Contract Structure and Yield Variability on Supply<br>Author: Adaora Okwo, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, aokwo@gatech.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We model land allocation to perennial energy crop production and estimate the cellulosic biomass supply under different contract payment options. Biomass supply under each option varies according to the quality of land used to grow the biomass. Using switchgrass production in Tennessee as a case study, we show that pay-per-unit biomass contracts are more effective for premium lands and short-term contracts while pay-per-acre contracts are more effective for marginal lands and longer terms.
