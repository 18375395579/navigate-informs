Puterman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a seller who, using online auctions, wishes to sell a finite number items. The decision maker must decide when to start each auction. This decision involves a trade off between excess holding cost and price cannabilzation through simultaneous auctions. We formulate the problem as a MDP and derive some structural properties of the optimal release policy. We also include an empirical validation of model assumptions using data from several thousand online consumer electronics auctions.</br>
