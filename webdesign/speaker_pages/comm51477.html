Our paper studies OTA selections of top-listed hotels. Over a period of 135 days we tracked price and OTA page-rank data for 2581 different hotels. Our analysis indicates that while OTA websites provide buyers with valuable search assistance by locating good-valued deals they also influence them to purchase relatively expensive products.</br>
