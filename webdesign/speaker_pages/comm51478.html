Title: Contracts in the Risk-averse Supply Chain<br>Author: Rockey Myall, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, rrm204@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Aurelie Thiele<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine the affect of risk aversion on supply chain contracts in a classic newsvendor model, where both retailer and supplier are risk-averse. We characterize the optimal order quantity, discuss how it differs from the risk-neutral case and provide insights into the impact of risk aversion. We also investigate the implementation of a buy-back contract in a risk-averse supply chain and describe how it relates to the issue of supply chain coordination.
