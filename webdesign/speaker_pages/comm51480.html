We consider group buying mechanisms in business-to-business exchanges with one seller and multiple buyers. Each buyer has private information regarding his valuation of the product, which varies with the number of units he acquires. We study the buyers' bidding behavior, and compare the buyers' surplus, the seller's revenue, and the social welfare under several group-buying mechanisms.</br>
