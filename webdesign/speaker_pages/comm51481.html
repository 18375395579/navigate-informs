Title: Cost Per Click Pricing for Display Advertising<br>Author: Sami Najafi-Asadolahi, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, sami.najafi@rotman.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Kristin Fridgeirsdottir<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a web publisher facing uncertain demand from advertisers requesting space through an ad network, and an uncertain supply of clicks from viewers. Formulating the problem as a novel queuing system, we show that the frequently used heuristic applied by most web publishers to convert between the CPC and CPM pricing schemes using  the so-called click-through-rate can be misleading and may incur substantial revenue loss for web publishers.
