Title: An Experimental Investigation of Buyer Determined Auctions<br>Author: Elena Katok, Associate Professor, Penn State University, 465 Business Building, Penn State University, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, ekatok@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ernan Haruvy<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We present a laboratory study of buyer determined auctions with non-monetary exogenous attributes.  We find that generally sealed-bid auctions generate higher buyer surplus levels than dynamic auctions.  We also find that when suppliers' non-monetary attributes are known to all suppliers, dynamic auctions perform particularly poorly.
