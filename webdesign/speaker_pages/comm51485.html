Title: Decision Making and Cognition in Multi-Echelon Supply Chains:  An Experimental Study<br>Author: Brent Moritz, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University, 469 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, bmoritz@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Arunchalam Narayanan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Supply chain performance often depends on the decisions of channel members.  Using a variant of the Beer Game, we find that the cognitive profile of the decision maker has an impact on performance, both for the supply chain and for a particular echelon. The effect is more pronounced in more complex problem environments. The findings have implications for supply chain design, education and industry employers.
