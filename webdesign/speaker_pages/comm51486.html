Although initially uninformed about the product quality, they learn by observing past purchase decisions and reviews of other consumers. We characterize the dynamics of this learning process for markets with high demand intensity. This analysis can be put to use to study various operational and marketing decisions (for example pricing) when consumers engage in social learning.</br>
