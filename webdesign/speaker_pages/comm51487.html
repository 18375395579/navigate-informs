Title: Integration and Bilateral Sabotage<br>Author: Hong Guo, Assistant Professor, University of Notre Dame, 356 Mendoza College of Business, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, United States of America, hguo@nd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yabing Jiang, Asoo Vakharia<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study integration of firms in two interrelated markets that are two-way essential complements. A unique phenomenon arises in this setting as the integrated firm may engage in bilateral sabotage. This paper analyzes the integrated firm’s incentives for sabotage and its impact on social welfare. Our findings provide important managerial and policy implications for integration of two-way essential complements, such as recent acquisitions and mergers in the technology sector.
