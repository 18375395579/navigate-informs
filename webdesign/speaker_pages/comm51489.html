Title: Information Acquisition and Technology Adoption<br>Author: Canan Ulu, PhD Candidate, Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, canan.ulu@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): James E. Smith<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a technology adoption model where the firm is offered a technology whose benefits are uncertain. In each period, the firm can choose to adopt or reject the technology or gather information to reduce the uncertainty about the benefits of the technology. We generalize previous technology adoption models to allow more general distributions on benefits and to allow the benefits of the technology to be changing over time. We characterize the optimal value function and optimal policies.
