It is found that such revenue sharing allows airlines and airports to internalize positive demand externality, which could lead to substantial welfare gains. However, such practice may cause negative effects to airline competition. In addition, while sharing concession revenue with airlines an airport may still prefer to increase airport charge.</br>
