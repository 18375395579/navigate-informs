At the beginning of the time horizon, the firm invests in a capacity which can be used to produce two substitute products of which the total demand evolves in time. At sometime near the end of the horizon, the firm makes commitment decisions on both quality level of and volume of capacity committed to each product. At the end of the horizon, the firm observes the total demand and makes the production and pricing decisions.</br>
