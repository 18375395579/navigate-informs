Optimal Assortment under Product Returns<br>Author: Alex Grasas, University of Florida, Department of Industrial & Systems, Engineering, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, agrasas@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elif Akcali, Aydin Alptekinoglu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Motivated with the question of whether retailers should consider product returns when merchandising (as they compose their product lines), we explore the interactions between product assortment and return policy decisions of a firm under both make-to-order (MTO) and make-to-stock (MTS) environments. We show that the structure of the optimal assortment critically depends on the refund fraction and whether the products are supplied on an MTO or MTS basis.
