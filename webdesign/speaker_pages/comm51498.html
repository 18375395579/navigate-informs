Title: Characterizing Supply Chain Orchestration<br>Author: Pranab Majumder, Assistant Professor, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, Box 90120, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, majumder@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ashok Srinivasan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Using the network model of supply chains from Majumder and Srinivasan (2007), we present a characterization of the trade-offs involved in supply chain orchestration.  We illustrate that large network supply chains must be orchestrated in order to be efficient, since a reasonably featured model cannot be optimized using current supply chain contract knowledge.  However, we also show that orchestration is not guaranteed to make the supply chain more efficient.
