<br>Title: Product Line Design: Variety, Mass Customization and Economies of Scale</br><br>Author: Dennis Z. Yu, Assistant Professor, Clarkson University, School of Business, PO Box 5790, Potsdam, NY, 13699-5790, United States, yuz@wustl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sergio Chayet, Panos Kouvelis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A manufacturer's product line design is studied when the production technology allows quality differentiation. Customers are heterogeneous in their valuation of product quality. The manufacturer faces a tradeoff between production capacity investment and holding cost of WIP due to the system congestion. The presence of economies of scale is characterized by the existence of the product variety limit. We derive the manufacturer's optimal strategies under both dedicated and flexible technologies.</br>
