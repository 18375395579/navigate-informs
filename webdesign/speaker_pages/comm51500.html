<br>Title: Dual Sourcing in Managing Supply Chain Disruptions</br><br>Author: Ping Su, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, SUNY at New Paltz, School of Business, 1 Hawk Dr, New Paltz, NY, 12561, United States of America, sup@newpaltz.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shuguang Liu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper focuses on a firm that uses dual sourcing in mitigating supply chain risks. We assume that the firm’s demand evolves over time. The firm adjusts its sourcing strategies optimally from two suppliers: one is costly and reliable, and the other is cheap and unreliable. The disruption that could happen to the cheap supplier follows a Poisson process. We develop optimal sourcing policies for the firm and explore the benefits of dual sourcing.</br>
