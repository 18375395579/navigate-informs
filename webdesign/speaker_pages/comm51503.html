Title: Calculating Contracts for Institutional Support That Benefit Both the Anesthesia Group and Hospital<br>Author: Franklin Dexter, Professor, University of Iowa, Dept. of Anesthesia, 6JCP, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, franklin-dexter@uiowa.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Institutional support to anesthesia groups for clinical care is ubiquitous in the USA. We show that alternatives to two types of agreements either increase profit for the hospital or anesthesia group at the expense of the other. These agreements create incentives whereby the hospital and anesthesia group both profit from increased operating room workload and more accurate specialty-specific staffing (i.e., operating room allocations).
