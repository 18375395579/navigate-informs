<br>Title: Robust Newsvendor Competition</br><br>Author: Houyuan Jiang, Dr, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, Ca, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, h.jiang@jbs.cam.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Serguei Netessine, Sergei Savin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We generalize the analysis of newsvendor competition to the setting in which the competitors only possess information about support of demand distribution. We analyze and compare several approaches relying on regret minimization or the worst-case criterion instead of minimizing the expected profit. We find the unique and closed-form Nash equilibrium under suitable assumptions. Numerical analysis indicates that the absolute regret minimization offers the most sensible alternative.</br>
