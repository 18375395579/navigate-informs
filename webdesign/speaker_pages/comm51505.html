Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, valbeniz@iese.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Felipe Caro</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a multi-period extension of the competitive newsvendor model of Lippman and McCardle (1997), to investigate the impact of fast replenishment capabilities on competition. For this purpose, we consider two asymmetric retailers that compete in terms of inventory, i.e., excess demand overflows to the competitor. We visualize this problem as the competition between a traditional retailer that makes-to-stock before the season starts versus a retailer that has a fast response to the market.</br>
