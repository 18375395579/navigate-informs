Title: Showrooming and the competition Between Store and Online Retailers<br>Author: Amit Mehra, Assistant Professor and ISB Research Fellow, Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, India, Amit_Mehra@isb.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Showrooming is free riding by customers who evaluate products at brick-and-mortar stores to pick their best fit product, but buy this product at a competing online retailer if that product is available at a lower price. We evaluate several strategies to contain the loss of profit for brick-and-mortar stores due to this customer behavior.
