Each segment has a preferred product as well as acceptable alternative products that result in a substitution cost. Our aim is to determine a product portfolio, substitution plan, and procurement plan in order to maximize profit. We develop a large-scale MILP formulation, show that the problem is NP-Hard, and propose a Lagrangian-relaxation-based algorithm for obtaining near optimal solutions.</br>
