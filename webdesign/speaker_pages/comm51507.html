Title: Product Portfolio Design with Product Substitutions in an Assemble-to-Order System<br>Author: Zehra Melis Teksan, University of Florida, ISE Dept. 303 Weil Hall, P.O.

Each segment has a preferred product as well as acceptable alternative products that result in a substitution cost. Our aim is to determine a product portfolio, substitution plan, and procurement plan in order to maximize profit. We develop a large-scale MILP formulation, show that the problem is NP-Hard, and propose a Lagrangian-relaxation-based algorithm for obtaining near optimal solutions.
