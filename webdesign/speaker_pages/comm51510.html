These produts are partially complementary. Facing multiple uncertain demand streams, each manufacturer chooses a production quantity to maximize its own expected profit. The manufacturers' equilibrium solutions are studied. Managerial insights are drawn as to how system parameters and control mechanisms affect firms¡¯ decisions and performance.</br>
