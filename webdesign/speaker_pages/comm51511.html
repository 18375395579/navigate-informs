College Road, Wilmington, NC, 28403, United States of America, lorraine_lee@moore.sc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Kettinger, Rajiv Kohli<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Increasing competition is requiring hospitals to increase IT investments and offer differentiated services while also controlling costs.  We identify three strategic groupings of U.S. hospitals based on cost leadership and differentiation and test a proposition that a combinational strategy rather than strategically striving for two extremes will have the strongest impact of IT investment intensity on hospital performance.
