Title: A Behavioral Perspective of Strategic Interactions in Revenue Management Markets<br>Author: Srinivas Krishnamoorthy, University of Western Ontario, 1151 Richmond Street N, Room 2R14A, London, ON, N6A 3K7, Canada, skrishnamoorthy@ivey.uwo.ca<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Aggregate pricing decisions of travel capacity providers often appear to be economically irrational. A typical example is a price war between competing airlines or the special deals offered by competing hotels. Standard game theoretic models fail to explain these decisions. We use behavioral game theory to obtain more realistic predictions of provider behavior in competitive revenue management markets.
