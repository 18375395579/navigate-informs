<br>Title: The Optimal Disposition Decision for Product Returns</br><br>Author: Gilvan Souza, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, gsouza@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Luk N. Van Wassenhove, Evrim Didem Gunes, V. Daniel R. Guide, Jr.</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We model the optimal disposition decision for consumer returns: remanufacturing versus recycling.  High congestion in the remanufacturing facility delays the product sale at the secondary market, making recycling more attractive. We show that the optimal policy is: if remanufacturing time is larger than k*, then the product is recycled; otherwise it is remanufactured. Our policy provides a 25% median profit improvement compared to a policy that ignores the time value of money.</br>
