Title: Generalized Quantity Competition for Multiple Products and Loss of Efficiency<br>Author: Georgia Perakis, MIT, E53-359, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, georgiap@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Kluberg<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study quantity competition in oligopoly markets in order to understand when firms produce multiple products under a variety of constraints (i.e., capacity constraints), how bad the total profit and welfare in the market can become. We derive bounds that are independent of the constraints but rather depend on the number of firms, their market power and number of products.
