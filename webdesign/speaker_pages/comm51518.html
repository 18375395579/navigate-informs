The firms are symmetric differing only by their production capacity. We consider both the decentralized Nash equilibrium game and a centrally controlled setting. We study the capacity effects on the firms, compare prices, production levels, profits and loss of efficiency between the firms in the two settings. We design a contract for capacity level decision making.</br>
