Title: Role of Capacity in a Joint Inventory Management and Pricing Game<br>Author: Elodie Adida, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Chicago, MIE Department (MC 251) 3025 ERF, 842 W. Taylor St., Chicago, IL, 60607, United States of America, elodie@uic.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a demand-based pricing and production model where two firms compete over a differentiated substitutable product. The firms are symmetric differing only by their production capacity. We consider both the decentralized Nash equilibrium game and a centrally controlled setting. We study the capacity effects on the firms, compare prices, production levels, profits and loss of efficiency between the firms in the two settings. We design a contract for capacity level decision making.
