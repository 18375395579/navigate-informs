We consider a global firm who sells as a monopolist in the domestic market, and also sells to a foreign market facing competition there from a local incumbent. We compare the effects of three operational strategies of the global firm: with no operational flexibility, with postponement flexibility, and with both postponement and allocation flexibility.</br>
