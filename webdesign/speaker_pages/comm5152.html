The demand for online videos may be influencd by online WOM, social influence, the provider’s reputation, and competition. Our paper disentangles the influence of these factors. We model a viewer’s decision as first choosing categories and then videos within the categories. The hierarchical model allows videos within a category to have correlated demand.</br>
