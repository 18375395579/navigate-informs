<br>Title: Mitigate Supply Interruption Risk by Sharing Information and Using Coordinating Contract</br><br>Author: Zhaolin Li, Assistant Professor, City University of Hong Kong, P7620, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - ROC, zherli@cityu.edu.hk</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a one-supplier-one-retailer inventory system with random supply interruption, fixed upstream setup cost, lost sales, and stochastic demand. We show that the optimal policy for the retailer is a (s,S) policy. We propose a coordinating contract that coordinates the system (the retailer's optimal (s,S) policy is the same as the system optimum). We then perform a sensitivity analysis on contract parameters to see how various cost parameters may affect the channel performance.</br>
