The PSP can exert costly effort to identify promising suppliers; however, such effort is often difficult for the buyer to include in her contract. Using a game-theoretic model, we find the buyer's optimal strategy that minimizes her total expected costs. We test test our theoretic findings in laboratory.</br>
