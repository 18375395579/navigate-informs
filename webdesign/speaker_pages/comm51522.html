We characterize the solution in a multi-period stochastic setting, where in each period the organization must decide what fraction of its resources to allocate to 'mission-customers' vs. to 'revenue-customers'. We consider the interaction of operational and financial decisions by allowing for banking and for dynamic pricing. We compare the optimal policy with proportional allocation.</br>
