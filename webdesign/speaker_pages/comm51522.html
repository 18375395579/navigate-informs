Title: Resource and Revenue Management in Nonprofit Operations<br>Author: Miguel Lobo, Assistant Professor, Duke University, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, mlobo@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Francis de Véricourt<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We describe a two-customer-class model for nonprofit organizations that also engage in for-profit activities. We characterize the solution in a multi-period stochastic setting, where in each period the organization must decide what fraction of its resources to allocate to 'mission-customers' vs. to 'revenue-customers'. We consider the interaction of operational and financial decisions by allowing for banking and for dynamic pricing. We compare the optimal policy with proportional allocation.
