The model captures the Cournot competition among the manufacturers where the consumers differentiate among the products of firms, and the firms take into consideration the discarding costs of perished / wasted products. We investigate the complex challenge faced by the pharmaceutical industry, where an expensive brand  loses its dominant market share as a consequence of patent rights expiration.
