<br>Title: Uniform Pricing for Digital Goods: Effects on Competition</br><br>Author: Dinah Vernik, PhD Candidate, Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, dav2@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Preyas Desai, Debu Purohit</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The digitization of goods such as music and movies has led to the emergence of a new class of retailers that specialize in digital downloads. The resulting competition has led to interesting pricing policies. Online retailers tend to prefer uniform pricing where all products carry a single price, while traditional retailers differentiate prices. In our paper we show how the asymmetric equilibrium we observe in the market can change with the nature of competition between the retailers.</br>
