Title: Integrating Time-to-market, Pricing and Production Decisions<br>Author: Ozalp Ozer, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, oozer@stanford.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the time-to-market and subsequent pricing and production decisions for a firm that faces three major uncertainties: product qualification outcome, competitor behavior and demand.  We will characterize an optimal market timing, production and pricing policy. We will also discuss the impact of market environment and operating conditions on the firm's decisions and the resulting profit.
