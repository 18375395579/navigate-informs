Title: Supply Uncertainty and the Reverse Bullwhip Effect<br>Author: Lawrence Snyder, Assistant Professor, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, larry.snyder@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zuo-Jun Max Shen, Ying Rong<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present theoretical and empirical evidence for a reverse bullwhip effect (RBWE) that occurs in a variety of situations involving supply uncertainty.  In the RBWE, order volatility increases as one moves downstream in the supply chain.  This is the opposite of the classical bullwhip effect, which is generally associated with demand uncertainty.  We examine causes of RBWE, discuss its impact, and suggest strategies for mitigating it.
