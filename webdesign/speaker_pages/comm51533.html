We find that the value of sustainability audits need not increase as the pool of suppliers becomes less sustainable. Furthermore, even with ex ante symmetric suppliers, the current industry practice of blanket auditing the entire supply pool can be improved on by auditing only a subset of suppliers. Our insights also inform generic quality assessment policies.</br>
