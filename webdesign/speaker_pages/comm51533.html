Title: Procurement Auctions with Sustainability Audits<br>Author: Karca Aral, PhD Candidate, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77300, France, karca.aral@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Damian Beil, Luk Van Wassenhove<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the supplier auditing and selection process in the presence of unsustainability costs within a procurement auction framework. We find that the value of sustainability audits need not increase as the pool of suppliers becomes less sustainable. Furthermore, even with ex ante symmetric suppliers, the current industry practice of blanket auditing the entire supply pool can be improved on by auditing only a subset of suppliers. Our insights also inform generic quality assessment policies.
