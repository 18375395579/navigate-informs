<br>Title: Hotel Price Cache</br><br>Author: Wassim Chaar, Sr. Principal, Sabre Holdings, 3150 Sabre Drive, MD 8203, Southlake, TX, 76092, United States, wassim.chaar@sabre-holdings.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Hotel shopping uses cached rates in order to make the process efficient. The cache is charged each night by polling hotel CRSs for many combinations of future arrival and departure dates. When a property is selected, the actual rate is then retrieved from the hotel. Discrepancies between the cache and actual prices can lead to price jumps. This talk discusses the observed consumer choice behavior when a price jump occurs and measure its impact on revenue.</br>
