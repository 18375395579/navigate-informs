Title: Designing Reputation Systems<br>Author: Christina Aperjis, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Center, Room 391, Stanford, CA, United States, caperjis@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ramesh Johari<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In online marketplaces buyers often interact with sellers with whom they have never interacted before. A potential buyer has to decide whether to buy an item and how much to pay for it without being able to observe it and without knowing whether the seller is trustworthy. Reputation systems promote trust by giving information about past transactions. We study how a reputation system affects the seller's decisions and compare various reputation systems in terms of efficiency.
