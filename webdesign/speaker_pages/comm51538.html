Using a deterministic relaxation we characterize the optimal (price, delay) menu, and derive a condition in terms of demand elasticities under which service differentiation is optimal. We propose a set of prices, a priority rule, and a strategic delay control policy that is incentive compatible and asymptotically optimal in large systems, and discuss its properties</br>
