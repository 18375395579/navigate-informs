<br>Title: Contracting and Outsourcing in Collaborative Services</br><br>Author: Guillaume Roels, Assistant Professor, UCLA, UCLA Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza Gold Hall Suite B511, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States of America, guillaume.roels@anderson.ucla.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Uday Karmarkar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we evaluate the performance of various types of contract (fixed fee, time and materials, performance incentives) for collaborative services. We adopt a game-theoretic approach to model the joint interaction between a buyer and a vendor and services. Our model generates insights into how ex-ante specification, increased visibility on effort, and task allocation can be optimized to increase value in collaborative services.</br>
