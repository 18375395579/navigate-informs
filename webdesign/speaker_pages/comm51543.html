Title: Strategic Customer Behavior, Commitment, and Supply Chain Performance<br>Author: Xuanming Su, Assistant Professor, University of California, Haas School of Business, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, xuanming@haas.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fuqiang Zhang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consider a newsvendor facing strategic customers who expect that prices may fall after random demand is realized. In this setting, we derive the optimal pricing and inventory decisions. We then study decentralized supply chains facing strategic customers, and show that contractual mechanisms can serve as commitment devices to improve supply chain performance. Surprisingly, we find that decentralized systems may outperform the centralized benchmark, even under a simple wholesale price contract.
