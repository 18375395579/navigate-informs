In this setting, we derive the optimal pricing and inventory decisions. We then study decentralized supply chains facing strategic customers, and show that contractual mechanisms can serve as commitment devices to improve supply chain performance. Surprisingly, we find that decentralized systems may outperform the centralized benchmark, even under a simple wholesale price contract.</br>
