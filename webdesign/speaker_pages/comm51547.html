The seller has to deal with a customized package without any sales history. A top-down and bottom-up approach is applied to estimate the demand elasticity from the historical sales data for various configurations. We establish a utility model to characterize each package and calculate the dependency among the commodities. The business impact is justified based on the price optimization.</br>
