Title: New Approach to Pricing Personalized Product Bundles with Multi-Commodity Configurations<br>Author: Zizhuo Wang, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, zwang@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Markus Ettl, Zhengliang Xue<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a method to price personalized packages of multiple commodities, e.g. hardware, software and service. The seller has to deal with a customized package without any sales history. A top-down and bottom-up approach is applied to estimate the demand elasticity from the historical sales data for various configurations. We establish a utility model to characterize each package and calculate the dependency among the commodities. The business impact is justified based on the price optimization.
