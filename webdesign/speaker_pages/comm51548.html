Title: Cognition and Heterogeneity in Multi-Echelon Supply Chains<br>Author: Brent Moritz, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University, 469 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, bmoritz@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chalam Narayanan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Supply chain performance often depends on the decisions of individual channel members. Using a supply chain simulation, we find that the cogntive profile of the decision maker impacts performance, and this results holds under standard mitigation strategies. The findings have implications for supply chain and design of decision support structures.
