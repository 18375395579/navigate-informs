<br>Title: The KAPSARC Energy Model (Saudi Arabia)</br><br>Author: Frederic H. Murphy, Professor, Temple University and KAPSARC, Broad and Montgomery, Philadelphia, PA, 19122, United States of America, fmurphy@temple.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bertrand Rioux, Axel Pierru, Walid Matar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This MCP model, built initially to analyze domestic Saudi Arabian energy policies including the management of subsidies, provides an integrated view demonstrating the benefits of coordinating investments among key players in the economy. We examine planning for electricity, water, refined products, and petrochemicals in a context of administered prices. The model is a template for capturing the consequences of policymakers determining prices and quantity allocations in commodity markets.</br>
