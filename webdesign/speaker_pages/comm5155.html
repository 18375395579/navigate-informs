<br>Title: Multi-period Price Optimization for Grocery Retailers</br><br>Author: Maxime Cohen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, maxcohen@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kiran Panchamgam, Georgia Perakis, Zachary Leung, Andrew Vakhutinsky</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Product line pricing is an important business problem faced by retailers. We formulate a time-dependent price optimization problem for merchandise items in a product category, where demand for each item is a nonlinear function of all the prices. We require the prices to lie in a given price ladder and to satisfy business requirements such as sales target, inter-item constraints and store image preservation. We illustrate that the problem is hard and propose and compare various solution methods.</br>
