Title: Adapting to a Shock: Optimal Sequential Market-making<br>Author: Sanmay Das, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Department of Computer Science, 110 8th St, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, sanmay@cs.rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Malik Magdon-Ismail<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a dynamic-programming approach to optimal sequential price-setting in a stylized model of dealer markets. Our algorithm reveals a surprising insight: an optimal monopolist can provide more liquidity to the market in periods of high uncertainty, because she is willing to absorb initial losses to learn valuations more quickly.
