Title: Evaluating the Performance of Multi-Stage Supply Chains Under Disruptions and Random Customer Demand<br>Author: Sanjay Kumar, PhD Student, University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, PO Box 830688, SM30, Richardson, TX, 75083, United States, skumar@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fred Glover, Kathryn Stecke, Thomas Schmitt<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Uncertain demand and periodic disruptions pose critically important challenges to effective supply chain management. We test the performance of such supply chains under various scenarios relating to costs, expediting, and length of disruptions. The study also employs search routines to find order-up-to quantities that minimize total supply chain costs.
