We propose a performance measure for the evaluation of supply chain vulnerability. The model investigate the interplay of the heterogeneous decision-makers in the supply chain and compute the equilibrium pattern of product transactions, prices, and levels of social relationship.  The results show that high levels of relationship lead to lower overall cost, lower price and higher product transaction.
