The firm can build in-house capacity and also avail of outsourcing via an option contract. The optimal policy is characterized by 2 base-capacity levels in a 3-period problem. A general problem is discussed in a numerical study. Partial outsourcing is indeed optimal in most cases and is critical right after product launch and near patent expiration.
