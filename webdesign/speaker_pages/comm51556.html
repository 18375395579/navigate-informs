<br>Title: Pharmaceutical Capacity Planning: Partial Outsourcing and Heterogeneous Capacities</br><br>Author: Hiroko Okajima, Ph.D. Candidate, Smeal College of Business, Penn State University, 467 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, huo104@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Zhao, Susan Xu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by industry examples, we study drugmaker's partial outsourcing/capacity expansion strategies during a drug's patent protected period. The firm can build in-house capacity and also avail of outsourcing via an option contract. The optimal policy is characterized by 2 base-capacity levels in a 3-period problem. A general problem is discussed in a numerical study. Partial outsourcing is indeed optimal in most cases and is critical right after product launch and near patent expiration.</br>
