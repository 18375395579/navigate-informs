Vijay Krishna<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine a continuous time investment decision in multiple prospects of uncertain type. Good types produce a one-time payoff (success) after a random amount of investment while bad types never produce a payoff and we learn about these types through investment. Moreover, success in a prospect increases the reward to be obtained from future successes so an index policy need not be optimal. We show that the optimal policy is a threshold policy and exhibits two distinct patterns of investment.
