<br>Title: Managing Investment in Risky Prospects with Complementarities</br><br>Author: Stefan Rampertshammer, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, 100 Fuqua Drive, Box 90120, Durham, NC, 27708-0120, United States of America, stefan.rampertshammer@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sasa Pekec, R. Vijay Krishna</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We examine a continuous time investment decision in multiple prospects of uncertain type. Good types produce a one-time payoff (success) after a random amount of investment while bad types never produce a payoff and we learn about these types through investment. Moreover, success in a prospect increases the reward to be obtained from future successes so an index policy need not be optimal. We show that the optimal policy is a threshold policy and exhibits two distinct patterns of investment.</br>
