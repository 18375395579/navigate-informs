Title: On the Marginal Value of Energy Storage in Selling Random Wind<br>Author: Eilyan Bitar, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, eyb5@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pramod Khargonekar, Kameshwar Poolla<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Wind is inherently random. In the following, we’ll explore the extent to which energy storage can be used to mitigate quantity risk for wind power producers offering forward contracts in a two-settlement electricity market. In particular, we derive analytical expressions relating explicitly the marginal value of energy storage capacity to the spectral properties of the underlying wind power process.
