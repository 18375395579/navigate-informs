Title: Product Upgrade Strategies: Is Technology a Threat or a Competitive Opportunity?<br>Author: Sam Kirshner, Queen's University, 143 Union Street, Kingston, ON, Canada, skirshner@business.queensu.ca<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Product upgrade strategies have a significant impact on a firm’s profits, particularly in industries characterized by high R&D investment costs and an evolving technological frontier. To understand the impact of competitive pressures, we model the optimal size and timing of a firm’s upgrade when consumers are influenced by the latest innovation. The model is used to analyze whether technology is an opportunity, helping to increase profits, or a threat, which forces the firm out of the market.
