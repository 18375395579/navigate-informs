Two modeling approaches are presented for the price-setting behavior. The paper identifies how these decisions change with backlogging and lost sales independently, and later with the yield-dependent purchasing cost. The results are generalized by considering: 1) linear and iso-elastic demand functions, and 2) additive and multiplicative forms of supply and demand uncertainty.</br>
