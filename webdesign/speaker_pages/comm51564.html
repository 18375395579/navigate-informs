Title: Sharing Product Take-Back Responsibility Across the Supply Chain<br>Author: Brian Jacobs, Doctoral Student, College of Management, Georgia Tech, 800 West Peachtree Street NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, brian.jacobs@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ravi Subramanian<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) typically holds producers - the last link in the value-adding chain - responsible for the environmental impacts of end-of-life products. Using a two-echelon model, we demonstrate how the sharing of EPR program costs between the echelons moves a decentralized supply chain closer to the coordinated benchmark.
