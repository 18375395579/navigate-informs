Title: The Benefit/Detriment of Information in Coordinating Supply Chains<br>Author: Michael Wagner, St Mary's College of CA, 380 Moraga Rd, Moraga, CA, United States of America, mrw2@stmarys-ca.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a simple supply chain with a supplier and retailer, where one player knows the probabilistic distribution of demand and the other only knows the mean and variance. We show that this informational asymmetry either reduces or exacerbates the double marginalization effect. We study how the direction of asymmetry, level of uncertainty, economics and game theoretic considerations affect supply chain, as well as individual firm, performance.
