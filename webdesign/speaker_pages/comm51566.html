Title: Optimizing Product Launches in the Presence of Strategic Consumers<br>Author: Jigar Patel, New York University, 44 West 4th Street, KMC 8-152, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, jigar@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ilan Lobel, Gustavo Vulcano, Jiawei Zhang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of a technology firm deciding the optimal timing of its product launches. Consumers are strategic and weigh the value of purchasing improved products in light of future technological improvements. We completely characterize the optimal launch policies for two cases: one where the firm pre-announces the product launch times in the market, and the second where no information about the future launches is divulged. Revenue gap between both cases can be very significant.
