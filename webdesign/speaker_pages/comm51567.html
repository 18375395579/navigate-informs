Title: Honesty as an Optimal Policy under Bounded Rationality<br>Author: He Chen, R.H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, United States of America, hechen@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Manu Goyal, Krishnan S. Anand<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Incomplete contracts are vulnerable to opportunism. In a multi-period relationship with incomplete contracts between a boundedly-rational manufacturer and his supplier, we prove that an ‘honest?manufacturer can outperform a quintessential ‘opportunistic?manufacturer, even though the opportunistic manufacturer can mimic the honest manufacturer. Thus, honesty emerges endogenously as an optimal policy.
