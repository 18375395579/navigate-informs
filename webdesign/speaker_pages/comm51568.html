Title: Bargaining for Supply Chain Revenue Allocation<br>Author: Dror Hermel, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel, Dror.Hermel@sauder.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Granot, Mahesh Nagarajan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We present a negotiation model to arrive at profit sharing in a supply chain with a pivotal agent who interacts with N non-pivotal agents, which may or may not communicate among themselves.  We arrive at an allocation, using NBS and an endogenously generated disagreement outcome. For non-communicating settings it constitutes a Nash-Nash equilibrium.  For a communicating setting our allocation, surprisingly, equals the Shapley value of a related cooperative game.
