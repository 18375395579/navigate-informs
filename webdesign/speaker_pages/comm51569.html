Title: Beyond Strategic Alliances: The Role of  Informal Collaborations in the Biotechnology Industry<br>Author: Paul Almeida, Associate Professor of Strategy & International Business Academic Director, Global Executive MBA Dean's Faculty Fellow McDonough School of Business Georgetown University, Washington, DC, 20057, almeidap@georgetown.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Research in strategic management has shown that strategic alliances facilitate inter-firm learning and innovation. Previous research has paid less attention to individual collaborations across firms and the associated benefits to firm innovativeness. Our paper investigates the role and impact of individual research collaborations, as evidenced by co-authorship of publications by biotechnology scientists, on the patented innovative output of the firm. We find that while strategic alliances are formed primarily with other firms, individual collaborations are usually formed with university scientists. The total number of individual collaborations aggregated at the firm level positively impacts the patenting output of biotechnology firms, but this effect decreases with firm age and size. Our findings reveal that firms are most innovative when they rely primarily on one form of collaborative activity - the highest levels of firm innovativeness are, in fact, achieved for high levels of individual collaborations and low levels of strategic alliances.
