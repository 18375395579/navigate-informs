<br>Title: Rational Market Making with Probabilistic Knowledge</br><br>Author: Abe Othman, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, aothman@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tuomas Sandholm</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a market maker (MM) that has a prior over future world states and of how the price of a bet affects the probability that traders will accept it. Computing the optimal policy for a risk-neutral MM is simple, but challenging for a Kelly criterion MM. The former does not depend on the MM’s state, while the latter depends intricately on time and state. Counterintuitively, the latter may offer bets that are myopically irrational with respect to her beliefs for the entire trading period.</br>
