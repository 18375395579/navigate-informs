Title: Dynamic LMP Response under Alternative Price-cap and Price-sensitive Demand Scenarios<br>Author: Junjie Sun, Financial Economist, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 250 E Street SW, MS 2-1, Washington, DC, 20219, United States of America, junjiesun@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Leigh Tesfatsion, Hongyan Li<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This study investigates the complicated nonlinear effects of demand-bid price sensitivity and supply-offer price caps on Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) for bulk electric power when profit-seeking generators can learn over time how to strategize their supply offers. Systematic computational experiments are conducted using AMES, an open-source agent-based test bed developed by the authors, to model a dynamic restructured wholesale power market operating on an AC transmission grid.
