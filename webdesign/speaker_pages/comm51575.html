Title: Strategic Information Management Under Leakage in a Supply Chain<br>Author: Manu Goyal, mgoyal@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Krishnan Anand<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In practical settings, material and information flows are intertwined, calling for their joint optimization to maximize channel efficiency. We analyze one such setting where material and information flows intersect through the mechanism of information leakage (non-consensual sharing of information), and study its effect on the joint determination of material flows (the order quantities) and information flows (acquisition and dissemination of demand information) in a vertical contract.
