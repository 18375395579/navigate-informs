<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing of Peak Generation in Electricity Markets</br><br>Author: Heikki Peura, PhD Student, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, hpeura.phd2010@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Derek Bunn</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: With reference to electricity, we study the problem of pricing peak production of an instantly perishable product in a dynamic setting with market power. In a repeated game with future demand uncertainty, peak producers' profitability may hinge on their ability to implicitly collude on prices. Furthermore, diversification in generation technologies as well as financial constraints in the form of revenue targets may have significant impacts on peak producers?pricing decisions.</br>
