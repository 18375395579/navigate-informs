However, reducing the time-to-market typically requires higher development costs that may offset any first-mover advantage. In this paper, we analyze this trade-off problem in a competitive duopoly market from the perspective of a risk neutral firm that wants to maximize the project’s expected total profit.  We consider different payoff structures, as well as static and dynamic project scheduling policies.</br>
