Title: Supply Chain Coordination and Influenza Vaccination (Submitted for the 2006 Pierskalla Award)<br>Author: Hamed Mamani, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Building E40-130, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, hamed@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi, Stephen Chick<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Billions of dollars are being allocated for influenza pandemic preparedness. Vaccination is a primary weapon for fighting influenza outbreaks. Differences that distinguish the influenza vaccine supply chain from the typical supply chains include a nonlinear value of sales and vaccine production yield issues. We show that production risks, taken by the manufacturer, lead to an insufficient supply of vaccine and design a variant of the cost sharing contract that can coordinate the supply chain.
