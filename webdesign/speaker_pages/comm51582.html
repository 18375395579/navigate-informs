Title: Mechanism Design Approach to Electricity Markets<br>Author: Luciano De Castro, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridon Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, l-decastro@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The standard framework to electricity markets is that of competitive markets, somehow adjusted to take in account eventual market power. In this framework, electric energy is just a homogenous good, to be negotiated in a spot market. Although contracts could be written for future delivery, this is just a consequence of the risk aversion of the players, since price variance can be significant. We propose a different way of looking at electricity markets: one given by mechanism design.
