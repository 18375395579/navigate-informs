In this framework, electric energy is just a homogenous good, to be negotiated in a spot market. Although contracts could be written for future delivery, this is just a consequence of the risk aversion of the players, since price variance can be significant. We propose a different way of looking at electricity markets: one given by mechanism design.</br>
