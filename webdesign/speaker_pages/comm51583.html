Retailers place orders for immediate delivery or place orders in advance of their needs, thereby accepting a particular demand lead time. We determine an optimal menu of demand lead times and corresponding payments that maximize the manufacturer's profit. We explore the impact of design issues, such as postponement, on optimal contract parameters.</br>
