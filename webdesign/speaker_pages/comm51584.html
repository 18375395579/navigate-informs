Johnny Rungtusanatham</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Extant research suggests that buying firms simultaneously adopt multiple risk mitigation tactics to minimize the threat of supply disruption.  In this study, we investigate buyers?simultaneous use of inventory positioning, contingency planning, and relationship management tactics and develop a taxonomy of risk mitigation strategies.  Further, we examine how buyers?demographics, product attributes, supply market factors, and perceptions of supply risk vary across risk mitigation strategies.</br>
