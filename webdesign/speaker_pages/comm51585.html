Title: Supplier Competition in Retail Supply Chains<br>Author: Gurhan Kok, Associate Professor, Duke University, One Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, United States of America, gurhan.kok@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gerard Cachon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We analyze the competition between two manufacturers selling a product each through a common retailer. As a best response, a manufacturer can always increase its profit by offering a quantity discount contract.  The equilibrium solution with quantity discount contracts, however, may lead to lower profits for the manufacturers and higher retailer profit, relative to the equilibrium with wholesale price contracts.
