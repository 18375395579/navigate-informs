We show that, when competing downstream retailers invest in private forecasts, common contracting schemes fail to coordinate the supply chain and cause overinvestment, as well as large supply chain inefficiencies. We analyze uniform price supply auctions as a remedy. We study the optimal design and characteristics of such auctions, and demonstrate that their utilization can achieve supply chain efficiency.</br>
