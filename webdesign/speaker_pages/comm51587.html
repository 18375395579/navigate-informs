Title: Utilization of Uniform Price Auctions in Supply Chain Coordination with Forecast Investment<br>Author: Tunay Tunca, Professor, Stanford University, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, tunca_tunay@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyoduk Shin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study supply chain coordination with investment in demand forecasting. We show that, when competing downstream retailers invest in private forecasts, common contracting schemes fail to coordinate the supply chain and cause overinvestment, as well as large supply chain inefficiencies. We analyze uniform price supply auctions as a remedy. We study the optimal design and characteristics of such auctions, and demonstrate that their utilization can achieve supply chain efficiency.
