Title: Inventory Management Under Market Size Dynamics<br>Author: Rod Parker, Assistant Professor, Yale School of Management, PO Box 208200, New Haven, CT, 06520-8200, United States, rodney.parker@yale.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tava Olsen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We investigate the situation where a customer experiencing an inventory stockout at a retailer potentially leaves the firm's market.  In classical inventory theory a unit stockout penalty cost has been used as a surrogate to mimic the economic effect of such a departure; in this study we explicitly represent this aspect of consumer behavior, incorporating the diminishing effect of the consumers leaving the market upon the stochastic demand distribution in a time-dynamic context.
