Title: Effect of Term Structure Model of Futures Price on Procurement Policies<br>Author: Ankur Goel, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Cleveland, United States of America, axg312@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Genaro Gutierrez<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We estimate the futures price of a contract whose maturity does not coincide with the maturity of the traded contracts  on the commodity exchange. We propose Kalman filter based price models and regression analysis to predict the futures price. We show that statistically sophisticated Kalman filter price model are not always superior to the simple regression analysis. We develop procurement policies for a commodity processor and test them on out-of-sample futures price data.
