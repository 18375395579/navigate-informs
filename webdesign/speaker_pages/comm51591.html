Title: Choice Modeling vs. Price Optimization for Revenue Management<br>Author: Pelin Pekgun, Assistant Professor, University of South Carolina, Moore School of Business, Columbia, SC, 29205, United States of America, pelin.pekgun@moore.sc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Ferguson<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Traditional revenue management methods, based on inventory controls that assume independence between the customer classes, are no longer effective in an environment where prices and product offerings are highly transparent. Two approaches that have been proposed to address this include discrete choice modeling approaches and price sensitive demand models with price optimization. In this talk, we present the recent work in this area, and discuss the pros and cons of each approach.
