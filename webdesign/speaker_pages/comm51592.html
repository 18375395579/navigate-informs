Title: Collaboration in Contingent Capacities with Information Asymmetry<br>Author: Jun Zhang, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, Richardson, TX, United States, jun.zhang@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Amiya Chakravarty<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the optimal contracting problem between two firms collaborating on capacity investment with information asymmetry. Our analysis shows that system efficiency can always be improved by the optimal contract and the improvement in system efficiency is due to two factors. While the optimal contract may bring the system's capacity level closer to the first-best capacity level, it prevents the higher-margin firm from overinvesting and aligns the capacity-investment decisions of the two firms.
