A firm sets capacity levels and number, design quality levels, and prices for vertically differentiated product offerings.  Customers have heterogeneous quality valuations. We use  queuing systems to model production processes.   We characterize the optimal  decisions for non-flexible and a continuum of different types of flexible production systems and discuss key variety drivers.</br>
