<br>Title: Role of Quality Investment in Entry Deterrence</br><br>Author: Feryal Erhun, Stanford University, Department of MS&E, Stanford, CA, United States of America, ferhun@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozgen Karaer</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study a monopolist’s pricing and quality strategies to blockade, deter or accommodate an entrant when entry is in fact avoidable. We also consider the scenario that entry is bound to happen and find the impact of timing and collaboration in the duopoly market. Our model can describe particular platform product markets and hence explain some pricing trends, such as harsh pricing competition, that are observed between the Xbox and Playstation video game consoles.</br>
