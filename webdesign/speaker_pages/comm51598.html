<br>Title: Incentive Contracts Under Asymmetric Information: Extension to General Project Networks</br><br>Author: Murat Bayiz, University of Southern California, murat.bayiz@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Charles Corbett</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a set-up where a project manager interacts with multiple subcontractors who work on different tasks of a project. The project manager sets incentives to motivate subcontractors to work harder on their tasks. We study such incentives contracts and compare them with fixed price contracts under general project networks. We also investigate effects of information asymmetry and project network structure on contracting decisions.</br>
