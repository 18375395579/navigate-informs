The manufacturer produces a single product and sells it through the retailer.  The extended warranty could, however, be offered by either party.  We use game theoretic models to answer the following questions. What are the characteristics of optimal extended warranty policy decisions? Which scenario leads to a higher total supply chain profit, a retailer offering the extended warranty or the manufacturer?
