We consider transfer pricing as an income shifting tool that allows to benefit from tax differential and that also serves as an incentive tool within the firm. We show that the optimal offshoring policy for a centralized firm has an all-or-nothing structure. Under information asymmetry, the firm benefits from decentralizing pricing or offshoring decisions, in which case the policy changes to partial offshoring.</br>
