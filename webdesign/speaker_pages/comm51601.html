Hausman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the impact of the buyer's financial health concerns of suppliers on his supplier selection. We formulate a mathematical model where multiple suppliers compete for a divisible supply across multiple periods. Inclusion of the buyer's financial health concerns reveals dynamics that have been overlooked in the previous literatures on supplier selection and supply risk.</br>
