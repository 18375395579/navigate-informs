Title: The Role of Financial Services in Procurement Contracts<br>Author: Xiang-Feng Chen, Fudan University, 220, Handan Rd., Shanghai, 200433, China, xchen@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rene Caldentey<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate the interplay between operations and financial decisions in the design of procurement contracts. A budget constrained retailer purchases a product from a supplier and afterwards sells it in a retail market to a random demand.  We compare two forms of financing for the retailer: ‘External Financing?in the form of a commercial loan and ‘Internal Financing?in which the supplier offers financial services to the retailer in the form of a specially tailored procurement contract.
