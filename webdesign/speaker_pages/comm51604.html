Ravi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We undertake an integrated study of inbound and outbound logistics at a leading automotive parts manufacturer. We identify the opportunity for significant cost savings over the current system by matching opposite flows of material and containers. We consider the problem from a supply chain coordination perspective, where the parts manufacturer makes all the transportation arrangements for its customers and suppliers based on the results of the centralized optimum solution.</br>
