Title: To Supply or Not to Supply to a Competing Buyer<br>Author: Zhibin (Ben) Yang, Assistant Professor, University of oregon, United States of America, zyang@uoregon.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haresh Gurnani, Xinxin Hu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the supplier's allocation of limited production capacity to a buyer that sells to the same market, using a three-stage model.  We characterize the buyer and the supplier's market competition equilibrium in which the buyer may strategically withhold excessive supply, and analyze the supplier's capacity allocation and pricing decisions.
