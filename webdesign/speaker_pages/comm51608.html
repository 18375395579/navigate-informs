<br>Title: Impact of Electricity Pricing Policy on the Investment of Renewable Energy</br><br>Author: Safak Yucel, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, United States of America, safak.yucel@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gurhan Kok, Kevin Shang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the effect of time-based pricing policies on renewable energy investment. We show that different pricing policies may lead to opposite effects on renewable energy investment of utilities, independent power producers (IPP) and the households. In contrast with the expectations of policy makers, we show that renewable energy investment of IPPs and utilities may be encouraged by flat pricing. We also investigate the effect of subsidies on carbon emissions and renewable energy investment.</br>
