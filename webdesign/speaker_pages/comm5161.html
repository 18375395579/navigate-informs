The supplier provides one product to the retailers, and each retailer faces iid end-customer demands. We want to identify the effect of price fluctuations and information sharing on the supply chain performance in terms of the total supply chain costs. We also want to determine the optimal magnitudes of the price fluctuations and schedule the price fluctuations across retailers to maximize the benefit.
