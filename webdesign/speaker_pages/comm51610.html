Title: Seeking Closure: Competition in Complementary Markets<br>Author: H. Sebastian Heese, Assistant Professor, Indiana University, Kelley School of Business, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States, hheese@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kyle Cattani<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Firms that compete in markets for complementary products must consider the interdependence across markets as well as the competition within markets. When does a strategy based on preclusion make sense, and when would firms be better off by accepting a common standard? We address these questions employing standard game theoretic analysis to a simple spatial model that captures aspects of both inter-market externalities and intra-market competition.
