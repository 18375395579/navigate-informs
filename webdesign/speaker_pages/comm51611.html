<br>Title: Product Positioning without Market Information</br><br>Author: Serkan Eren, PhD Student, Columbia Business School, 435 West 119th Stree Apt. 3F, New York, NY, 10027, United States, se2027@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin, Costis Maglaras</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Traditional pricing and product positioning models assume that firms have full information about the market demand and consumer preferences. In practice, however, one rarely has such accurate information, which raises the important question of how to make decisions under limited market information. We study five classical settings where the firm has limited information. Several results correspond to common policies observed in practice. This talk will concentrate on product positioning models.</br>
