Title: Bundled Procurement for (Free) Technology Acquisition and Future Competition<br>Author: Leon Chu, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, leonyzhu@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yunzeng Wang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the effectiveness of a procurement mechanism of a buyer that bundles the product procurement with the technology acquisition. It turns out that each supplier has a dominant offering strategy for the technology provision that only depends on the technology difference of the suppliers and the ratio between the current project size and the future market size. We find that a ratio of 10% is sufficient for the suppliers to offer the best technologies for most reasonable market conditions.
