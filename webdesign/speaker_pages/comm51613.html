<br>Title: Sharing Responsibility for Product Take-Back Across the Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Brian Jacobs, Georgia Tech, 800 W. Peachtree NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, brian.jacobs@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ravi Subramanian</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We use a two-echelon model to determine the impacts of EPR collection and recycling mandates on profits for integrated and decentralized supply chains.  We demonstrate how the sharing of EPR program costs between the echelons can move a decentralized chain closer to the coordinated profit benchmark. We propose a social welfare construct that considers consumer surplus, supply chain profits, and environmental externalities to aid the social planner in assessing the effectiveness of EPR programs.</br>
