<br>Title: Coping with Gray Market: The Impact of Market Conditions and Product Characteristics</br><br>Author: Foad Iravani, Assistant Professor, Foster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98004, United States of America, firavani@uw.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Reza Ahmadi, Hamed Mamani</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the impact of gray markets on a price-setting manufacturer with uncertain demand. Furthermore, we explore the impact of market conditions and product characteristics on the manufacturer's policy towards parallel importation. We also provide managerial insights about the value of strategic decision-making by comparing the optimal policy to the uniform pricing policy that has been adopted by some companies to eliminate gray markets entirely.</br>
