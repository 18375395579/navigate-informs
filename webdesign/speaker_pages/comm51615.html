Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the innovator prefers to limit its own actions by granting launch control rights or buy-out options to the marketer. We show that the nature of the effect of R&D effort has a major influence on optimal contract structure. Our results demonstrate that allocation of control rights can have a significant influence on success, quality and profitability.</br>
