Title: Licensing Contracts: Control Rights and Options<br>Author: Niyazi Taneri, Singapore Univ. of Technology and Design, 20 Dover Drive, Singapore, Singapore, niyazitaneri@sutd.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Pascale Crama, Bert De Reyck<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate how contract structure - payment terms and control rights - influence R&D collaborations. Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the innovator prefers to limit its own actions by granting launch control rights or buy-out options to the marketer. We show that the nature of the effect of R&D effort has a major influence on optimal contract structure. Our results demonstrate that allocation of control rights can have a significant influence on success, quality and profitability.
