Title: Time Period Unbundling and the Transformation of Auctions<br>Author: Richard Steinberg, Reader in Operations Management, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, r.steinberg@jbs.cam.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Dolores Romero Morales<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Consider a firm that satisfies demand over a time period by assigning it to a supplier via the Vickrey auction (the standard auction). The firm is considering breaking demand into smaller time periods and permitting bids for one or more of these sub-periods, either as independent bids or as package bids, via the VCG mechanism (the unbundled auction).  One might expect the buyer’s cost to always be lower in the unbundled auction, but we show the cost can be higher and provide a bound.
