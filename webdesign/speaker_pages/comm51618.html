Title: The Impact of Special Ordering on Manufacturer-retailer Interactions<br>Author: Hao-Wei Chen, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, hwchen@ie.umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haresh Gurnani, Diwakar Gupta<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Many retailers offer to special order out-of-stock items at no additional cost to customers. Because special orders reduce stock outs, it is commonly believed that special ordering increases profits. We study the impact of customer participation rates and demand variability on the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s profits under special ordering.
