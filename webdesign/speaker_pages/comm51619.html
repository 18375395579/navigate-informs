<br>Title: Inefficient Diversification</br><br>Author: Kostas Bimpikis, Stanford University, 655 Knight Way, Knight Management Center, E-360, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, kostasb@gsb.stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We argue that in the presence of liquidation costs, portfolio diversification may be socially inefficient. In our model, banks have an incentive to hold diversified portfolios. Yet, diversification may increase the aggregate risk for the depositors creating a negative externality.  Systemic risk increases since even though diversification decreases the probability of each bank's failure, it may increase the probability of joint failures, which may be inefficient for risk-averse depositors.</br>
