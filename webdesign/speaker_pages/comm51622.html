Title: Hydrogen Production Facility Network Design from Stochastic Green Energy Supply Source<br>Author: Jorge Barnett Lawton, Zaragoza Logistics Center, C/ Bari 55, PLAZA, Edificio Nayade, Portal 5, Zaragoza, 50197, Spain, jbarnett@zlc.edu.es<br>Coauthor(s): Mozart Menezes, Jarrod Goentzel<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Hydrogen has been identified as a clean alternative to store energy from volatile sources. We analyze the production and distribution network design problem of a firm generating electricity from wind and producing hydrogen by electrolysis, in the presence of stochastic energy prices and supply. We provide solution approaches using column generation, and use our model to evaluate a future hydrogen supply chain in Spain, under different distribution policies and government incentive schemes.
