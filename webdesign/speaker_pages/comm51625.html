The product demand follows a Bass-type diffusion process and is determined by the market influences, retail price, and shelf-space allocated to it. We consider the myopic and far-sighted retailer profit strategies. We characterize the optimal dynamic shelf space allocation and optimal pricing policies. Surprisingly, the manufacturer, and even the retailer, may be better off with a myopic strategy.</br>
