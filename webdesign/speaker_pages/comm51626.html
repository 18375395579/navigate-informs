It has long been promoted as a green strategy, but critics contend that such strategies may not increase profits and could actually harm the environment. We research when servicization leads to a win-win situation for both the firm and the environment. We endogenize product durability and consumer use decisions and allow the servicizing firm to segment the market.</br>
