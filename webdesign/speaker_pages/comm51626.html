Title: Profitability and Environmental Implications of Servicization<br>Author: Vinayak Deshpande, Associate Professor, University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler School, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, Vinayak_Deshpande@kenan-flagler.unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Adem Orsdemir, Ali Parlakturk<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Servicization is a novel strategy which involves selling the functionality of a product or service, rather than a product itself. It has long been promoted as a green strategy, but critics contend that such strategies may not increase profits and could actually harm the environment. We research when servicization leads to a win-win situation for both the firm and the environment. We endogenize product durability and consumer use decisions and allow the servicizing firm to segment the market.
