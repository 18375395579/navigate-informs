Title: Deploying Test Auctions to Assist with Supplier Qualification Decision-Making<br>Author: Brendan See, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48104, United States of America, bdsee@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Damian Beil, Izak Duenyas<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Entrant suppliers must undergo a costly qualification process prior to competing in a procurement auction. We evaluate when a buyer can benefit from holding multiple auctions when the supply base consists of both qualified incumbents and not-yet-qualified entrant suppliers who can be qualified at a cost. The buyer faces a trade-off between increased supplier competition and revealing supplier cost information. We extend the model to incorporate a credible reserve price and TIOLI offer.
