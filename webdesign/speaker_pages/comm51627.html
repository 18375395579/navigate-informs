We evaluate when a buyer can benefit from holding multiple auctions when the supply base consists of both qualified incumbents and not-yet-qualified entrant suppliers who can be qualified at a cost. The buyer faces a trade-off between increased supplier competition and revealing supplier cost information. We extend the model to incorporate a credible reserve price and TIOLI offer.</br>
