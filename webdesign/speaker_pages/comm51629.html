Posted price mechanisms are a simple and quick alternative. In this work, we compare full-revelation mechanisms to posted-price mechanisms, both with symmetric and discriminatory prices.  We show that optimal discriminatory prices are nearly as good as full-revelation mechanisms, while a single posted price is asymptotically worse.</br>
