Title: Posted Prices vs. Negotiations: An Asymptotic Analysis<br>Author: Liad Blumrosen, Microsoft Research, 1065 La Avenida, Mountain View, CA, 94043, United States of America, liadbl@microsoft.com<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Holenstein<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A full bidding process may be infeasible or costly in some environments. Posted price mechanisms are a simple and quick alternative. In this work, we compare full-revelation mechanisms to posted-price mechanisms, both with symmetric and discriminatory prices.  We show that optimal discriminatory prices are nearly as good as full-revelation mechanisms, while a single posted price is asymptotically worse.
