Title: Capacity and Price Competition Under Imperfect Information<br>Author: Bing Jing, Assistant Professor of Marketing, Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, Oriental Plaza, 3F, Tower E3, 1 East Chang An Avenue, Beijing, 100738, China, bjing@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yuxin Chen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine capacity-then-price competition in a duopoly where some (the remaining) consumers are uninformed (informed) about prices. The central result is the following. Even in the absence of capacity costs, in the sub-game perfect equilibria each firm in general chooses a capacity below its maximum demand and thus has to undertake rationing when it prices below its competitor. The price equilibrium in the first stage is of independent interest.
