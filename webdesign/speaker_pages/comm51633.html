<br>Title: Robust Multiproduct Pricing and Learning</br><br>Author: Andew Lim, Professor, University of California, Department of IEOR, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, lim@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Shanthikumar, Thaisiri Watewai</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of robust pricing and discuss an interesting duality relationship that arises in the context of this problem. The duality is a nontrivial extension of the well known equivalence between ``risk-sensitive control and ``robust control and involves in an essential way the notion of revenue sharing (which comes about because of resource sharing). If there is time, we also consider the problem of robust pricing and learning.</br>
