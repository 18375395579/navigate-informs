Title: Competitive and Dynamic Pricing in a Inventory-concerned Duopoly<br>Author: Varun Gupta, University of Texas-Dallas, Richardson, TX, United States of America, varun.gupta@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Metin Cakanyildirim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study dynamic and competitive pricing that sell a generic product to the same market. Retailers dynamically price the product while taking the inventory levels into consideration. We develop a choice model based on preferences to model customer choices. Further, we also discuss the application of this model in specific applications such as airline revenue management and employee recruitment.
