Title: Multiple Supplier Competition under Consignment Inventory Programs with Competing Retailers<br>Author: Ming Hu, Assistant Professor, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, ming.hu@rotman.utoronto.ca<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the equilibrium behavior of a Stackerlberg game in two-echelon supply chains, where a set of competing suppliers serves a network of competing retailers. In this Stackelberg games, the suppliers first set wholesale prices simultaneously and then the retailers simultaneously set retail prices. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium to the Stackelberg game with deterministic or stochastic demand.
