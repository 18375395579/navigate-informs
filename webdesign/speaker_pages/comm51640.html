The retailer commits to a minimum purchase quantity to facilitate pre-shipment financing, which enables the supplier to extend his debt capacity and indirectly also his production level. Key parameters are the creditworthiness of the retailer and the supplier, and the characteristics of the product market. Using a newsvendor model, we analyze the strategic interaction of the two players as a Stackelberg game.</br>
