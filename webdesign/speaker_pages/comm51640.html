Title: Pre-shipment Financing: Credit Capacities and Supply Chain Consequences<br>Author: Matthew Reindorp, Assistant Professor, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, Netherlands, m.j.reindorp@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Anna Lange, Fehmi Tanrisever<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a supply chain where a retailer buys from a debt-constrained supplier. The retailer commits to a minimum purchase quantity to facilitate pre-shipment financing, which enables the supplier to extend his debt capacity and indirectly also his production level. Key parameters are the creditworthiness of the retailer and the supplier, and the characteristics of the product market. Using a newsvendor model, we analyze the strategic interaction of the two players as a Stackelberg game.
