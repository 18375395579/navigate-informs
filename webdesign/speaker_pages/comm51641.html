The costly effort engaged by a retailer may increase or decrease the demands of other retailers. We show that traditional contracts coordinate only under very restrictive conditions. We propose revenue sharing with fixed target rebate. These contracts are shown to be both coordinating and flexible. Interestingly, similar contracts have been used in the fresh food industry to motivate retailers to promote the products.</br>
