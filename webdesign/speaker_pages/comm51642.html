The customer experience is thus dependent on the retailer’s shipping the product out on time, as well as the performance of the various downstream service providers that are employed to deliver the product to the customers. To achieve a high service level it is necessary to understand the drivers behind failures in these processes, and to design systems to identify those failures. We present a data driven approach to identifying the critical processes and quantify their performance. The metrics defined can be used to minimize process deficiencies and improve the overall service level. In addition, we discuss how the insights gained could potentially be used to redesign the choices downstream of the warehouse, with the goal of achieving an overall service level.</br>
