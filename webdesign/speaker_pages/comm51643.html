Concurrency  arises from auctions that take place over the same time period  and interact with each other. Interaction can  occur in the form of bidders participating in simultaneous  auctions or in the form of sellers evaluating their competition and  adjusting selling strategies. In this work we consider  several ways of measuring, visualizing and modeling concurrency in  online auctions.</br>
