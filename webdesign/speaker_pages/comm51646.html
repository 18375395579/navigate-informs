Title: The Role of Product Modularity in Reverse Logistics<br>Author: Thomas Nowak, Teaching and Research Associate, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Nordbergstraﬂe 15, Vienna, 1090, Austria, thomas.nowak@wu.ac.at<br>Coauthor(s): Fuminori Toyasaki, Tina Wakolbinger<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Product design issues play a crucial role in determining a productís life-cycle duration, costs and environmental impacts. In this paper, we study how a productís degree of modularity affects consumer valuation, life expectancy, return quantities and resulting manufacturers' profits. We develop an inter-temporal stochastic nonlinear optimization model that reflects a companyís product design decision problem. Model insights can assist companies in making design decisions under uncertainties.
