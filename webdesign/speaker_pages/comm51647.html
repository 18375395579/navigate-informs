<br>Title: A Dynamic Model to Study Sustainable Business Policies in a Closed Loop Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Sudip Bhattacharjee, Associate Professor, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, United States of America, sbhattacharjee@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jose Cruz</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The sustainability of a closed loop supply chain depends on the economic viability of all actors in the chain. We model the phenomenon analytically and create dynamic models to study key factors that impact profitability of partners in the chain. We find that product design, marketing and related actions of up-market producers significantly influence the ability of down-market recyclers to survive. We discuss environmental and revenue implications of several policy scenarios.</br>
