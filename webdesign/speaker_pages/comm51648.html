We formulate the dynamic pricing problem and derive the optimal prices for both the old and new products. Our analysis identifies the key dynamics affecting the optimal prices: product replacement, scarcity, inventory, and internal and external competition. In addition, we propose a simple and pragmatic approach to incorporate demand learning into the pricing decisions.</br>
