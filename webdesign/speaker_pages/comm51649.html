An alternative is individual compliance. We compare these schemes based on cost to the manufacturer and on environmental benefits. We show that high collection targets and large market shares among partner firms make collective compliance more cost effective. We provide insights on the tradeoff between collection rate targets and the effectiveness of incentives for recyclability.</br>
