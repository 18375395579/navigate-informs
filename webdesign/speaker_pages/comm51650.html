Title: IPOs, Financial Hedging and Product Market Competition<br>Author: Jiri Chod, Boston College, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA, United States of America, chodj@bc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Evgeny Lyandres<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Because public firms tend to be less risk averse than private firms, they tend to compete more aggressively in uncertain product markets, which in turn improves their competitive position vis-a-vis private firms. Because this benefit of being public increases with the competition intensity, our model predicts a higher proportion of public firms in more competitive markets.
