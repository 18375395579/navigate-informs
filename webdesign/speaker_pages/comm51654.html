Title: Dynamic Pricing of Limited Inventories When Customers Negotiate<br>Author: Chia-Wei Kuo, Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, cwkuo@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Goker Aydin, Hyun-Soo Ahn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a firm who adjusts the sticker price dynamically in the course of a selling season. Each customer observes the posted price and engages in a negotiation process to complete the purchase. We explore the interaction between dynamic pricing and negotiation and show how inventory and remaining selling period affect the seller's optimal pricing policy.
