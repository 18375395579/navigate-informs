Title: Multi-sourcing Procurement Auctions with Exogenous Splits<br>Author: Bernardo Quiroga, PhD Student, The University of Texas at Dallas, 800 W Campbell Rd., Naveen Jindal School of Management, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, bquiroga@psualum.com<br>Coauthor(s): Aadhaar Chaturvedi, Elena Katok, Damian Beil<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The idea behind multi-sourcing reverse auctions is that those suppliers invited to participate are not simply used to reduce the price of the lowest bidder, but also can get a smaller contract in the event when they are not the lowest bidder. We analyze what happens to the incentives triggered by a mechanism with pre-determined splits in the bidders participating in these markets, using both game theory and human subject experiments.
