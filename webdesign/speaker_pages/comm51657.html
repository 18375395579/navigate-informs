<br>Title: How Does Free Riding on Customer Service Affect Competition?</br><br>Author: Jiwoong Shin, Assistant Professor, Yale University, 135 Prospect St., New Haven, CT, 06520, United States, jiwoong.shin@yale.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The paper shows that free riding benefits not only the free riding retailer but also service provider. The service provider has a postservice advantage, because of shopping cost. Also, allowing free riding gives the free rider less incentive to compete on price, because many customers eventually will switch to it through free riding. In turn, this induced soft strategic response enables the service provider to charge a higher price and enjoy positive profit.</br>
