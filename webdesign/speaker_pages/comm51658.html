Title: Operations with Subscribers<br>Author: Ramandeep Randhawa, Stanford University, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, United States, randhawa_ramandeep@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sunil Kumar<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study a monopolistic firm that offers reusable products to price and quality-of-service sensitive customers. We study the alternatives of offering either a subscription option or a pay-per-use option. In a large market setting under an exponential demand assumption we show that the subscription option is more profitable for the firm. A numerical study suggests that this assumption is not essential. Moreover the social welfare and consumer surplus can also be higher in the subscription option.
