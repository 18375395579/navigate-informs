Title: Analytical Insights into the Two-Stage Supply Chain Configuration Problem<br>Author: Sean Willems, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, Boston University, School of Management, SMG 673, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States, willems@bu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): N. Grace Hua<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This research demonstrates how leadtime and cost impact total supply chain landed cost, inventory placement and the optimal supply chain configuration. We prove the relative importance of cost of good sold versus inventory cost drives whether or not a high cost low leadtime option is preferred; also, we show that there is benefit to synchronize the supply chain. Finally, we analytically prove the downstream stage is more likely to choose a high cost low leadtime option than the upstream stage.
