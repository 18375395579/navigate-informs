Title: Airline Contracts, Government Regulation and the International Airline Market<br>Author: Benny Mantin, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue W, Waterloo, ON, N2L3G1, Canada, bmantin@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Nicole Adler<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Governments sign liberalization agreements to regulate the airborne traffic between the two countries, whereas airlines engage in code share contracts to set the level of coordination and pooling of resources. Empirically studying the effects of code share and liberalization agreements on international non-stop routes, we find that the level of the liberalization agreement has a significant impact on frequency, and that the types of code share agreements have different effects on airfares.
