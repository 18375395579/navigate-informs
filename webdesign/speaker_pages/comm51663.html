Consumers' purchasing decisions take into account their inter-temporal valuations as well as their potential opportunity to resell the tickets. We compare the revenues from fixed pricing, dynamic pricing and pricing with options, and consider how the capacity provider's revenues change with respect to the transaction cost of resale under each pricing strategy.
