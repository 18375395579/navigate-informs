<br>Title: Should Event Organizers Prevent Resale of Tickets?</br><br>Author: Yao Cui, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, cuiyao@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Izak Duenyas, Ozge Sahin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We are interested in whether preventing consumer resale of tickets benefits capacity providers for sporting and entertainment events. Consumers' purchasing decisions take into account their inter-temporal valuations as well as their potential opportunity to resell the tickets. We compare the revenues from fixed pricing, dynamic pricing and pricing with options, and consider how the capacity provider's revenues change with respect to the transaction cost of resale under each pricing strategy.</br>
