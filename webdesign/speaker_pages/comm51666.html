Title: Procurement Auctions with an Incumbent and Partially Qualified Entrant<br>Author: Zhixi Wan, PhD Candidate, Stephen M.

We find that the incumbent strategically drops out early to forestall a bidding war, depending on his cost, degree of risk aversion, and the entrant's qualification probability. We show it is optimal for the buyer to prevent this by attempting to qualify the entrant before the auction only when the qualification cost is small and the entrant's qualification probability is moderate.
