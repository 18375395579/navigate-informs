<br>Title: Global Sourcing Decisions for a Multinational Firm With Foreign Tax Credit Planning</br><br>Author: Wenqiang Xiao, NYU, Stern School of Business, NYC, United States of America, wxiao@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vernon Ning Hsu, Joice Qiaohao Hu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study sourcing decisions in a subsidiary of an MNF with FTCs  planning. We show that an improvement in the firm's after-tax profitability, through tax cross-crediting, increased profit margin, or reduced tax rate, may induce the sourcing manager to order less, not more; and that the optimal sourcing decision under certain circumstances can be made without the knowledge of the demand distribution.</br>
