<br>Title: Production Planning and Common Part Strategy in Closed-loop-supply Chains</br><br>Author: Jenny Steinborn, TU Braunschweig, Institut for Production and Logistics Management, Katharinenstrasse 3, Braunschweig, 38106, Germany, j.steinborn@tu-bs.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Grit Walther, Thomas S. Spengler</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: For OEMs with many product variants, a combination of product and component recycling strategies hold economic potentials. But strategies have to be implemented into forward production planning regarding rivalry for returned products and uncertainties. A model is developed for integrated production and recycling planning on tactical level. Returned products are allocated to recycling strategies allowing assessment of feasibility of recycling strategies and impact on demand for new components.</br>
