Title: Demand Shaping through Bundling: A Dynamic Multiproduct Inventory-pricing Model<br>Author: Jeannette Song, Professor, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, 1 Towerview Dr., Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, jssong@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhengliang Xue<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Motivated by the increasingly popular industry practice of using product bundling to shape demand, we present a dynamic model to analyze optimal joint inventory, pricing, and bundling decisions for a firm over a finite horizon. A product can be either a single component or a package of several components. The product demand is random and price-sensitive. Using a dynamic programming formulation, we show how bundling strategies switch according to the inventory status and product features.
