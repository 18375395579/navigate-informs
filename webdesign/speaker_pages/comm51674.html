Sebastian Heese</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Manufacturers that sell complementary products can benefit from considering the resulting interdependencies. While using independent retailers makes it difficult to internalize this positive externality, it leads to double marginalization which mitigates within-market competition. We use standard game theoretic analysis to determine the optimal distribution channel structure (through independent retailers or integrated) for competing manufacturers that participate in markets for complements.</br>
