Title: Mechanisms for Increasing Locally Sourced Fresh Produce<br>Author: Deishin Lee, Boston College, Boston, MA, United States of America, deishin.lee@bc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Baris Ata, Mustafa Tongarlak<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study two mechanisms for incorporating more locally sourced fresh produce into the food supply chain: backhauling (used by Walmart) and differentiation (used by Red Tomato). We show that there can be a tradeoff between leveraging operational efficiency and capturing demand-side value. Moreover, the two mechanisms can be substitutes.
