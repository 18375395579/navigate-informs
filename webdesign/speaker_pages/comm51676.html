Title: Information Reliability in Supply Chains: The Case of Multiple Retailers<br>Author: Eirini Spiliotopoulou, PhD Candidate in Supply Chain Management, MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, Edificio Náyade 5, C/ Bari 55 - PLAZA, Zaragoza, Spain, espiliotopoulou@zlc.edu.es<br>Coauthor(s): Karen Donohue, Mustafa Cagri Gurbuz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Multiple retailers form a pooling coalition and delegate inventory management to a benevolent central planner (CP). Each retailer faces uncertain demand and has private information about it due to his proximity to the market. We focus on whether reliable demand information sharing occurs between retailers and the CP. We study analytically and experimentally the impact of a) competition for common inventory and b) market uncertainty on information distortion, trust and supply chain efficiency.
