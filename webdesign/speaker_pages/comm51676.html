Each retailer faces uncertain demand and has private information about it due to his proximity to the market. We focus on whether reliable demand information sharing occurs between retailers and the CP. We study analytically and experimentally the impact of a) competition for common inventory and b) market uncertainty on information distortion, trust and supply chain efficiency.</br>
