Title: Collusion in Buyer-determined Procurement Auctions<br>Author: Elena Katok, Associate Professor, Penn State University, 465 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, ekatok@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Achim Wambach<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a new theory that shows that collusion is sometimes an equilibrium in buyer-determined procurement auctions. We test this theory in the laboratory and find that when buyer use non-price attributes to make their final decisions, and supplier do not know the value of their own non-price attributes, collusive behavior results.
