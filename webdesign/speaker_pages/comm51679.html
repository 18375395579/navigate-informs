<br>Title: Revenue Management for Online Advertising</br><br>Author: Kristin Fridgeirsdottir, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, kfridgeirsdottir@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victor Araman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The Internet offers many advantages as an advertising medium compared to traditional media. We develop a new modelling framework for the operation of a web host that generates revenues from selling advertising space on its website. We show that the models developed have some similarities to known queueing systems but also some fundamental differences. We analyze different service disciplines and study the revenue maximization problem of the web host.</br>
