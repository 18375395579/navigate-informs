Title: Bundling and Pricing in a Duopoly Environment<br>Author: Shu Zhou, Assistant Professor, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA, 95192, United States, zhou_s@cob.sjsu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinagesh Gavirneni<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In a duopoly with two products, when the companies are allowed to use the mixed bundling strategies, the leader no longer dominates the follower in terms of gaining a competitive edge. This is in complete contrast to the setting in which only pure bundling strategies are allowed. We explore the main reasons for this behavior and also evaluate the impact of randomness on these results.
