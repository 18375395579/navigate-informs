<br>Title: Optimal Assortment Planning Under Dynamic Substitution: A Homogeneous Population Model and Extension</br><br>Author: Dorothee Honhon, University of Texas, Dorothee.Honhon@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the optimal assortment and inventory levels for a discrete set of products with varying prices and costs in order to maximize expected profit in a single-period setting. Customer preferences are modeled through the definition of consumer types, where a type is a ranking of the potential products by order of preference. We first address the case in which all customers are of the same type, extend the results to more general choice models.</br>
