Stecke</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Consider a decentralized system of retailers that order/sell the same product. When a customer demand occurs at a stocked-out retailer, that retailer can request a unit to be transshipped from the other retailer. If this request is rejected, the unsatisfied customer can go to the other retailer with a demand overflow probability. Each retailer maximizing own profit makes two types of decisions: initially the order quantity from a manufacturer and afterwards transshipment decisions.</br>
