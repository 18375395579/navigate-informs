Contracts are auctioned periodically and the buyer seeks to minimize long-term expected costs. Suppliers in the same region have correlated costs, and the buyer can mitigate the influence of correlated costs by choosing suppliers from different regions. We characterize the buyer's optimal supply base diversification strategy and show how it depends upon her bargaining power.</br>
