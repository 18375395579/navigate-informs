Title: Electric Power Financial Hedging Strategy<br>Author: Jo Min, Iowa State University, IMSE Department, 2019 Black, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, jomin@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Chung-Hsiao Wang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Electric power utilities often use financial forward contracts to hedge against risk exposure of their physical power.  Because financial forward market is not liquid for non-peak hours, we investigate the strategy of selling additional on-peak forwards to hedge against risk exposure of non-peak power.  Optimal amount of on-peak forwards is determined by value at risk (VaR) approach which measures the maximum loss expected within a given time period.
