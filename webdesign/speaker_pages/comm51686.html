Because financial forward market is not liquid for non-peak hours, we investigate the strategy of selling additional on-peak forwards to hedge against risk exposure of non-peak power.  Optimal amount of on-peak forwards is determined by value at risk (VaR) approach which measures the maximum loss expected within a given time period.</br>
