It is a characteristic feature of such auctions, however, that information about some bidders' valuations is systematically concealed. This occurs in the sense that some bidders may fail to bid at all because the asking price exceeds their valuations, and also in the sense that a high bidder may not be compelled to reveal her valuation. Ignoring these hidden bids can introduce bias into the estimation of valuation distributions. To overcome this problem, we propose an EM-based algorithm, which we validate experimentally using agents that react to their environments both decision-theoretically and game-theoretically, and using both synthetic and real-world (eBay) datasets. We show that our approach estimates bidders' valuation distributions and the distribution over the true number of bidders significantly more accurately than more straightforward density estimation techniques.</br>
