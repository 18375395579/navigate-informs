We consider a two-stage supply chain model in which the retailer faces an autoregressive integrated moving average demand. The empirical value of information sharing is mostly positive. The key reason is the batching effect component. We shows that the demand propagates to a semi-ARIMA order process. The empirical value of information sharing is consistent with the numerical result from the theory.</br>
