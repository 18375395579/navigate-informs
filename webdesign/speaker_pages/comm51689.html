<br>Title: Relative Prices, Trade, Technology and Wage Inequality - Evidence from India</br><br>Author: Somesh Mathur, HSS,IITK, Kanpur, India, skmathur@iitk.ac.in</br><br>Coauthor(s): Archana Srivastava</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The paper examines the link between relative export, import and domestic goods prices and relative wages over the years by empirically testing the Stolper Samuelson theorem for India. The paper also examines the role of other factors such as manufacturing trade, liberalization phase, inflation, foreign and domestic technology etc., on rising wage inequality in the manufacturing sector of India.     The results seem to prove the validity of Stolper Samuelson theorem.  Along with Stolper Samuelson theorem, it also throws some light on Rybczynski theorem which shows the relationship between output and endowment and factor price insensitivity elasticity which shows the link between factor endowments and factor prices. The empirical testing is done using estimates of the translog production function and translog cost function along with the share equations. Elasticity of substitution between factors of production has been worked out using Allens' and Morishma formulae which in turn uses estimates of the translog Cost Function.</br>
