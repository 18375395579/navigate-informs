We consider a model in which suppliers have asymmetric cost information and manufacturers have alternative sources of supply with cost known only to them. We study how the complexity of contracts, the manufacturers?beliefs about the suppliers?costs as well as the underlying supply chain structure influences the optimal decision.</br>
