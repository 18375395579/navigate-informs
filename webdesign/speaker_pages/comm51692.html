In this paper, we investigate benefits of such an alliance for collaborative procurement. We take heterogeneity of the customer base into account when the products of firms are differentiated. In such a supply chain network, we find that joint consideration of sourcing, pricing, and demand generation objectives may result in non-trivial outcomes.
