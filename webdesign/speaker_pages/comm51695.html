Title: Acquisition Management under Fluctuating Raw Material Prices<br>Author: Jian Yang, Assistant Professor, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Department of Industrial Engineering, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States, yang@adm.njit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yusen Xia<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study a raw material acquisition problem in which the raw material price follows a Markov process and demand is compound Poisson. We show that an optimal policy is of the order-up-to type. Under our mean reversion and time continuity conditions, we show that the order-up-to levels are further decreasing in the current price level. At the same time, our computation study verifies that both conditions are indispensable for the monotonicity result.
