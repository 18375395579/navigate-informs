Title: Product-Line Competition:  Customization vs Proliferation<br>Author: Ali Parlakturk, Ali_Parlakturk@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haim Mendelson<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a market with customers who have heterogeneous preferences for product attributes. We consider two types of firms that compete on price and product variety: A traditional firm, which chooses a limited set of product configurations, and a customizing firm, which can produce any configuration to order. The traditional firm carries product inventories and experiences a lead-time delay. The customizing firm does not carry inventory and its customers incur waiting costs.
