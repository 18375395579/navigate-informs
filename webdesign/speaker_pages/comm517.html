Windle</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Traditional analysis of multipoint competition suggests that firms compete less intensely with one another when they have strategic contacts across multiple markets (the mutual forbearance effect). However, this argument does not account for the moderating role that production cost plays in these market relationships.  This article examines the collusion-enhancing effects of multimarket contact and its effect on competition by using a model verified through data from the U.S. airline industry.</br>
