Both contracts allow the firm to purchase at discrete intervals over a given period of time. A time-flexible contract requires the firm to specify how many units it will purchase at each time, while the firm does not have commitment to purchase the specified quantity at each time. Quantity flexible contract allows the firm to purchase any discrete quantity within specified quantity window.</br>
