It seems intuitive that they are substitutes in hedging supply uncertainty. We find that they are actually complements under certain conditions. Specifically, when the cost of lost goodwill is low and suppliers' costs are medium, the firm's diversification propensity is higher and it can gain higher value of diversification with responsive pricing than without.</br>
