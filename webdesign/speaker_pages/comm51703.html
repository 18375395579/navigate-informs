<br>Title: Service Competition and Product Quality in the U.S. Automobile Industry</br><br>Author: Jose Guajardo, josegu@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Morris Cohen, Serguei Netessine</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We formulate and estimate a structural econometric model to study the role of services in the U.S. automobile industry. We analyze the impact of service attributes on demand, and test whether the effects of service attributes and product quality are independent, complementary or substitutes. Our findings indicate that service attributes act as complements in the demand function, and conversely, that service attributes play the role of substitutes with respect to product quality.</br>
