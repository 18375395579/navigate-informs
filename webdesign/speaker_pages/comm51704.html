S. Krishnan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the moderating influence of IT investment and flexible IT infrastructure in the effect of alliance activity on firm performance, distinguishing between collaborative and transactional alliances. We draw from a cross section of over 120 firms that span multiple industries, and that have collectively engaged in more than 8100 alliances over a period of 10 years. Our results indicate that IT enables firms to derive greater value from collaborative alliance activity.
