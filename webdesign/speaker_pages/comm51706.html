Title: Delegation vs. Control of Component Procurement Under Multi-Level Asymmetric Information<br>Author: Enis Kayis, Graduate Student, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, ekayis@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Erica Plambeck, Feryal Erhun<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Should a manufacturer delegate component procurement to her contract manufacturer, or contract with the component supplier directly, given that both have private cost information? Under simple price-only contracts or complex optimal contracts, the manufacturer should maintain control. We recommend simple-but-effective quantity discount contracts, under which delegation becomes optimal under general conditions.
