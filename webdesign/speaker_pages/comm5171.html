<br>Title: Markdown Management at Sports Unlimited</br><br>Author: Masoud Talebian, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, Australia, Masoud.Talebian@newcastle.edu.au</br><br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The case study focuses on the analytical aspects of designing markdown policies.  For this purpose, it describes a retail sporting goods chain that operates nationally.  Merchants (buyers) are responsible for buying items and setting initial prices. During  the sales season, merchants evaluate items for possible markdowns and eventually  mark them out-of-store so that they can be salvaged. Merchants currently rely on a  price optimization tool, called PO, to manage markdowns. PO essentially identifies  the items with low weekly sell-through rates as candidates for markdowns. Weekly  sell-through is measured as the ratio of weekly sales to initial inventory. The firm’s  current policy is to target an initial markdown of 50%.</br>
