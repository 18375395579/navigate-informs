Title: Revenue Management with Price Bargaining<br>Author: Nicola Secomandi, Assistant Professor, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, ns7@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Atul Bhandari<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the revenue management problem of a seller who owns a finite inventory of a single product that can be sold during an infinite horizon when demand is Bernoulli.  We study the seller’s performance when (1) the seller has all the price bargaining ability, the typical dynamic pricing case studied in the literature, (2) this ability resides entirely with the buyers, (3) it is equally shared by the seller and the buyers, and (4) price negotiations are structured.
