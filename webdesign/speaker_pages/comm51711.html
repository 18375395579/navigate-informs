Title: Supply Chain Coordination with Two-direction Adjustment Contract<br>Author: Rong Li, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 50 Stamford Road, Singapore, 178899, Singapore, rongli@smu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Ryan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study coordination issues for a supply chain, which consists of a retailer and a supplier, who provides a short-life product under a wholesale price contract and an adjustment contract. The retailer can purchase at a low price before the selling season. In the middle of the selling season, the retailer can adjust inventory level upwards or downwards at a higher cost under the adjustment contract, which reduces the inventory risk for the supply chain.
