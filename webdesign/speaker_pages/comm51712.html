Title: Non-Cooperative Outsourcing Games<br>Author: Tolga Aydinliyim, Case Western Reserve University, Weatherhead School of Management, 11119 Bellflower Road, Cleveland,, OH, 44106, United States, tolga.aydinliyim@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): George Vairaktarakis<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We present a non-cooperative outsourcing model where each manufacturer processes part of his jobs on a dedicated in-house machine and sends his remaining jobs to a third-party. The third-party has a flexible machine which can process jobs from all manufacturers. Each manufacturer's strategy is determined as the set of jobs to be processed on the flexible machine. The Nash Equilibrium schedule and the centralized schedule do not necessarily coincide, so savings due to coordination are possible. We present structural properties, algorithms and coordination results.
