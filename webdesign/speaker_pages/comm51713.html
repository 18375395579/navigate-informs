Title: Strategic Risk from Supply Chain Disruptions<br>Author: Zigeng Yin, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Tech C231, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, z-yin@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wallace Hopp, Seyed Iravani<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Supply chain disruptions can result in both tactical (e.g., loss of short-term sales) and strategic (e.g., loss of long-term market share) consequences. In this talk, we present a model that captures the impact of supply disruptions on competing supply chains. We use our analytic and numerical results to highlight the situations that present the greatest risk and to identify policies for mitigating these risks.
