In this paper, we consider two approaches: joint audit and sharing quality information of suppliers. Based on a model with both cooperative and competitive interactions between firms, we investigate the impacts of the two approaches on product quality and the incentives of manufacturers to conduct joint audit or share their private supplier information.
