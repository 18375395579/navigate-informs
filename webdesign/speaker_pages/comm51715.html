Title: Capacity Rationing in Two-Channel Supply Chain with Herding Externalities<br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a firm selling a product that has uncertain quality through both direct and indirect channels. Each arriving customer observes private, imperfect information about the quality. A customer arriving at one channel complements his private information about the quality of the product by the inventory levels. We answer (i) How the inventory levels influence the customer purchasing behavior and (ii) How the manufacturer can strategically allocate his production capacity.
