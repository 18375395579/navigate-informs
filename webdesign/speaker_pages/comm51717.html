Title: Intermediated Sourcing under Supply Disruption Risk<br>Author: Zhibin (Ben) Yang, Assistant Professor, University of Oregon, 1208 University of Oregon, Eugene, 97403, United States of America, zyang@uoregon.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Volodymyr Babich<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We analyze a model where multiple buyers decide whether to procure goods from unreliable suppliers directly or using an intermediary firm. We show that low-revenue buyers may enjoy spill-over benefits of procurement cost reduction when high-revenue buyers choose to use the intermediary. Intermediation may also reduce system-wide product waste, by coordinating diversification efforts across buyers.  These benefits have to be weighed against intermediation costs, such as double-marginalization.
