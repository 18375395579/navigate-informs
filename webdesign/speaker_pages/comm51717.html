We show that low-revenue buyers may enjoy spill-over benefits of procurement cost reduction when high-revenue buyers choose to use the intermediary. Intermediation may also reduce system-wide product waste, by coordinating diversification efforts across buyers.  These benefits have to be weighed against intermediation costs, such as double-marginalization.</br>
