Title: Balancing Marketability and Manufacturability in Product Line Design Optimization<br>Author: Jeremy Michalek, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Scaife Hall 323, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, jmichalek@cmu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Product development involves communication and compromise among interacting and often competing objectives from marketing, design, and manufacturing perspectives; particularly when developing product lines for heterogeneous markets. This study demonstrates a methodology for explicitly quantifying tradeoffs between market performance and manufacturing cost for a line of consumer durables to achieve realizable product line solutions with optimal profitability.
