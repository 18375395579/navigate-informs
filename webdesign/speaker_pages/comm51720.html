Title: Incentive Compensation and the Choice of Inventory Buffer in Production Systems<br>Author: Serguei Netessine, Associate Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut St. Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, netessin@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stanley Baiman, Richard Saouma<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The inventory buffer (kanban) is an essential part of Toyota production system.  We model a two-stage (tandem) production system in which the principal needs to motivate two workers. We show that the size of kanban is an effective mechanism by which the principal can motivate the downstream worker to work harder as well as to motivate the upstream worker to help the downstream worker.
