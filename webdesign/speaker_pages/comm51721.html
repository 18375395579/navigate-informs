Title: Stable Cooperation in Periodic Review Inventory Situations<br>Author: Ana Meca, Professor, Universidad Miguel Hernandez, Operations Research Center, Elche, Spain, ana.meca@umh.es<br>Coauthor(s): Luis A. Guardiola, Justo Puerto<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper examines coordination in periodic review inventory models in which agents can share ordering, inventory holding, and backlogging resources. We analyze the resulting cooperative game and show that the cooperation is stable (no group of agents would like to leave the system). A family of fair divisions of costs is introduced and the relation to other inventory coordination models from the literature is studied.
