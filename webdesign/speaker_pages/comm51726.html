Title: Corporate Budgeting: Lindahl Auctions and Return-on-investment Auctions<br>Author: Matthias Hild, matthias@hild.org<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Company-internal markets suffer from imperfect competition and externalities, while VCG mechanisms create a complex bidding task in the case of heterogeneous resources. We propose two auction designs in which truth-telling is weakly dominant in the limit. The first operationalizes Lindahl's markets with individualized prices, the second adjusts quantities based on return-on-investment bids. Both designs build on Ausubel's payment rule and Shor's subgradient algorithm.
