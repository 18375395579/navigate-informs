We propose two auction designs in which truth-telling is weakly dominant in the limit. The first operationalizes Lindahl's markets with individualized prices, the second adjusts quantities based on return-on-investment bids. Both designs build on Ausubel's payment rule and Shor's subgradient algorithm.</br>
