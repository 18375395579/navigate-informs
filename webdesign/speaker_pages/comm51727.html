Title: Countervailing Power, Commitment, and Strategic Quality Improvement<br>Author: Rui Yin, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, W. P. Carey School of Business, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, Rui.Yin@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yimin Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A critical factor that influences product quality is supply chain members' joint improvement efforts. In this research we explore two important financial and operational levers that may impact their joint improvement efforts: countervailing power and commitment. We examine the implications of these two levers on the manufacturer and supplier’s optimal quality improvement efforts and profits, when their efforts are complements or substitutes.
