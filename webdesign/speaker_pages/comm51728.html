Title: Risk-averse Policies in a One-Warehouse Multiple-Retailer System with Demand and Supply Uncertainty<br>Author: Amanda Schmitt, Ph.D Candidate, Lehigh University ISE Dept., 200 W.

We show that while risk pooling generates lower expected costs in a centralized strategy, risk diversification generates lower risk in a decentralized strategy. We demonstrate that under certain risk-averse objectives, decentralizing inventory is the optimal policy for the OWMR system.
