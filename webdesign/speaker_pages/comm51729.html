<br>Title: Signaling to Partially Informed Investors in the Newsvendor Model</br><br>Author: William Schmidt, Harvard Business School, Wyss House, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, wschmidt@hbs.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vishal Gaur, Ananth Raman, Richard Lai</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the effect of short-term objectives and incomplete information on a firm's operational decisions. We incorporate the newsvendor model using discrete stocking quantities into a signaling game and identify the circumstances under which the firm's choice of stocking quantity purposefully does not maximize expected profits. Our model provides analytical support for the abundant anecdotal evidence that superior firms will knowingly under-invest in capacity under certain circumstances.</br>
