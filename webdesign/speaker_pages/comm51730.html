Title: Signaling in Social Networks<br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, United States of America, chen@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Junjie Zhou<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the optimal selling scheme with the positive externality among the consumers, the seller's price discrimination power, and the inherent information transmissions among them. We identify the consumers' intrinsic signaling incentives and the positive feedback effects. The optimal hierarchy turns out to be a chain structure in which the seller sells the products to the consumers one by one, and the revenue-maximizing pricing features the cream skimming strategy.
