Xia, Research Scientist, IBM Research, TJ Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, cathyx@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We revisit the problem of dynamic pricing with demand uncertainty.  It has been reported that under the Bayesian Dynamic Programming formulation, the ex ante optimal pricing policy may lead to price dispersion and result in an ex post suboptimal price choice. Such a suboptimal price may hurt the total profit in the long run.  We present alternative formulations and dynamic pricing strategies so as to achieve both profitability and the convergence to the ex post optimal price in the long run.</br>
