Evidence from eBay</br><br>Author: Ivy Li, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States, lingfanl@uci.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper tries to identify why buyers fail to leave (negative) feedback in eBay. One potential reason is that it takes more time to leave negative feedback, and another reason is fear of retaliation. Empirical results show that the fear of retaliation is an important motivation to keep silent. Thus, a potential rebate mechanism that the market maker can use to induce buyers to leave feedback is to provide an option for sellers to leave automatic feedback contingent on receiving payment.</br>
