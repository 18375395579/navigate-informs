Title: On the Profitability of an Eco-Friendly Supply Chain<br>Author: Yang Li, PhD Student, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, yang.li2@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fernando Bernstein, Kevin Shang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a two-stage supply chain for eco-friendly problems. The production technology for eco-friendly products is more costly, but these products use components with less fossil-fuel content than regular products. In particular, eco-friendly products are less exposed to the price volatility of petroleum. We examine scenarios in which eco-friendly products are more profitable.
