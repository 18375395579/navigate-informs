Title: Remanufacturing under Warranty and Consumer Returns<br>Author: Cerag Pince, cerag.pince@the-klu.org<br>Coauthor(s): Beril Toktay, Mark Ferguson<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a consumer electronics OEM selling a product and receiving consumer and warranty returns. The OEM can refurbish the consumer returns to sell in the refurbished market or to satisfy the warranty demand. Warranty demand may also be satisfied by the new products. We investigate the optimal strategy for the OEM maximizing its profit and identify the optimal prices for new and refurbished products, and the optimal quantity for refurbished products that shall be used to satisfy warranties.
