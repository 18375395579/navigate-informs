We show that the opportunity to sell “distressed?inventory through online channels to such last minute impulse travelers allows providers to increase revenues and load factor. While there is a chance of some revenue leakage because of travelers postponing purchases in anticipation of last minute sales, providers can overall benefit by this selling strategy.
