Title: Experimental Study of Market Reputation Mechanisms<br>Author: Tad Hogg, HP Labs, MS1139, 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, United States, tad.hogg@hp.com<br>Coauthor(s): Kay-Yut Chen, Cecilia Zentano<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We test reputation mechanisms revealing differing amounts of transaction history in a market where people need not fulfill contracts. People favored those with high reputation, and efficiency increased with the amount revealed. Since transaction verification is costly, we also tested a method where people rate transaction quality, analogous to eBay’s rating system. Most ratings accurately reflect actual transaction outcome, leading to efficiencies similar to revealing full transaction history.
