We propose a hierarchical linear model to examine the impact of offering promotions though location-based services on the growth rate of consumer traffic. We find (1) If more competitors offer specials through location-based services, the best strategy for a restaurant is to not offer specials; (2) the more competitors a restaurant has, the higher its growth rate will be.
