<br>Title: Lead Time and Price Decisions with Heterogenous Customers</br><br>Author: Xuying Zhao, Assistant Professor, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, South Bend, IN, United States, xuying.zhao@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ashutosh Prasad, Kathryn Stecke</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Service providers need to decide whether to provide uniform service to all customers or provide differentiated services with different lead times and different prices for customers to choose. Customers are characterized by their valuations for lead time reduction, which draw from a general distribution. We study the optimal lead time and price strategy for a service provider, under profit maximization and also under social optimization.</br>
