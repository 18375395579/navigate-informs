Title: Dynamic Pricing under a General Parametric Choice Model<br>Author: Paat Rusmevichientong, Associate Professor, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, rusmevic@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Josef Broder<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a stylized dynamic pricing model in which a monopolist prices a product to a sequence of customers, who independently make purchasing decisions based on the price offered according to a general parametric choice model.  The parameters of the model are unknown to the seller, whose objective is to determine a pricing policy that minimizes the regret.  We characterize the regret profile for this problem.
