We show that imposing a tax on the emissions of each firm can paradoxically lead to higher supply chain emissions. We also show that collaboration does not always guarantee lower emissions. We then devise a tax scheme under which maximal emission reduction can be achieved with lower tax rates, and a collaboration scheme under which it is possible to simultaneously reduce emission and cost.</br>
