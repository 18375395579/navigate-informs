Title: Carbon Taxes and Supply Chain Emissions<br>Author: Xi Chen, PhD Candidate, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, chen1644@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Saif Benjaafar<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the carbon emissions of a supply chain consisting of one retailer and one or more suppliers. We show that imposing a tax on the emissions of each firm can paradoxically lead to higher supply chain emissions. We also show that collaboration does not always guarantee lower emissions. We then devise a tax scheme under which maximal emission reduction can be achieved with lower tax rates, and a collaboration scheme under which it is possible to simultaneously reduce emission and cost.
