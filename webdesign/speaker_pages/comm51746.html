<br>Title: Demand Response in Energy Markets: Voluntary and Involuntary Load Curtailment Contracts</br><br>Author: Kaitlin Daniels, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street, JMHH Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, kaitd@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ruben Lobel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: As energy consumption grows, electricity grids are turning to demand response (DR) to meet peak demand and lower prices. These programs allow forgone energy consumption to be sold on the market during peak demand events. This project compares the performance of two types of DR contracts: involuntary, under which consumers relinquish control of their energy consumption in return for payment, and voluntary, which allow consumers to decide to reduce their load during each peak event.</br>
