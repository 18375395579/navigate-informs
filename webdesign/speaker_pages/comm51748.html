Depending on the willingness to pay of the customers, seats could remain empty or sold at a lower price at the departure date. We propose a stochastic dynamic pricing model to optimize the revenue of a given flight, applying phase type distributions and renewal processes to estimate the inter-arrival process and the probability that a customer buys a ticket.</br>
