Title: Reverse Production Systems: Centralized vs. Decentralized Models<br>Author: Jane Ammons, Associate Dean of Engineering for Faculty Affairs and Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, jane.ammons@isye.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jane Ammons, Matthew Realff<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A reverse production system is a network of transportation logistics and processing functions to collect, consolidate, refurbish, and demanufacture end-of-life products. We examine centralized and decentralized models of decision-making for material flows and associated transaction prices for these networks. The centralized approach may overestimate of system material flows and profit if the system planner utilizes a centralized view to predict behaviors of independent entities in the system.
