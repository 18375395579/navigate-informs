Title: Transshipment Policies of Independent Retailers<br>Author: Nagihan Comez, PhD Student, University of Texas at Dallas, United States, nagihan@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Metin Cakanyildirim, Kathryn Stecke<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study a decentralized system of two retailers selling a substitutable product. In case of a stock-out, an item can be transshipped to a stocked-out retailer from the other one. Customers can also move with a demand overflow probability. The model is characterized by two decisions: the transshipment and the initial replenishment decision which is a game. Our work combines pooling and demand substitution in a single model, where retailers use transshipment voluntarily under demand overflow.
