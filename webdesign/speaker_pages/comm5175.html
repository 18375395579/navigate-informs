In case of a stock-out, an item can be transshipped to a stocked-out retailer from the other one. Customers can also move with a demand overflow probability. The model is characterized by two decisions: the transshipment and the initial replenishment decision which is a game. Our work combines pooling and demand substitution in a single model, where retailers use transshipment voluntarily under demand overflow.</br>
