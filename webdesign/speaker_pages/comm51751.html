<br>Title: A Forward Capacity Market Model for Electricity</br><br>Author: Hung Po Chao, Director of Market Monitoring, Independent Systems Operator, New England, One Sullivan Road, Holyoke, MA, 01040, United States, hchao@iso-ne.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a multi-period forward capacity market for electricity that includes a primary capacity auction and multiple secondary reconfiguration auctions. The capacity is traded as an option with an energy strike price, which effectively sets an offer cap, as the marginal revenue for the capacity from energy market is capped at that level. Characterization of dynamic equilibrium for energy and capacity markets is established in a network. Market power issue is investigated.</br>
