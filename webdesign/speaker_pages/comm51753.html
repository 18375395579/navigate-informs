A supplier’s effective bid is a function of their bid price and an adjustment assigned by the buyer, capturing factors such as expected quality. Each supplier's adjustment is private information to him and the buyer. The buyer can (implicitly) announce her private adjustment cost information to all suppliers via an open auction, or conceal it by running a sealed-bid auction. We characterize the buyer's choice, and study the impact of additional suppliers.</br>
