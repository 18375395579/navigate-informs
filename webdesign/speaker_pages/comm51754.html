Title: Stability and Competitive Equilibrium in Trading Networks<br>Author: John Hatfield, Professor, Stanford Graduate School of Business, 655 Knight Way, Faculty Building East 313, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, hatfield_john@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Scott Duke Kominers, Alexandru Nichifor, Michael Ostrovsky, Alexander Westkamp<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We introduce a model in which agents in a network can trade via bilateral contracts. We find that when continuous transfers are allowed and utilities are quasilinear, the full substitutability of preferences is sufficient to guarantee the existence of stable outcomes for any underlying network structure. Furthermore, the set of stable outcomes is essentially equivalent to the set of competitive equilibria, and all stable outcomes are in the core and are efficient.
