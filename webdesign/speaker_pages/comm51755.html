Title: Sourcing for Quality: Pricing, Inspection, and Cooperation<br>Author: Cuihong Li, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, cli@business.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hsiao-Hui Lee<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A buyer can provide price incentive for the supplier to exert quality improvement effort, use inspection to screen out defective units, or spend her own resource on cooperating with the supplier to improve incoming quality. We investigate the use of the three instruments to manage quality. We consider complementary and substitutable relationships between buyer cooperation and supplier effort on quality improvement, and compare the results with observable and unobservable supplier effort.
