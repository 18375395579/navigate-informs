<br>Title: Flexible Urban Car Sharing System Design and Operations</br><br>Author: Guangrui Ma, PhD Candidate, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Dept. of IELM, Room 3208,, Kowloon, Hong Kong - PRC, magr@ust.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ho-Yin Mak</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Car sharing is becoming a popular solution to balance individual mobility needs and sustainability. But the unbalanced and time-variant usage behavior makes it difficult to match driving demand and vehicle availability. In this paper, we propose the use of pricing as a complementary solution to the direct repositioning strategy. We consider the use of surcharge pricing to adjust vehicle flow among different zones based on demand dynamics. Finally, we compare the efficiency of the two strategies.</br>
