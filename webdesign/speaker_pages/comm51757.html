<br>Title: Market Research and Innovation Strategy</br><br>Author: Elie Ofek, Associate Professor, Harvard Business School, Boston, MA, 02163, United States, eofek@hbs.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine innovation decisions in the face of uncertainty about consumer preferences. Firms determine R&D effort (direction and level) and also decide whether to conduct market research. We characterize equilibria where one firm conducts market research, while its rival undertakes R&D “blindly? If consumer preferences are sufficiently heterogeneous, the firm conducting market research may innovate on the less profitable attribute, while its rival innovates on the more profitable attribute.</br>
