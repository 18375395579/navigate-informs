Title: Dynamic Optimization of Short-term Financing with Reverse Factoring<br>Author: Arun Chockalingam, Assistant Professor, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, Netherlands, A.Chockalingam@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Fehmi Tanrisever, Matthew Reindorp<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: According to pecking order theory, firms resort to external sources to finance their operations when internal funds are limited. Firms may obtain short-term loans directly from banks or they may receive loans in the form of reverse factoring through the aid of other supply chain partners. We examine the trade-off between dynamically switching between traditional bank loans and reverse factoring as the risk-free rate of interest and customer demand fluctuate over time.
