Title: The Impact Utility Function has on the Retailer’s and Supplier’s Operational Strategies<br>Author: Candice Huynh, University of California, Irvine, Paul Merage School of Business, Irvine, CA, 92697-3125, United States of America, candich@uci.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wenting Pan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We examine the relationship between one retailer and one manufacturer engaging in a Vendor Managed Inventory contract. The manufacturer is risk-neutral and so his objective is to maximize his expected profit, while the retailer exhibits risk preferences, and therefore maximizes her expected utility. Using the expected utility theory framework, we compare the retailer’s utility under the VMI contract to the traditional newsvendor setting.
