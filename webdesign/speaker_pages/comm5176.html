The manufacturer is risk-neutral and so his objective is to maximize his expected profit, while the retailer exhibits risk preferences, and therefore maximizes her expected utility. Using the expected utility theory framework, we compare the retailer’s utility under the VMI contract to the traditional newsvendor setting.</br>
