At some point, investing in local hydroponic production will become viable.  Fuel price volatility creates a significant embedded real option value. This paper estimates the resulting hysteretic effect and develops a real-option investment-evaluation model.  The real option value is nearly 25% of the investment amount, so fuel prices will have to rise further to make investments worthwhile.</br>
