Title: Bargaining for an Assortment<br>Author: H. Sebastian Heese, Indiana University, 1309 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN, United States of America, hheese@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Goker Aydin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A retailer's assortment decision results from a process of give-and-take, during which the retailer may bid manufacturers against one another. We adopt a bargaining framework to capture such an assortment selection process. In our model, the retailer engages in simultaneous, bilateral negotiations with all manufacturers. We characterize the unique bargaining equilibrium, which specifies the profit allocated to the retailer and to each manufacturer.
