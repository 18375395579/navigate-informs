In our model, the buyer is able to sign long term contracts  that establish the likelihood with which the next period contract  is awarded to an entrant or the incumbent. We find that the buyer finds  it optimal to favor the incumbent, this generates more intense competition  between suppliers. In a two period model we are able to completely  characterize the optimal mechanism.</br>
