Title: Does it Make Sense to Favor Incumbent Suppliers in an Auction?<br>Author: Wedad Elmaghraby, UMD, Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, United States, Wedad_Elmaghraby@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Se-Kyoung Oh, J. Daniel Aromi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a game in which a buyer must repeatedly procure an input  from a set of firms. In our model, the buyer is able to sign long term contracts  that establish the likelihood with which the next period contract  is awarded to an entrant or the incumbent. We find that the buyer finds  it optimal to favor the incumbent, this generates more intense competition  between suppliers. In a two period model we are able to completely  characterize the optimal mechanism.
