Title: Simulation Modeling of the Street-to-fleet Supply Chain for the Builder Community<br>Author: Mehdi Amini, Professor, University of Memphis, mamini@memphis.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mike Racer, David Cashbaugh, Tanja Blackstone<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Traditional supply chain analysis focuses on tangible products.  To date, there has been surprising little research that has examined supply chains where the “products?are people. This study focuses on simulation modeling and analysis of the Navy’s “street-to-fleet?supply chain for the builder community. This supply chain is in charge of recruiting, training, and placement of sailors.
