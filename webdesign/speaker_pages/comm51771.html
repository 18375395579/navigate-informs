Title: Innovation Differences Among Industries and Over the Technology Life-cycle<br>Author: Scott Rockart, Duke University, srockart@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Lenox, Arie Lewin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The nature and extent of firms' innovation efforts is extremely important to social welfare and known to vary across industries and over the technology life-cycle.  In this paper, we use a computational model to replicate existing stylized facts and to develop novel predictions about how and why innovation efforts vary across industries and over time.  Specifically, we argue that inter-industry differences in the interdependencies in products or production processes influence competitive intensity and firms' ability to innovate and imitate one another, thus conditioning firms' choices of innovation policies as well as their innovative success.
