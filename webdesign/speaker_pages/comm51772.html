Title: A Data-driven Approach to Pricing with Learning in Competitive Environments<br>Author: Soulaymane Kachani, Professor, Columbia University, 334 Mudd Building, 500 W. 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States, kachani@ieor.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis, Carine Simon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a Bertrand oligopoly for perishable products. Firms?demands are initially unknown and are learnt through a data-driven approach. The goals of the firms are twofold: learn the price-demand relationship in order to find their best response pricing policies, and learn the equilibrium strategies. We study markets that are out of equilibrium as well as in equilibrium. We implement our approach on real data.
