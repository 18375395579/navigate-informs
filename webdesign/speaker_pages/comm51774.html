Title: Nonatomic-game Models for Dynamic Pricing under Competition<br>Author: Jian Yang, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Department of IME, Newark, 07102, United States of America, yang@njit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yusen Xia<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a revenue management problem involving competing firms. Adopting the nonatomic-game approach, we assume that no individual firm's pricing decision has any discernible impact on the evolution of overall market conditions. For both special deterministic- and stochastic-demand cases, we show the existence of reasonably-behaving equilibria. Our computational study reveals many useful insights.
