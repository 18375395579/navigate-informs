<br>Title: The Impact of Cost Uncertainty on the Network Design of Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Seokjin Kim, Assistant Professor, Suffolk University, Sawyer Business School, 8 Ashburton Place, Boston, MA, 02108, United States of America, kim@suffolk.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mozart Menezes, Rongbing Huang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A distribution center is to be located on a demand-populated unit line or plane with pre-located suppliers offering uncertain prices following some distributions. The buyer of a product attempts to minimize the sum of the inbound and outbound transportation costs, and the price charged by a chosen supplier. We characterize the optimal location of the distribution center. We also find that the buyer benefits from the price uncertainty, regardless of the location of the distribution center.</br>
