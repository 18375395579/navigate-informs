<br>Title: The Effect of Information on the Bidding and Survival of Entrants in Procurement Auctions</br><br>Author: Dakshina De Silva, Texas Tech University, Department of Economics, Lubbock, TX, 79409-1014, dakshina.de-silva@ttu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Kosmopoulou, Carlos Lamarche</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper examines the impact of a policy change by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation on the bidding patterns of entrants and incumbents, and the survival rates of entrants in highway procurement auctions. The Department of Transportation in Oklahoma, in April of 2000, started releasing along with the project plans, the state's internal estimate of the costs to complete highway construction projects. We found that entrants bid more aggressively and won auctions with significantly lower bids than incumbents before April 2000 but the bidding differential decreased substantially since then. The discrepancy in their bidding patterns can be attributed to informational and cost asymmetries between entrants and incumbents. The reduction in informational asymmetries, induced by the policy change, weakened the stochastic dominance relation between the bidding distributions of the two groups at the lower end. We also found that, entrants continue bidding for an exte nded period of time after the policy change, suggesting higher survival rates in the procurement auctions.</br>
