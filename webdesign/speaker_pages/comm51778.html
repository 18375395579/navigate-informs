Each arriving customer will purchase a product immediately if the price is below his valuation. Otherwise, such a customer will wait a fixed number of time periods and purchase a product as soon as the price goes below his valuation. If price remains above his valuation, the customer will depart without making a purchase. We identify the structure of an optimal policy and discuss extensions.</br>
