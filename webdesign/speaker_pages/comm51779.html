Title: Salesforce Incentives in Revenue Management<br>Author: Ayse Kocabiyikoglu, Bilkent University, aysekoca@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Ioana Popescu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate a revenue management setting where capacity allocation decisions are delegated to an agent, incentivized on salary plus commission. We compare the agent's allocation decision with the firm optimum, and suggest how the firm can design salesforce incentives to better match objectives. We study the effect of agent's preferences, contract parameters and market forces on the agent’s decision.
