A high remanufacturing cost discourages remanufactures and thus eliminates future competition. A low remanufacturing cost, however, will result in high salvage values since remanufacturers will have an interest in acquiring the used products. This, in turn, creates additional value for the consumers of new products and therefore allows the monopolist to extract additional profits.</br>
