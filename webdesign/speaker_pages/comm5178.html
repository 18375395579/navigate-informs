Title: OEM Strategies on the Secondary Market<br>Author: Beril Toktay, Associate Professor, College of Management, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree Street, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States, Beril.Toktay@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Ferguson, Nektarios Oraiopoulos<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study a monopolist’s incentives to manipulate the secondary market through modifying the cost of remanufacturing. A high remanufacturing cost discourages remanufactures and thus eliminates future competition. A low remanufacturing cost, however, will result in high salvage values since remanufacturers will have an interest in acquiring the used products. This, in turn, creates additional value for the consumers of new products and therefore allows the monopolist to extract additional profits.
