Thomas McCormick<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the incentives for transshipment in a decentralized supply chain, where a monopoly manufacturer sells through competing retailers. We find when the wholesale price is endogenous, the manufacturer and retailers?incentives for transhipment depends on the transhipment price. When the transshipment decisions are also endogenous, transhipment may not happen, and whether the manufacturer and retailers benefit from transshipment depends on their control of transshipment decisions.
