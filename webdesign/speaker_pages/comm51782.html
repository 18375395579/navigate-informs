We find a threshold for the remanufacturing cost below which it is optimal to offer remanufactured products, and analyze its dependence on the consumer profile. This allows us to identify the conditions under which it is customer segmentation and not cost differences that drive the decision. The results are applicable to the evaluation of the common marketing practices of branding and generics.</br>
