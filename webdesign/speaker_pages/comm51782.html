Title: Impact of Consumer Behavior on the Profitability of Remanufactured Products<br>Author: Ana Muriel, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 160 Governors Drive, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, muriel@ecs.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yue Jin, Yihao Lu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate the profitability of remanufactured products for a monopoly firm in a single period. We find a threshold for the remanufacturing cost below which it is optimal to offer remanufactured products, and analyze its dependence on the consumer profile. This allows us to identify the conditions under which it is customer segmentation and not cost differences that drive the decision. The results are applicable to the evaluation of the common marketing practices of branding and generics.
