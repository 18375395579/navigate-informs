Title: The Role of Modular Upgradability as a Green Design Strategy<br>Author: Sezer Ulku, Georgetown University, su8@georgetown.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vishal Agrawal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the efficacy of modular upgradability as a design-for-environment strategy. By endogenizing a firm's development and introduction decisions and by considering a product's entire life cycle, we identify when modular upgradable architecture leads to lower environmental impact and is also more profitable for a firm.
