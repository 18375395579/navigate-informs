<br>Title: Strategic Stock-Outs with Social Learning</br><br>Author: Yiangos Papanastasiou, PhD candidate, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW14SA, United Kingdom</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicos Savva, Nitin Bakshi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a monopoly firm selling its product to customers holding uncertain, heterogeneous valuations. Limited availability induces customer self-selection, with high-valuation customers exerting effort to obtain the product first. We account for social learning and demonstrate that by inducing an early supply shortage, a firm can optimally control the information signal emitted from early reviews. Thereby, the firm can closely mimic dynamic pricing outcomes while charging a fixed price.</br>
