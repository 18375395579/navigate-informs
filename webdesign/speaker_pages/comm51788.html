Title: Management of Innovation in the Product and Technology Markets<br>Author: Sinan Erzurumlu, Assistant Professor, Babson College, 231 Forest Park, Babson Park, MA, 02457, United States of America, serzurumlu@babson.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karthik Ramachandran<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Firms in many technology intensive industries increasingly license innovations to potential competitors besides using them in their own products. Licensing not only creates an additional profit stream, but could also enhance the value of the innovator's own product. However, it also makes the licensee a potent competitor in the product market. In this paper, we develop a model to understand if, when and how a firm should share its innovation with a rival.
