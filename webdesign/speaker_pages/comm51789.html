Carey School of Business, Tempe, AZ, 85287-4706, United States, ryin@anderson.ucla.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yossi Aviv, Amit Pazgal, Christopher Tang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider two types of customer purchasing behavior (myopic and strategic) and two types of display formats (Display All and Display One) on a retailer’s pricing and ordering decisions and his expected profit.  We consider a Stackelberg game between the retailer and the customers as well as the competitive sub-game between customers.  The existence and uniqueness of a threshold type Nash equilibrium for the sub-game between customers are established.
