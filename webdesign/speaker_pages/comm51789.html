<br>Title: The Implications of Customer Purchasing Behavior and Display Formats</br><br>Author: Rui Yin, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, Department of Supply Chain Management, W. P. Carey School of Business, Tempe, AZ, 85287-4706, United States, ryin@anderson.ucla.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yossi Aviv, Amit Pazgal, Christopher Tang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider two types of customer purchasing behavior (myopic and strategic) and two types of display formats (Display All and Display One) on a retailer’s pricing and ordering decisions and his expected profit.  We consider a Stackelberg game between the retailer and the customers as well as the competitive sub-game between customers.  The existence and uniqueness of a threshold type Nash equilibrium for the sub-game between customers are established.</br>
