<br>Title: The Interaction of Technology Choice and Financial Risk Management</br><br>Author: Onur Boyabatli, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore, onur.boyabatli@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Beril Toktay</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the interaction between technology choice (flexible versus dedicated) and financial risk management decisions of a monopolistic firm in a single period. The firm is budget-constrained and the budget can be engineered by using forward contracts. Flexible technology has risk-pooling benefits but higher investment cost. We investigate the complementarity/substitutability between flexible technology and financial risk management as a part of integrated risk management portfolio.</br>
