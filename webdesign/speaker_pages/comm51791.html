Title: Frenemies: Price Competition between Codesharing Airlines<br>Author: Sandra Transchel, Kuehne Logistics University, Brooktorkai 20, Hamburg, 20457, Germany, sandra.transchel@the-klu.org<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Shumsky<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study two codesharing airlines that operate flight legs between the same origin and destination. The airlines are competing for customers but are also cooperating by selling tickets on each others?flights. We formulate a closed-loop dynamic game under which each airline dynamically adjusts the prices for its own as well as for the partner’s seats. We examine the effectiveness of various transfer fee schemes and the effects of those schemes on the airlines?pricing.
