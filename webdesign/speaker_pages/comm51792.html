Title: The Provision and Impact of Trade Credit in Imbalanced Supply Chains: An Empirical Study<br>Author: Jianer Zhou, Assistant Professor, Boston College, Fulton Hall 454C, 140 Commonwealth Ave., Chestnut Hill, MA, 02467, United States of America, jianer.zhou@bc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hsiao-Hui Lee<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Using a large dataset that links non-service U.S. suppliers with their major customers, we show trade credit to be a collaborative and competitive tool in supply chains. While suppliers with smaller market share extend more trade credit to be competitive, suppliers with weaker bargaining power extend less to mitigate financing risk. When offered at the industry-average level, trade credit increases suppliers?sales, but when offered more aggressively, it reduces the entire supply chain sales.
