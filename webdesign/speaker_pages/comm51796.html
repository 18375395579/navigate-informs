Title: Integrated Options and Spot Procurement for Commodity Processors<br>Author: Fehmi Tanrisever, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, 5612, Netherlands, f.tanrisever@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Ankur Goel<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We show that under the value maximization framework and the assumption of perfect and efficient financial markets, options are more useful to mitigate demand risk than the price risk in the presence of logistical costs. We also identify conditions under which the options contracts are more valuable than the forward contracts for the firm.
