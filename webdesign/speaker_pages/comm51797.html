Title: A Study of Bidding Behavior in All-pay Auctions<br>Author: Peter Popkowski Leszczyc, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, ppopkows@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Ernan Haruvy<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In a field study, we investigate bidding strategies and revenue implications in simultaneous paired identical products auctions for winner-pay and all-pay formats in charity and non-charity settings. We find evidence that bidders in all-pay auctions use rational bidding strategies that are effective in these settings such as early jump bidding and late incremental bidding.  However, the all-pay format generated substantially higher revenue, in particular in a charity setting.
