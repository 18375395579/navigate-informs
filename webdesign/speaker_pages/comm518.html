<br>Title: Fixed and Market Pricing for Cloud Services</br><br>Author: Ian Kash, Microsoft Research, 7 J J Thomson Ave, Cambridge, CB3 0FB, United Kingdom, iankash@microsoft.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vineet Abhishek, Peter Key</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers two simple pricing schemes  for selling cloud instances and studies the trade-off between  them. We characterize the equilibrium for the hybrid system  where arriving jobs can choose between fixed or the market  based pricing. We provide theoretical and simulation based  evidence suggesting that fixed price generates a higher expected  revenue than the hybrid system.</br>
