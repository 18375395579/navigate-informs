Title: To Repair or to Replace?  Optimal Repair Durations for Short Lifecycle Products<br>Author: Kristin Sahyouni, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Department of IEMS, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, kristin@iems.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Canan Savaskan, Mark Daskin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a repair operation in which defective warranty items arrive to an OEM over a known period and must be repaired using spare parts procured from a third party supplier or replaced with a comparable next generation alternative.  We show how facility costs, inventory holding costs, replacement costs, and variable repair costs affect a firm’s optimal decision.  Extensions consider arrival rate uncertainty, supplier contracting options, and the value of information over the lifecycle.
