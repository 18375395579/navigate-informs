However, a time-inconsistency problem arises if (i) Strategic consumers if the future versions of the product design would continue to be modular, or (ii) Strategic suppliers of stable subsystems seek to appropriate gains from product improvement. We formalize this two-pronged design inconsistency problem and offer an integrated product-design and module-pricing based solution.</br>
