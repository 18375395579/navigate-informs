Title: Procurement Auctions with Error-prone RFQs<br>Author: Yan Yin, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, yinyan@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Damian Beil, Hyun-Soo Ahn<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many requests for quotes (RFQs) contain errors that will trigger re-design (and windfall supplier profits) after production has begun. We study how the buyer’s payment changes in the error rate, supplier’s design knowledge, and competition intensity. Surprisingly, we find that a higher error rate can sometimes decrease the buyer’s total payment by mitigating supplier windfall profits. We also show pre-paying re-design costs can be an alternative strategy to stem windfall profits.
