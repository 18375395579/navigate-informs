Extending a classic 2-period durable goods framework, we analyze the impact of take back costs on a firm’s product durability choice.  We show that compared to selling, leasing provides an incentive to raise durability, and that it is possible for the optimal durability to decrease if take backs increase.  Leasing implies higher durability and profit, yet we find selling yields higher surplus in some settings.</br>
