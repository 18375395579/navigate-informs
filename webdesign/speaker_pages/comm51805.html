Title: Dynamic Revenue Maximization: A Continuous Time Approach<br>Author: Philipp Strack, Department of Economics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany, philipp.strack@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Dirk Bergemann<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We characterize the profit-maximizing mechanism for repeatedly selling a non-durable good in continuous time.  The valuation of each agent is private information and changes over time. At the time of contracting every agent privately observes his initial type which influences the evolution of his valuation process. In the profit-maximizing mechanism the allocation is distorted in favor of agents with high initial types.
