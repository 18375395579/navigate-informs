We optimize the type and amount of flexibility using a Brownian approximation that is asymptotically correct. We show analytically that for most practical flexibility cost structures the optimal flexibility configuration invests a lot in dedicated resources, a little in bi-level flexibility, but nothing in level-k>2 flexibility, let alone full flexibility.</br>
