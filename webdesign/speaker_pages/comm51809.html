Title: Energy Cost Aware Pricing and Resource Management in Cloud<br>Author: Parijat Dube, IBM, TJ Watson Research Center, Hawthorne, NY, United States of America, pdube@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Munish Goyal<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a competitive model with M application providers each demanding certain slice of resources from the cloud. They obtain base resource slice on long term lease whereas configurable peak resource slice can be purchased on spot. Cloud auctions residual resource capacity at regularly space time intervals thus offering an opportunity for the application owners to monitor application workload and modulate the resource slice dynamically to balance service quality and energy cost.
