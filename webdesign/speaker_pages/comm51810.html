<br>Title: Strategic Customer Behavior: Forward versus Backward Intertemporal Substitution</br><br>Author: Xuanming Su, University of California, Haas School of Business, Berkeley, 94720, United States, xuanming@haas.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Intertemporal substitution allows the strategic consumer to shift demand and avoid high prices.  Previous work has considered how consumers may strategically postpone purchases and wait for sales (forward substitution).  Here, we consider the reverse case where consumers take advantage of periodic promotions by stockpiling for future consumption (backward substitution), and we analyze the optimal dynamic pricing policy.</br>
