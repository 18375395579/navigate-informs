Under Rank feedback, bidders see only their current bid ranking. Via experiments, we test the theoretical prediction of rank and full feedback when bidders have asymmetric quality and costs. We find that rank feedback, combined with uniform reserve prices, sometimes induces bidders to behave equivalently to a sealed-bid format.</br>
