Our objective here is to investigate non-operational levers for outsourcing. Using a bargaining model under duopoly we show that if the products are sufficiently substitutable, it is a dominant strategy for both firms to outsource only if the supplier has a higher cost of production. We also characterize the impact of the outsourcing decisions on the level of innovation in the outsourcing firms.</br>
