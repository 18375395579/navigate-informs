Title: Strategic Rationale for Outsourcing<br>Author: Sarang Deo, Kellogg School of Management, 596 Leverone, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, s-deo@northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pradeep Bhardwaj<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Outsourcing decision is usually justified on the basis of operational levers such as cost-reduction. Our objective here is to investigate non-operational levers for outsourcing. Using a bargaining model under duopoly we show that if the products are sufficiently substitutable, it is a dominant strategy for both firms to outsource only if the supplier has a higher cost of production. We also characterize the impact of the outsourcing decisions on the level of innovation in the outsourcing firms.
