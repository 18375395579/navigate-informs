Title: Investigating why Brand Drugs do not Lower their Price in the Face of Generic Competition<br>Author: Kathleen Iacocca, University of Scranton, 439 Brennan Hall, University of Scranton, Scranton, PA, 18510, United States of America, kathleen.iacocca@scranton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yao Zhao, James Sawhill<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper investigates why brand-name drugs are priced higher than their generic equivalents.   We hypothesize that some consumers have a preference for brand names which outweighs the cost savings realized by switching to generics. We develop a structural demand model and proceed to estimate it using wholesale price and demand data. Applying the model to the pharmaceutical industry, we generate managerial insights by showing how changes in prices impact market share.
