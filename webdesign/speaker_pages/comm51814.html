<br>Title: Price of Anarchy in Quadratic Utility Games</br><br>Author: Georgia Perakis, Associate Professor, Sloan School, MIT, 50 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, georgiap@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Kluberg</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study quadratic utility games (for example, Cournot, i.e. quantity competition) with linear demand price relation. We present a bound on the price of anarchy (ie. comparison of system profit between centralized and decentralized settings) that depends on the number of players and the maximum market power of the players. The bound is independent of the constraints of the game and hence allows multiperiod competition with fixed capacities over the time horizon as a special case.</br>
