Title: On the Performance Of Supply Chain Contracts With Domestic Gray Market Externalities<br>Author: Mehmet Sekip Altug, Assistant Professor, George Washington University, 2201 G. Street NW, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, maltug@gwu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain with one manufacturer and several authorized distributors that face uncertain demand and the potential of a domestic gray market emergence, which is possibly fed by local authorized distributors as a result of the incentives manufacturer provides. We characterize the emerging equilibrium in such domestic gray markets. We find out that wholesale pricing is quite robust to the presence of domestic gray markets so much so that manufacturers can even be better off.
