In the first stage, a firm makes optimal staffing decision according to estimated demand and workforce flexibility. In the second stage, it reallocates its workforce to react to demand shocks. Our numerical results show that flexibility can lead a firm to staff with too little slack to be flexible to demand shocks, thus leading to higher total costs i.e., staffing and inventory costs.</br>
