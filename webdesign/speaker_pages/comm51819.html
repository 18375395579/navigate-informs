Title: Does It Pay Off to Bid Aggressively? An Empirical Study<br>Author: Philipp Herrmann, University of Paderborn, Warburger Straﬂe 100, Paderborn, Germany, Philipp.Herrmann@wiwi.uni-paderborn.de<br>Coauthor(s): Mohammad Rahman, Dennis Kundisch<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We empirically investigate the payoff of aggressive bidding in an electronic auction. We use a unique and very rich dataset containing actual market transaction data for approximately 7,000 pay-per-bid auctions. Our research design allows us to separate the effect of an aggressive bidding strategy to signal oneís own valuation from the effect of bidding aggressively due to impatience. We find a strong and significantly negative effect of aggressive bidding on the likelihood to win an auction.
