Title: Auctions for Deliberative Agents<br>Author: David Thompson, University of British Columbia, 201-2366 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada, daveth@cs.ubc.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Leyton-Brown<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In auctions, agents might not know their exact valuations because of  transaction costs or bounded rationality.  We show settings where if  agents don't coordinate value discovery, it can affect efficiency and  revenue.  For sealed-bid auctions, we show revenue and  value-of-information bounds and where revenue equivalence applies.
