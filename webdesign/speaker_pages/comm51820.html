Title: Capacity-expandable Product Design for a Competitive Downstream Market<br>Author: Yue Jin, Researcher, Member of Technical Staff, Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, Ireland, Blanchardstown Industrial Park, Blanchardstown, Dublin, IR, 15, Ireland, yuejin@alcatel-lucent.com<br>Coauthor(s): Qiong Wang, Ulas Ozen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a two-tier market where an upstream monopoly sells a capacity-expandable product through a two-part tariff. Buyers are competitive downstream firms whose demands are uncertain. The manufacturer chooses between a software-enabled design (SED) with high upfront cost, low incremental cost, and a strict capacity limit, and a hardware-enabled design with the opposite cost structure and no capacity limit. We demonstrate that SED can improve vendor’s expected profit with a reduced risk.
