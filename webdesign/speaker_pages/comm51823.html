We assume a Bass-type diffusion process for the demand. The manufacturer decides on whether to launch the IDP through a direct, an indirect or a competitive channel. We characterize the impact of after-sales profits and the retailer market influences on the pricing decisions of the channel members as well as the manufacturer’s decisions on channel configuration.
