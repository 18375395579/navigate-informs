Title: Making Better Replenishment Decisions in Online Retail<br>Author: Jason Acimovic, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State Smeal College of Business, 5 Carlisle St, Unit 3, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, acimovic@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Graves<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Online retailers operate multiple warehouses with centralized order fulfillment and inventory management.  When an individual warehouse stocks out, demand spills over to another warehouse.  We show the pitfalls of the local base-stock policy ?popular in practice.  This kind of replenishment policy can lead to undesirable dynamics and high outbound shipping costs.  We show evidence on data from a large online retailer.  We propose a new replenishment policy that performs better.
