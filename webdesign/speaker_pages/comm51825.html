Our Peak Policy for buying consumable parts reduces wholesale delay 20 to 50% for a given inventory investment. We now extend Peak Policy to reparable items with sporadic demand. We discuss the challenges, show how we adapted the Peak Policy to improve support for these items, and conclude with management insights. Peak Policy is a trademark of LMI.</br>
