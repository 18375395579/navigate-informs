<br>Title: Preemption and Jump Bidding</br><br>Author: Vladimir Mares, Assistant Professor, Olin School of Business, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO, 63105, United States of America, MARES@WUSTL.EDU</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper constructs an integrated model of preemption and joint bidding in open auctions. The decision to discretely increase the price is endogenous and relies purely managing the flow of information among a bidder's competitors.In doing so they affect both the expected price and the allocation of the asset. Increased competition can actually strengthen these incentives. The paper characterizes optimal bidding plans and derives comparative statics.</br>
