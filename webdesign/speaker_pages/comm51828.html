Title: Bounded Rationality in Newsvendor Models<br>Author: Xuanming Su, University of California, Haas School of Business, Berkeley, 94720, United States, xuanming@haas.berkeley.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We propose a decision framework of bounded rationality. While the best decision need not always be made, better decisions are made more often. We identify systematic over-ording and under-ordering biases, and we analyze a data-set of newsvendor-type decisions made by individual subjects in a laboratory setting.  We also investigate the impact of these biases on other inventory settings, such as supply chain contracting, the bullwhip effect, and inventory pooling.
