Title: Dynamic Spectrum Allocation for Cognitive Radio<br>Author: Richard La, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, A. V. Williams Bldg.

Primary users can re-sell a portion of purchased spectrum when it is underutilized to recover parts of their cost. Interested primary users can cooperate among themselves to auction away available spectrum to secondary users that are assumed selfish. We investigate if there is an incentive for the primary users (sellers) to cooperate to increase their expected revenue.
