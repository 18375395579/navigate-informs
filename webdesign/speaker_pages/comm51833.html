Title: The Value of Flexibility in New Product Development: The Impact of Competition<br>Author: Janne Kettunen, London Business School, Regents Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, jkettunen@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yael Grushka-Cockayne, Bert De Reyck, Ahti Salo, Zeger Degraeve<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine the effect of competition on the value of the flexibilities in new product development accounting for market type and uncertainties in the development process. We develop a multi-stage stochastic optimization model and show that an increase in competition may increase or decrease the value of the flexibilities, delaying product launch is highly valuable in a low competition environment, and flexibilities have greater value in a winner-takes-all market than in a shared market.
