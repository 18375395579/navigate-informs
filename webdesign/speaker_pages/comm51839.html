Title: Flexible Products for Dynamic Preferences<br>Author: Aydin Alptekinoglu, SMU Cox School of Business, 6212 Bishop Blvd, Dallas, TX, 75205, United States of America, aalp@cox.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karthik Ramachandran<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We address a product design dilemma in the face of dynamic consumer preferences that change randomly over time. Is it better from a firm’s perspective to offer multiple standard products (a set of dumbbells each with a specific weight) or one flexible product (a weight-adjustable dumbbell)? We find that higher ideal-product utility, more stable consumer preferences, and reduced durability all favor flexible products.
