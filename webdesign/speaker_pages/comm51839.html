Is it better from a firm’s perspective to offer multiple standard products (a set of dumbbells each with a specific weight) or one flexible product (a weight-adjustable dumbbell)? We find that higher ideal-product utility, more stable consumer preferences, and reduced durability all favor flexible products.</br>
