<br>Title: Managing Backlog and Capacity Flexibility in an Assemble-to-Order Production Environment</br><br>Author: Douglas Morrice, Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, IROM Department, McCombs School of Business, 1 University Station B6500, Austin, TX, 78712-0212, United States, Douglas.Morrice@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fehmi Tanrisever, David Morton</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a multi-period planning problem in an assemble-to-order production environment in which multiple product families can be produced on multiple production lines. Given the demand distribution, assignment decisions are made in the first period. In subsequent periods as demand is realized it is allocated to production lines in order to minimze backlog.</br>
