Along with national shortages, it causes lack of medicines leading to patients suffering. In this study, a continuous time Markov chain is considered to find the optimal inventory policy for a healthcare facility under supply and demand uncertainty. Simulation results show increase in availability of drugs and reduction in costs.</br>
