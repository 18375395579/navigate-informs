Title: Performance-based Contract Design for Software Outsourcing<br>Author: Ming Fan, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, Foster School of Business, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, mfan@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Debabrata Dey<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a contract-theoretic model to examine how optimal software outsourcing contracts can be designed. We tie contract payment with the software performance and find a first-best solution can be reached with the performance-based contract. We extend this contract to a two period setting and derive conditions that the client prefers staged development. We also analyze profit-sharing contracts which are useful in situations where the software developer has more market power.
