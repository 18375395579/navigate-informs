Title: Revenue Management and Pricing for Freight Transport  in Indian Railways<br>Author: G Raghuram, Professor, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, Wing 15, IIMA Campus, IIMA Campus, Ahmedabad, 380015, India, graghu@iimahd.ernet.in<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The pricing policy for freight transport in Indian Railways demonstrates a recognition of where it is monopolistically placed, and competing with other modes. This policy is a departure from the earlier one which considered the impact of rail transport cost on the final price of the commodity. There are also a variety of discounts and surcharges depending on the traffic flows. This paper brings out the implication of the pricing policy, organizational processes behind the same and a way forward.
