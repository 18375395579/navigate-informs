<br>Title: Bidding Strategies In Buyer-Determined Online Reverse Auctions</br><br>Author: Sandy Jap, Caldwell Research Fellow, Goizueta Business School, Emory University, Sandy_Jap@bus.emory.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sherry Li</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The growing use of business-to-business online reverse auctions has produced a new type of auction, one in which the lowest price bidder is not necessarily guaranteed to be the winner and the buyer has full latitude to select the winner from any of the qualified bidders.  What are the strategies of bidders in these types of auctions?  We find that in these auctions, bidders do not follow the typical bidding strategy of private value English auctions ?to outbid the competition down to one’s reservation price ?but instead respond to their perceptions of competitors?quality and rely on their known quality variables, such as certifications and past relationships in formulating their bids.  Using a hierarchical bounded rationality framework and point-by-point bid data from two industrial reverse auctions, we find that bidders incorporate quality information from competitive bids over the course of the auction; that is, suppliers not only adjust their bids for their own quality-advantage or disadvantage ?they also account for opponents?perceived quality differences.  We also find that bidders will bid more aggressively as the economic stakes, or number of lots, in an auction increases and that although incumbents tend to bid aggressively, this behavior is moderated by their relationship state with the buyer (i.e., the level of trust, willingness to collaborate, and general relationship trend).  Implications for the management of online reverse auctions are discussed.</br>
