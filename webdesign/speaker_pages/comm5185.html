Title: Supply Diagnostic Incentives in New Product Development<br>Author: Mehmet Gumus, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, mehmet.gumus@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mohammad Nikoofal<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In launching new products, the newness of the production leads to unexpected reliability issues on supply side. The adverse effect of supply risk can be mitigated via test production. We explore how such a diagnostic technology investment may affect both incentive and information asymmetries across channel partners.
