Title: Customer Response to Short-Term Price Fluctuations<br>Author: Margaret Pierson, Assistant Professor, Tuck at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States of America, mpierson@hbs.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Transactions at 15 gasoline stations in Massachusetts over two years are used to estimate consumer elasticity with respect to price on a transaction basis.  A significant proportion of the observed transactions display high sensitivity to price.  This customer behavior results in congestion at pumps during high prices, a counterintuitive result which constrains stations' price choices in practice.
