Assets also include contracts to hedge the risk from uncertainties in material production and distribution. Optimal asset management (AM) involves investing and disinvesting in assets, leading to supply chain redesign (SCR), such that the NPV of the shareholder value is maximized. We present here a novel MILP model for SCR&AM.
