<br>Title: Inefficiency in Forward Markets with Supply Friction</br><br>Author: Wuhan Desmond Cai, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E. California Blvd., MC 305-16, Pasadena, CA, United States of America, wccai@caltech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Adam Wierman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study an oligopolistic two-settlement market comprising two types of power producers (baseloads and peakers). To model the fact that peakers can ramp up more rapidly than baseloads, we assume that baseloads must choose production levels ahead of peakers. We show that, when the system is capacity-constrained, there may not exist equilibria in which baseloads and peakers play symmetric strategies. We also show connections between our model and the classical Stackelberg game.</br>
