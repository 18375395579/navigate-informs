Title: Supply Chain Contract Design: Impact of Bounded Rationality and Individual Heterogeneity<br>Author: Kay-Yut Chen, Hewlett-Packard, 3000 Hanover St, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, United States of America, kay-yut.chen@hp.com<br>Coauthor(s): Diana Wu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we model several forms of non-optimizing behavior, including recency effect, reinforcement, demand-chasing and anchoring and random decision errors, in a newsvendor setting under different types of supply chain contracts. A great deal of heterogeneity is discovered, indicating the importance of calibrating contract to the individual. In addition, our analysis shows that the profitability and the effectiveness of contracts can be affected by non-optimizing behaviors significantly.
