Retailer has two demands - new customers and old customers who exercise the warranty. The warranty demand has the first priority to be satisfied, and retailer must guarantee a full satisfaction. Hence, it reduces retailer's capability to meet new demand and even incurs an additional cost. We consider three uncertainties ¨C new demand, warranty exercise ratio, and fraction of customers who buy warranty.</br>
