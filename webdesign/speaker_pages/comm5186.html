Title: Inventory Substitution Model with Competition<br>Author: Raj Rajagopalan, Professor, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, srajagop@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mahesh Nagarajan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We look at a duopoly model where two newsvendors selling substitutable products with negatively correlated demand compete by setting inventory levels. We consider both static and dynamic versions of this game and show some interesting properties of the equilibrium inventory policy. In particular, we specify conditions when players may ignore their competitor’s inventory levels and potential substitution demand.
