Title: Contracting for On-Time Delivery in the US Influenza Vaccine Supply Chain<br>Author: Soo-Haeng Cho, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, soohaeng@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tinglong Dai, Fuqiang Zhang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Motivated by the flu vaccine industry, we consider a supply chain that involves three sources of uncertainties: design, delivery, and demand. In such a supply chain it is critical for the firms to choose the right production quantity at the right time. It is shown that several well-known contracts fail to coordinate the supply chain. So we propose new coordinating contracts that are reported in practice but not studied in the extant literature.
