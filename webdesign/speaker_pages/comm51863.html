<br>Title: Product (Mis)Fit Information and Strategic Channel Decisions in Store Brand Context</br><br>Author: Arcan Nalca, Queen's School of Business, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, arcan.nalca@business.queensu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tamer Boyaci, Saibal Ray</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the dynamics of national brand and store brand introductions, and its implications on the trading decisions involving prices and orders within a manufacturer-retailer channel. In our setting, a new national brand product is launched when there is still ex-ante uncertainty about consumer tastes, and the retailer learns about the desired product characteristics while selling this product. We investigate the optimal retail strategy to capitalize on this temporarily distinct information.</br>
