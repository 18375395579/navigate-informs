Title: Distribution Center Location and Inventory Allocation under Explicit Transportation Costs<br>Coauthor(s): Burcu B. Keskin, Halit Uster, Sila Cetinkaya<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a single-supplier that serves multiple retailers in geographically dispersed locations. In order to benefit from economies of scale in transportation, the supplier is interested in operating a central distribution center. We develop analytical models for quantifying the impact of the location of the central distribution center on inventory allocation and payoffs of all the parties under explicit transportation costs.
