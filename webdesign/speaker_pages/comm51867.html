Title: Information-sensitive Inventory Management When Records Are Inaccurate<br>Author: Adam Mersereau, Assistant Professor, Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina, Campus Box 3490, McColl Bldg., Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-3490, United States, amersere@chicagogsb.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider replenishment policies in a lost sales inventory system with imperfect inventory records, where the decision-maker maintains a Bayesian record of her inventory position.  We formulate the replenishment problem as a partially observed Markov decision process, and we compare single-period to forward-looking policies.  We show the impact of data uncertainty on optimal replenishment.  We also develop  approximations for making near-optimal replenishment decisions.
