Title: Valuing Adaptive Quality and Shutdown Options in Production Systems<br>Author: Danko Turcic, Assistant Professor of Operations, Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, 1 Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO, 63130-4899, United States of America, danko.turcic@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Peter Ritchken<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider two forms of operational flexibility in a production setting: the option to shut down production temporarily, and the option to control expected production yield through effort. The absolute values of both options are sensitive to costs and prices of finished goods, and they increase with price uncertainty. Their relative contribution to the value of production technology may increase or decrease as price uncertainty increases; sufficient conditions are provided for both.
