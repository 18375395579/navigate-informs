Title: Design and Pricing of Derivative Contracts in a Spectrum Market<br>Author: Aparna Gupta, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 Eight Street, Troy, NY, United States of America, guptaa@rpi.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Koushik Kar, Praveen Kumar<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We design and price derivative contracts on spectrum for managing risks caused by uncertainties in spot prices of spectrum licenses. A secondary spectrum market allows wireless providers to purchase spectrum access licenses of short duration using spot contracts and derivative contracts on spectrum. A spot contract provides immediate access, while derivative contracts involve purchase of spectrum licenses in the future for predefined terms, thus playing important role in risk management.
