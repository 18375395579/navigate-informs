A secondary spectrum market allows wireless providers to purchase spectrum access licenses of short duration using spot contracts and derivative contracts on spectrum. A spot contract provides immediate access, while derivative contracts involve purchase of spectrum licenses in the future for predefined terms, thus playing important role in risk management.</br>
