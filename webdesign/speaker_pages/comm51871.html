Title: Nonlinear Optimization of Bank Deposit and Loan Prices<br>Author: Bruce Moore, Director of Business Intelligence, Credit Union of Texas, 8131 LBJ Freeway, Suite 550, Dallas, TX, 75251, United States of America, bmoore@cuoftexas.org<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Banks and other financial institutions set deposit and loan prices on a daily or weekly basis to maximize net income while limiting credit, interest rate and other risks.  We present a constrained nonlinear optimization model for setting deposit and loan prices and forecasting their respective volumes for a $1.2 billion financial institution.  The model incorporates constraints for deposit and loan price variability, price relationships between products, credit risk, and interest rate risk.
