We investigate how the nature of work, the extent of control exerted by buyers and suppliers of offshore services and the features of the contract all impact on the quality of work produced offshore.    Our research is based on a panel data set (a balanced panel of suppliers and buyers) from multiple countries and multiple buyers and suppliers of offshore services.</br>
