Title: Implications of Product Lifecycle and Channel Structure upon Optimal Investment in Durability<br>Author: Stephen Gilbert, Professor, University of Texas at Austin, IROM Department, McCombs School of Business, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Steve.Gilbert@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sreekumar Bhaskaran<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate how the use of intermediaries in the channel of distribution affects a manufacturer's investment in the durability of a product. Depending upon the product and technology life-cycles, the nature production technology and manufacturing costs, we find that a manufacturer can have an incentive to invest more in durability when he sells through intermediaries than when he sells directly.
