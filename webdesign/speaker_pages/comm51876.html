Title: When Newsvendors Herd: The Impact of Comparison on Ordering Decisions<br>Author: Buket Avci, Phd Student, INSEAD, Blvd de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, buket.avci@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steffen Keck, Zeina Loutfi, Kaifu Zhang, Elena Belavina<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a model of newsvendor type decision making when agents care not only about individual profit but also about the difference with another agent's profit. Agents alter their decision in order to minimize expected regret versus what is viewed as foregone profit and to maximize corresponding expected rejoice.  In equilibrium this leads to herding behavior when regret dominates rejoice. We conduct experiments in order to evaluate the scope of this herding behavior in ordering decisions.
