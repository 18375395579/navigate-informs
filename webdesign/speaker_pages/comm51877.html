A two-part tariff scheme is used which consists on a down-payment (a fraction of the setup cost) and a periodic fee. We examine the monopoly and duopoly market scenarios, finding near optimal fixed-price policies, and that duopoly firms use the down-payment to protect themselves from the effect of customers switching.</br>
