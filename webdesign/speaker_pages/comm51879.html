Title: Disruption Management with Responsive Pricing and Contingent Capacity<br>Author: Sharethram Hariharan, Research Associate, Oklahoma State University, 322 EN OSU Stillwater Campus, Stillwater, OK, 74074, United States of America, sharethramh@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Tieming Liu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the capacity investment and disruption management decisions for a firm selling two products with responsive pricing and contingent capacity. The contingent capacity is available to produce a product when its capacity is insufficient. We formulate the problem as a stochastic programming model, study the impact of demand uncertainty (risk) on the optimal investment levels and characterize the structure of the optimal policy.
