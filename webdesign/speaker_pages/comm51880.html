<br>Title: Price-discovery vs. Profit-taking: The Market-maker's Exploration-exploitation Tradeoff</br><br>Author: Sanmay Das, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Dept. of Computer Science, 110 8th St, Troy, NY, 12180-3590, United States, sanmay@cs.rpi.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the profit-maximization problem of a monopolistic market-maker in a market model based on that of Glosten and Milgrom. I introduce an entropy-based algorithm for trading off exploration and exploitation that outperforms both myopic profit maximizing algorithms and previous heuristics. Surprisingly, price discovery is quicker than in a competitive model, because the market-maker is willing to absorb losses following a valuation shock to learn the new valuation more rapidly.</br>
