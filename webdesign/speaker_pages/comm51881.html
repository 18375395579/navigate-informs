O. Box 830688, Richardson, TX, 75080-0688, United States of America, metin@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): chao liang, Suresh Sethi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Innovation rate, orders, prices and profit are analyzed in four settings: myopic or strategic customers, and single or dual (product) rollover for product transitions.  With myopic customers, single rollover hurts the profit but accelerates the innovation process, and the innovation rate and profit cannot be increased simultaneously with any rollover strategy. With strategic customers, a firm can provide a more innovative product, earn a higher profit with the appropriate rollover strategy.
