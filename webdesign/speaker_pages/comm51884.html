Matthews Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, xinchen@illinois.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhan Pang, Limeng Pan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We analyze the joint pricing and inventory control problem of a perishable product with a fixed lifetime and price-dependent demand over a finite horizon. The objective is to find a joint pricing, ordering, and disposal policy so as to maximize the total expected discounted profit over the planning horizon taking into account linear ordering cost, inventory holding and backlogging or lost-sales penalty cost and disposal cost.
