Title: Advance Selling with Asymmetric Information on Quality<br>Author: Hyun-Soo Ahn, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, 48104, United States, hsahn@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Roman Kapuscinski, Man Yu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a monopolistic seller whose product can be sold both in advance and at the time of consumption.  The quality of the product is a private knowledge of the seller. The seller needs to decide whether to sell in advance, how much to offer, and at what price. We show how the buyers?beliefs on product quality, as well as, limited capacity influence the seller’s optimal pricing and rationing policy.
