Title: Startegic Consumer Impact on Bankruptcy and Competition<br>Author: John Birge, Professor, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America, john.birge@chicagobooth.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rodney Parker, Song Alex Yang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In a previous model of firm competition under the threat of one firm's  bankruptcy, we showed how that firm could use bankruptcy strategically to gain concessions from a dominant supplier.  In this work, we consider the effect on the supply chain from consumers who anticipate future price discounts in the event of a bankruptcy.
