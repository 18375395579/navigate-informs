Lee</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a duopoly in which two competing firms choose whether to adopt socially responsible manufacturing practices. Doing so attracts demand from competing firms-those consumers who have a preference for socially responsible production-but also increases costs. We consider the impact of supply chain structure on the firms?decisions, and discuss how the supplier and consumer population characteristics combine to influence the equilibrium degree of social responsibility in the industry.</br>
