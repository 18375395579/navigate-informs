The firm produces two substitutable products and can invest in product-dedicated resources as well as a more expensive, flexible resource. We consider both monopoly and duopoly markets and characterize the structure of the optimal investment decision in both cases. We also investigate the benefits of flexible capacity under various situations and derive managerial insights.</br>
