Title: Optimal Pricing in the Presence of Social Learning and Forward-Looking Consumers<br>Author: Yiangos Papanastasiou, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, United Kingdom, yiangosp.phd2010@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nicos Savva<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: When a new product of uncertain quality is introduced to the market, consumers may choose to delay their purchasing decision in anticipation of social learning from the reviews of early buyers. This paper studies the problem of optimal dynamic pricing when a monopolist operates in such an environment. We analyze and compare two types of pricing policies, pre-announced and contingent, and identify their implications for consumer surplus and firm profit.
