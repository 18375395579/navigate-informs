<br>Title: Honesty in Incomplete Supply Chain Contracts</br><br>Author: He Chen, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland College Park, 3330C Van Munching Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, hechen@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Krishnan S Anand, Manu Goyal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Incomplete contracts are vulnerable to ex-post opportunistic behaviors. In an evolving (multi-period) relationship between a manufacturer and his supplier, we prove that an honest manufacturer can outperform an opportunistic manufacturer, even though the opportunistic manufacturer’s strategy space includes mimicking the honest manufacturer. Thus, honesty emerges endogenously as the optimal policy.</br>
