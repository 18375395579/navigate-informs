<br>Title: Leadtime-variety Tradeoff in Product Differentiation</br><br>Author: Aydin Alptekinoglu, Assistant Professor, University of Florida, 358 Stuzin Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-7169, United States of America, aalp@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Charles Corbett</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Customers generally prefer products to be delivered sooner rather than later, and they prefer products that are closer to their ideal specifications. However, firms have to make a choice between offering a more limited product line that is available immediately from stock or a broader product line that is only available to order, hence at a delay. To some degree firms can use inventory or capacity to mitigate this tradeoff, but they cannot eliminate it as Squire et al. (2006) show empirically.</br>
