The major questions we address are: how much production quantity should the supplier prepare for the selling season? How much inventory should the retailer order? What supply chain contract or partnership should the supplier and retailer engage in to induce the most efficient decisions of the supplier and the retailer? We investigate the equilibrium under a variety of partnerships.</br>
