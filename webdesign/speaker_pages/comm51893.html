Title: Supply Chain Partnerships with both Uncertain Demand and Supply<br>Author: Xuan Zhao, Associate Professor, Wilfrid Laurier University, 75 University Ave. W., Waterloo, On, N2J 3C5, Canada, xzhao@wlu.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Yong He<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider an agriculture supply chain with an uncertain supplier selling to a retailer facing stochastic demand. The major questions we address are: how much production quantity should the supplier prepare for the selling season? How much inventory should the retailer order? What supply chain contract or partnership should the supplier and retailer engage in to induce the most efficient decisions of the supplier and the retailer? We investigate the equilibrium under a variety of partnerships.
