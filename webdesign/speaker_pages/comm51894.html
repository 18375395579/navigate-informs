<br>Title: Forward Markets in Electricity, Do They Increase Total Supply?</br><br>Author: Fred Murphy, Professor, Temple University, The Fox School of Business, 108 Speakman Hall, 1810 N. 13th Street, Philadlephia, PA, 19122, United States, fmurphy@temple.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yves Smeers</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Allaz and Vila proved that adding a futures market leads to an increase in production. They model a two-stage game with futures positions taken before spot decisions. This work has led to belief that a futures market can reduce market power in electricity markets. With a third stage added to the game, prior to futures positions, production can either increase or decrease and a futures market can lead to multiple equilibria. Thus, a futures market is no panacea for a lack of competition.</br>
