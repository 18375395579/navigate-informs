<br>Title: The Structure and Sensitivity of Dynamic Pricing and Replenishment Policies in a Production System</br><br>Author: Lerzan Ormeci, Koc University, Rumelifeneri Yolu, Sariyer, Istanbul, TR, 34450, Turkey, lormeci@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Gayon, Isilay Degirmenci, Fikri Karaesmen, Eren Basar Cil</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A production system which controls both pricing and replenishment dynamically is modeled as a make-to-stock queue. The potential demand is generated by a Markov-modulated Poisson process, where the actual demand depends on the offered price. We obtain results on the structure of the optimal replenishment and pricing policies. The effects of dynamic and static pricing are compared in a numerical study. The sensitivity of the optimal policies with respect to certain parameters is also explored.</br>
