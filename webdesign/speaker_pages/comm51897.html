The leader tries to maximize its revenues and minimize the environmental damage caused by the mining company. The sole objective of the follower is to maximize its profit under the limitations set by the leader. We formulate the model and solve it using evolutionary algorithms to determine the optimal decisions over multiple periods for the leader and the follower.</br>
