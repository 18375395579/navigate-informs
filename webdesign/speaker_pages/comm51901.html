However, all contracts tested in a lab so far share one property: they do not work as the theory predicts. Our model incorporates fairness as one of the driving factors treating it as private information. Among other results, we characterize the supplier’s optimal profit-maximizing contract. Testing the model in an experiment we find that it works where the standard theory fails.</br>
