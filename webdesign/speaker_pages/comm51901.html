Title: Contracting with a Fair-minded Retailer<br>Author: Valery Pavlov, PhD Candidate, Pennsylavania State University, 463A Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, vup112@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elena Katok<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Extant literature proposes a great variety of contracts that are supposed to coordinate a supplier-retailer channel. However, all contracts tested in a lab so far share one property: they do not work as the theory predicts. Our model incorporates fairness as one of the driving factors treating it as private information. Among other results, we characterize the supplier’s optimal profit-maximizing contract. Testing the model in an experiment we find that it works where the standard theory fails.
