The time series approach is based on the auto-regressive moving average frame, and the seasonality and trend hidden in the price data are captured by the seasonality and trend terms (or functions), respectively. The suggested model has the good generalization structure and is shown to have the potential application value for the price forecast of perishable products.</br>
