Title: Control, Capability and Cost in Outsourcing<br>Author: Cheryl Druehl, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, United States of America, cdruehl@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gal Raz<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the impact of control (decision rights on design/process innovation effort), capability (who is better at innovation), and innovation cost on outcomes. We consider outsourcing manufacturing/process innovation or outsourcing design/process innovation/manufacturing. With wholesale price contracts, the buyer never outsources both design/manufacturing. With a two-part tariff, the buyer outsources both design/manufacturing if the supplier is better in one factor and equal in the other two.
