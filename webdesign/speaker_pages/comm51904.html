<br>Title: Inventory and Process Flexibility in a Make-to-stock System with Product Substitution</br><br>Author: Bora Kolfal, University of Alberta, 4-20K Business Building, Edmonton, AB, Canada, Bora.Kolfal@ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Van Oyen, Seyed Iravani</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the joint production-inventory control problem of a firm producing two substitutable products in a make-to-stock system. We prove the structure of the joint optimal production and substitution policy for the equal production rate case. We construct a multi-threshold policy as a substitute for the optimal policy for the general case. Our numerical study provides insights into the interaction and comparison of process flexibility and inventory flexibility.</br>
