Title: Forward Buying in Competitive Market<br>Author: Oded Koenigsberg, Columbia University, ok2018@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Devavrat Purohit, Preyas Desai<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Forward buying is a practice in which retailers purchase units during a particular period, hold these units in inventory and then sell them in subsequent periods.  Retailer forward buying tends to be correlated with trade promotions which (the consensus views are) from a theoretical standpoint persist because of the intense competition. In this research we study the effect of competition either in the manufacturer or the retailer levels on the forward buying decision.
