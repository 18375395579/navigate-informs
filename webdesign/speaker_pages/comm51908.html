<br>Title: Coordinated Production Strategies for Outsourced Operations</br><br>Author: Tolga Aydinliyim, Assistant Professor, University of Oregon, Lundquist College of Business, Decision Sciences Department, Eugene, OR, 97403, United States of America, tolga@lcbmail.uoregon.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Vairaktarakis</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a model where multiple manufacturers outsource to the same third-party with specialized resources. Such business transactions are increasingly handled online where third-party’s available capacity is announced to the manufacturers. As opposed to the current practice of the FCFS booking of the third-party capacity, centralized control generates significant savings, but result to inferior performance individually. We present savings sharing schemes that promote centralization.</br>
