Title: Integrated Options and Spot Procurement for Commodity Processors<br>Author: Ankur Goel, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States of America, axg312@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fehmi Tanrisever<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a firm that procures a commodity through a combination of options and spot contracts to process it and then distribute it to the downstream retailers to satisfy random demand. We identify conditions under which the options contracts are more valuable than the forward contracts for the firm. We show that the value of procurement through options contract increases with demand volatility and decreases with price volatility.
