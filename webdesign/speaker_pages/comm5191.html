Title: Information Sharing in Competing Supply Chains with Imperfect Demand Signals<br>Author: Hongtao Zhang, Associate Professor, Hong Kong Univ of Sci & Tech, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China, imhzhang@ust.hk<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider vertical information sharing in two competing supply chains, each consisting of one manufacturer selling to one retailer. A retailer observes an imperfect demand signal and decides whether to share it with his manufacturer. Both manufacturers face diseconomies of scale in production. We analyze how firms make information sharing, contracting and retail decisions, and how signal precision and competition intensity affect the direct and competitive effect of information sharing.
