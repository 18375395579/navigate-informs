Title: Optimal Incentive Contract under the Risk of Disruptions<br>Author: Ehsan Elahi, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts - Boston, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, 02125, United States of America, ehsan.elahi@umb.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In this research, we consider a single buyer who has the option to procure a seasonal product from one or two suppliers. The suppliers may fail to deliver the orders due to a disruption in their operations. The suppliers can increase their reliability by making costly efforts. Both the buyer and the supplier are assumed to be risk averse in the sense that they maximize the probability of meeting a target-profit. We show the optimal form of incentive contracts which maximizes the buyer’s profit.
