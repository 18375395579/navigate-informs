Title: Using Controlled Curtailment for Integrating Intermittent Renewable Generation<br>Author: Majid Algwaiz, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, mmgwaiz@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiuli Chao, Owen Wu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the integration of intermittent renewable energy plants that are compensated by production based subsidies in a supply function equilibrium model with generators of varying ramping capabilities. We find that reducing the subsidy dampens the intermittency effect through controlled curtailment of renewables, which cuts operational costs and improves the network balance. Curtailment can also reduce market power in an oligopoly, which has favorable operational and price ramifications.
