<br>Title: Reliable Supply Chain Design Considering Facility Failures</br><br>Author: Dinakar Gade, University of Arkansas, 4167 Bell Engineering Center, Department of Industrial Engineering, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, dgade@engr.uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Pohl</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Modern Supply chains are complex and subject to disruption risks such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks. A supply chain risk profile depends on how its main components such as plants, warehouses, etc are configured. We extend Daskin and Snyder (2005) to a two-echelon supply chain design problem. Our objective is to locate the primary facilities and then find the optimal reconfiguration of the supply chain when a disruption has occurred at a facility by assigning multiple backups.</br>
