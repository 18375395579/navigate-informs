Title: Product Launches and Buying Frenzies: A Dynamic Perspective<br>Author: Javad Nasiry, Assistant Professor, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Room 4345, ISOM Dept, HKUST, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, nasiry@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Pascal Courty<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Buying frenzies in which a firm intentionally undersupplies a product during its initial launch phase are a common practice within several industries such as electronics. We develop a dynamic model of buying frenzies based on social coordination among customers and characterize the conditions under which they are optimal. We also propose a measure of consumer desperation and demonstrate that buying frenzies can have a signififcant impact on a firm's profit.
