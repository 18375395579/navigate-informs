<br>Title: Incentive and Quantity Decisions for Remanufacturing in Closed-loop Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Onur Kaya, Asst. Prof., Koc University, Eng 206, Rumelifeneri Yolu, Sariyer, Istanbul, 34450, Turkey, okaya@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a manufacturer producing original products using virgin  materials and remanufactured products using returns where the amount  of returns depend on the incentive offered. We determine the optimal  value of the incentive and the optimal production quantities in a  stochastic demand setting with partial substitution. We analyze 3  different models in centralized and decentralized settings. We also analyze coordinating contracts and present our computational findings.</br>
