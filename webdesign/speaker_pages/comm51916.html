Title: Impact of Friction and Membership Cost and Demand Shape on Coalition Stability in Assembly Models<br>Author: Greys Sosic, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States, sosic@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mahesh Nagarajan<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study an assembly model in which n suppliers sell to a downstream assembler, who faces deterministic price sensitive demand. We look at three types of competition - Supplier Stackelberg, Vertical Nash, Assembler Stackelberg - and allow the suppliers to form coalitions. Using dynamic stability concepts, we predict stable outcomes under different scenarios (linear and nonlinear demand with no friction and membership cost, linear demand with positive friction and/or membership cost).
