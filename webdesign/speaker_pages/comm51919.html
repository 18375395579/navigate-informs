Title: Risk Aversion in Ascending Core-selecting Auctions<br>Author: Ioannis Petrakis, TU München, Room 01.10.055, Boltzmannstr 3, Munich, 85748, Germany, Petrakis.ioannis@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Kemal Guler, Martin Bichler<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We characterize conditions for the perfect Bayesian equilibria of the ascending core-selecting auction mechanism to have the small bidders to drop at the reserve price with risk-averse bidders. Our first main result is a generalization of the condition for a non-bidding equilibrium in (Sano, 2011), which allows for arbitrary concave utility functions. Second, we discuss this condition in the presence of asymmetries, and third, we provide comparative statics.
