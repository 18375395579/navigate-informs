Title: Operational Hedging and Diversification under Exogenous Supply Uncertainty<br>Author: Fabian Sting, WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management, Fabian.Sting@whu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Arnd Huchzermeier<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: When facing supply risk caused by exogenous factors such as adverse weather conditions, firms diversify their supply to not “hold all eggs in one basket? Applying basic real options thinking, a firm decides on investment and production levels of substitutable resources. Capturing correlated, continuous, and disruption-type supply uncertainty, we find generic forms of optimal sourcing policies that depend on the resources' joint reliability profile, capacity costs and contribution margins.
