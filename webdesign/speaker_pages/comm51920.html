Title: Dynamic Bargaining in a Supply Chain with Asymmetric Demand Information<br>Author: Lauren Lu, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, Lauren_Lu@kenan-flagler.unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guoming Lai, Qi Feng<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We analyze a dynamic bargaining game between a seller and a buyer, who negotiate over quantity and payment to trade for a product. Both firms are impatient, and they alternate in making a contract offer  until an agreement is reached. The buyer is privately informed about his type, which can be either high or low, with respect to the property of the uncertain demand he faces. We find the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the bargaining game.
