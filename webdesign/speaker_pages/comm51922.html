<br>Title: A Laboratory Comparison of Auctions and Sequential Mechanisms</br><br>Author: Anthony Kwasnica, Associate Professor of Business Economics, Pennsylvania State University, 332 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, kwasnica@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Davis, Elena Katok</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: When bidders incur a cost to learn their valuations, two common selling mechanisms  are an English auction, and a sequential bidding process. We experimentally compare the two mechanisms, varying the entry cost, and find that, contrary to theory, average seller revenues are higher under the sequential mechanism, while average bidder profits are the same.  We develop a model of noisy bidder entry costs that organizes the experimental data well.</br>
