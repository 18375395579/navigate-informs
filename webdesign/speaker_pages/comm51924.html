<br>Title: A Descent Method for Differential VIs  Arising in  Non-cooperative Differential Nash Equilibrium</br><br>Author: Changhyun Kwon, Ph.D Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, 310 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, chkwon@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Terry Friesz</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider a gap function for differential variational inequalities (DVIs) and study an equivalent optimal control problem. In  particular, we employ a differential gap function -- the so-called D-gap  function -- and its gradient to form a descent method for DVIs. An application of DVIs to differential Nash games is also investigated. In particular, we solve an abstract linear-quadratic differential Nash game and a model of oligopolistic competition.</br>
