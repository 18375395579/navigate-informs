But which price commitment strategy should firms implement? We examine commonly used pricing strategies and propose a new pricing strategy in which the firm commits to discount more frequently than optimal. In a setting where consumers are strategic and incur a cost to search the firm, we show that discount frequently performs the best and in many cases it is optimal (equivalent to maximum social welfare).
