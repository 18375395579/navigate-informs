<br>Title: Optimal Capacity Firming Contracts for Wind Power Generation Firms</br><br>Author: Francois Bouffard, Lecturer, University of Manchester, PO Box 88, Sackville Street, Manchester, M60 1QD, United Kingdom, francois.bouffard@manchester.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Electricity markets whose operating rules penalize generators for being out of balance put wind power generators in a poor competitive position in comparison to power plants with fully-controllable output. Wind capacity firming contracts, whereby the output of a flexible dispatchable plant is coupled to that of wind, offer a way around this weakness. In this work we investigate how one would model and optimize the terms of such contracts.</br>
