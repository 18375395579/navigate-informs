Title: Allocating Subsidies as Network Design - Tractable Fairness Constraints for the System Flow Problem<br>Author: Gonzalo Romero, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 100 Main Street, E62-461, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, gromeroy@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi, Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the problem faced by a central planner allocating subsidies to competing firms that provide a commodity, to minimize its market price subject to a budget constraint and upper bounds on the allocation to each firm. We consider two types of subsidies, co-payments and technology subsidies, and obtain structural results and near optimal solutions in various important cases. Additionally, we characterize a new kind of tractable fairness constraints for the system optimum flow problem.
