Our model consists of an entrant who can only provide the new product, and an incumbent who can provide both. A segment of the customers are dedicated to the new product, while the rest can purchase either. We study how the firms strategically determine their capacities and prices under product evolution, and characterize equilibria under different assumptions about the uncertainty.
