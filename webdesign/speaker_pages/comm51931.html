<br>Title: Contingency Estimation from Risk Factor Analysis</br><br>Author: Ray Strong, IBM, strong@almaden.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tuija Luoma, Sekou Remy, Ruoyi Zhou, Jaakko Paasi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A standard pricing process for a service offering includes an estimation of cost of delivery and contingency costs, together with an analysis of market constraints on price and business model constraints on profit margin. The basic relationship is price = cost + contingency + profit. We describe an adaptive approach to contingency estimation based on the evaluation of an open-ended, hierarchical organization of risk factors.</br>
