Title: Is it more Valuable to Store or Destroy Electricity Surpluses?<br>Author: Yangfang Zhou, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, 50 Stamford Rd, Singapore, 178899, Singapore, helenzhou@smu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Alan Scheller-Wolf, Nicola Secomandi, Stephen Smith<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A typical strategy for dealing with commodity surpluses is to store them for future sale; this storage strategy is a natural choice for dealing with electricity surpluses when wide scale storage is possible. However, because electricity prices can be negative, there exists another potential strategy: To buy electricity surpluses at negative prices and dispose of them. Our analysis suggests that the disposal strategy can be even more valuable for an electricity merchant than the storage strategy.
