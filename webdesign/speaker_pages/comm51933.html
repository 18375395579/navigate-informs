Title: The Value of Supply Chain Finance for the Supplier ?the Interplay of Two Stochastic Credit Lines<br>Author: Robert Grueter, EBS University, Konrad-Adenauer-Ring 15, Wiesbaden, Germany, Robert.Grueter@ebs.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Margarita Protopappa-Sieke, David Wuttke<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Supply chain finance (SCF) is increasingly valued by managers not only because it lowers financing costs of supply chains, but also because it offers financial flexibility to suppliers. In our continuous-time stochastic model we introduce SCF as cost-less stochastic credit line for suppliers. Sensitivity analyses carried out on closed form solutions characterize formally the flexibility value of SCF, providing an explanation for suppliers adopting SCF even in absence of interest rate arbitrage.
