In our continuous-time stochastic model we introduce SCF as cost-less stochastic credit line for suppliers. Sensitivity analyses carried out on closed form solutions characterize formally the flexibility value of SCF, providing an explanation for suppliers adopting SCF even in absence of interest rate arbitrage.</br>
