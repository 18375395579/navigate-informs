Title: Contracting on Consignment Sales<br>Author: Jun Ru, University of Texas at Dallas, SOM3.224, 800 West Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, jun.ru@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yunzeng Wang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Motivated by Amazon's online retailing, we study a consignment contract where the retailer charges a supplier a pre-specified percentage of the list price of the product sold to the market, and the supplier is allowed to choose the list price for its product.  We build a game-theoretic model to demonstrate that managed under such a contract, the channel incurs a minimum loss of 26.4% in efficiency.  We then propose an alternative contract to improve the channel performance.
