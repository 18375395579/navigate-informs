The spot price in the existing housing market is  assumed to follow a diffusion process. The demand approaches housing systems as a Poisson stream and the arrival rate is sensitive to the premium and affected by spot price. The premium of each house is dynamically adusted. Finally, the optimal contract design issue and the optimal capacity investment strategy are developed.
