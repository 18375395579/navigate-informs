We assume each bidder is a node in a graph, and the value of a bidder for the good is a function of the number of neighbors who also have the good.  In this setting, we design an auction whose revenue competes with that of the best single-price revenue.  Our auction uses graph theoretic techniques combined with ideas from the random sampling literature for digital goods auctions.</br>
