Title: Auctioning a Networked Good<br>Author: Nicole Immorlica, CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 6 Purgatory Road, Mont Vernon, NH, 03057, United States of America, nickle@eecs.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ning Chen, Arpita Ghosh<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study auctions for an unlimitted supply of a networked good such as access to an online gaming system like Xbox Live.  We assume each bidder is a node in a graph, and the value of a bidder for the good is a function of the number of neighbors who also have the good.  In this setting, we design an auction whose revenue competes with that of the best single-price revenue.  Our auction uses graph theoretic techniques combined with ideas from the random sampling literature for digital goods auctions.
