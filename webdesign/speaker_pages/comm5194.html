Title: Are Consumers Really Strategic? Experimental Study<br>Author: Nikolay Osadchiy, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, nikolay.osadchiy@emory.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elliot Bendoly<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Novel retail selling mechanisms involve a tradeoff between buying now vs later at a lower price. Recreating this setting in a laboratory, we observe a substantial fraction of subjects making decisions consistent with expected utility maximization. We find that subjects are particularly sensitive to whether the information about riskiness of the buy-later option is provided. Implications for revenue management are discussed.
