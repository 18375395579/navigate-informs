Title: Giving it Away to Increase Profits? Price Discrimination and the Effect of Free Goods<br>Author: Jacob Chestnut, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan St. R0400, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, jacobpc@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyun-Soo Ahn, Ravi Anupindi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a provider serving customers who are heterogeneous in their willingness-to-pay and desired quality. A standard approach is to model as an adverse selection problem, which results in a non-linear pricing schedule. Motivated by empirical evidence that consumer's utility becomes discontinuous when the goods are offered for free, we examine situations where giving away for free can indeed increase the provider's profit.
