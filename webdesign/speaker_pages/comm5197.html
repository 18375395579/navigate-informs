This paper presents an optimization model to negotiate airlines hard-block code-share agreements. The model determines optimal number of allocated seats and revenue split strategies for all possible code-sharing partners in the different markets. The model captures the trade-off between incremental revenue from code-sharing demand and lost revenue due to displacement of existing passengers.
