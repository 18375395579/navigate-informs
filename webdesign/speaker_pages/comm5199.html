Title: Competitive Revenue Management of Perishable Assets with Multiple Predetermined Options<br>Author: Ming Hu, Columbia University, mh2252@columbia.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a continuous-time revenue management model under competition. Under the assumption that the available menu of sales targets (prices) is given for quantity competition with substitutable products (price competition with complementary products), we obtain an threshold-type optimal control policy for each player to switch sales target (price) in closed form that can be sustained as an exact Nash equilibrium. Such a policy can be computed in a reasonable computation effort.
