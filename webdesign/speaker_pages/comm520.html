Title: Supply Chain Coordination Under Information Acquisition<br>Author: Tunay Tunca, Professor, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, tunca_tunay@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyoduk Shin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider supply chain coordination with investment in demand forecasting. We show that common pricing schemes suffer from lack of coordination in production quantities and forecast. We show that this problem can be solved through flexible pricing. However, with private information, such mechanisms suffer implementation problems. We propose a contracting scheme that utilizes market interaction and resolves the implementation problems in addition to achieving full coordination.
