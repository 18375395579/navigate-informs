George Shanthikumar, Andrew Lim<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of decentralization in dynamic pricing and network revenue management problems. We consider both the case where agents are risk neutral as well as when they are risk averse (with different aversion levels), and determine conditions under which decentralization which achieves a centralized optimal can be achieved.
