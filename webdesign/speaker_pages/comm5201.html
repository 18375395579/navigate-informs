Title: Financial Hedging and Optimal Procurement Policies under Correlated Price and Demand<br>Author: Ankur Goel, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States of America, axg312@case.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fehmi Tanrisever<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a firm that procures an input commodity to produce an output commodity to sell to the end retailer. The firm can sell the output commodity to the retailer either through a spot or a forward contract. We show that partial hedging dominates both perfect hedging and no-hedging when input price, output price, and demand are correlated. We also identify conditions under which myopic policy is optimal.
