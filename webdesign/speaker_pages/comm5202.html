If this were actually the case, then the same value for the volatility parameter in the Black-Scholes formula could be used to price all options on a particular stock. Market data shows signi.cant departures from this idealized situation, and for exotic options (i.e., those with path-dependent payo.s), these departures can create serious errors in prices and hedges. To address this short-coming of the Black-Scholes model, a variety of models have been implemented in which the volatility is itself a stochastic process. One of these is the local volatility model of B. Dupire in which the volatility at each time is a function of the time and the stock price at that time. This function is chosen so that the prices produced by the model match a variety of market prices of calls and puts with various expiration dates and strike prices. In addition, some ad hoc .xes have been implemented. One of these ad hoc .xes is to assume that the distribution of the stock price at each time is a mixture of log-normal distributions. This mixture of distributions can produce realistic prices for a variety of European calls and puts with the same expiration date, and thus has practical appeal. However, it is not really a model because it speci.es the distribution of the stock price at one or several times but does not specify how the stock price evolves over time. In other words, it does not specify the distribution of the paths of the stock price.   In this talk, we describe how to build a model for the evolution of the stock price so that at each particular time, the distribution of the stock price is a mixture of the distributions produced by two di.erent models. This model is in the spirit of a local volatility model, although the volatility may now depend on more than the current time and the current stock price. The model extends a result by Gy¨ongy on the construction of a di.usion process that has desired one-dimensional distributions.
