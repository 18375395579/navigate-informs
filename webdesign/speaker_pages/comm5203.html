We analyze the impact of flexibility on the profits and show that lead time flexibility does not affect profits whereas inventory flexibility significantly does. We develop an exact algorithm for optimal base stock level, show that lead time quotes are shorter in a MTO system, and that increasing the inventory level may increase the number of customers waiting.</br>
