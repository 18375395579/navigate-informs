Title: Analysis of Lead Time and Inventory Flexibility for Base Stock Inventory Systems<br>Author: Secil Savasaneril, Assistant Professor, Middle East Technical University, Industrial Engineering Department, Ankara, Turkey, secil@ie.metu.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Pinar Keskinocak, Paul Griffin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a lead time quotation problem with inventory holding where demand is lead time sensitive and unmet due dates are penalized. We analyze the impact of flexibility on the profits and show that lead time flexibility does not affect profits whereas inventory flexibility significantly does. We develop an exact algorithm for optimal base stock level, show that lead time quotes are shorter in a MTO system, and that increasing the inventory level may increase the number of customers waiting.
