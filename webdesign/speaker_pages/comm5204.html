Title: Nash Equilibria in Duopolistic Power Markets under Diverse Pricing and Uplift Mechanism<br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Pennsylvania State University, 353 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, udaybag@engr.psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sean Meyn, Gui Wang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider a capacitated duopolistic power market in which firms bid their offer functions. Allocation decisions are specified through commitment problems while pricing is considered via either marginal cost or convex hull pricing mechanisms. Furthermore, most markets are complicated by varying uplift mechanisms. The resulting Nash games are characterized by discontinuous payoff functions and existence is not immediate. We investigate the existence of of Nash equilibria in such settings.
