The objective is to find a policy to allocate the ‘new?and ‘old?version parts to products when products fail, that maximizes the product uptime. We develop a periodic review inventory system in which the number of parts that fail in a period depends on the number of products in operation. It is shown that a threshold type of policy is optimal for certain class of demand distributions.
