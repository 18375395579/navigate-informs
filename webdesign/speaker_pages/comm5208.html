In each period the farmer decides the allocation due to yield and spot price uncertainties given the cross-farming benefit, i.e, the yield is stochastically larger when a product is not grown in the same farm space for two consecutive periods. We investigate the impact of yield and price variability for each product, and the correlation among these uncertainties on the optimal farm allocation decision.</br>
