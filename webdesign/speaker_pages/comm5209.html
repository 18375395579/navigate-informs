Impulse control theory is used to solve the problem of finding the optimal times, types and amounts of interventions. For this, we first model an impulse control problem when the controller's action affects the state as well as the dynamics of the state process for a random amount of time. We then apply our model to solve the central bank intervention problem. Our results suggest that the central bank would intervene less frequently (more frequently) and the optimal policy is more (less) expensive than its corresponding value without the market reactions if the market reactions increase (decrease) the exchange rate volatility.</br>
