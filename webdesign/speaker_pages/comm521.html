<br>Title: What Drives the Geographical Differences in Deceased Donor Organ Procurement in the United States?</br><br>Author: Mazhar Arikan, Assistant Professor, University of Kansas, School of Business, Lawrence, KS, United States of America, mazhar@ku.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rodney Parker, John J. Friedewald, Baris Ata</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The deceased-donor kidney allocation system suffers from severe shortages of available organs while there is significant variation in the procurement rates across different geographies in the US. The empirical analysis reveals that the intent of procurement increases with organ quality, the median waiting time for a transplant, and the competition among transplant centers. A counterfactual study shows that broader sharing of lower quality organs leads to an increase in the procurement rates.</br>
