Title: Theories of Behavior in Principal-Agent Relationships with Hidden Action<br>Author: Claudia Keser, Research Staff Member, IBM, T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, ckeser@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Marc Willinger<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In a laboratory experiment on a principal-agent game we evaluate the predictive success of agency theory to and the FAIR-OFFER theory suggested by Keser/Willinger (2000). We find that fair-offer theory generally predicts observed contract offers better than agency theory. However, the predictive success of the fair-offer theory decreases, while the one of standard agency theory increases when we increase the agent's effort costs (i.e. reduce expected net surplus of a contract).
