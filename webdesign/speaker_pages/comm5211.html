Title: An Internet Based Pricing and Booking Tool<br>Author: David Post, CEO, SigmaZen, Bommersheimerweg 31, Bad Homburg, HE, 61348, Germany, david.post@sigmazen.biz<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This presentation introduces a pricing and booking tool that airlines are using for the disposal of distressed inventory. The tool is targeted at time-flexible airline travellers and outsources the product specification to the customer. The tool generates attractive incremental revenues but an even greater benefit may be the creation of a rich data set of revealed customer preference data. This is generated from the high numbers of customer interactions as well as the results of the online questionnaire offered to purchasers. Furthermore, this data set may be used to develop sophisticated pricing algorithms.
