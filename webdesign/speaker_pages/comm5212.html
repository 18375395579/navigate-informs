<br>Title: Designing Subsidies: Commitment vs. Flexibility</br><br>Author: Ruben Lobel, University of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, rlobel@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maxime Cohen, Georgia Perakis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study how policy adjustments in subsidy programs (e.g. solar panels) interact with production decisions. We model the interaction between a government and an industry player in a two-period game setting under uncertain demand. We show how the timing of decisions will affect the cost of the subsidy program. In particular, we show that when the government commits to a fixed policy, it spends less on the subsidy program because it signals the supplier to produce more in the earlier stage.</br>
