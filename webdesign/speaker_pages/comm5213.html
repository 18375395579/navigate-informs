We derive the optimal ordering policy of a retailer from two types of suppliers: 1) mainstream farm with large, stable supply that is located far from the retail store, and 2) local farm with small, uncertain capacity that is located close to the retail store. We show how the retailer's ordering policy affect the utilization of the local farms.</br>
