<br>Title: Investing in Pollution Abatement Innovations under Emission Taxes and Cap-and-trade</br><br>Author: Francois Giraud-Carrier, University of Utah, David Eccles School of Business, 1655 E Campus Center Dr, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, f.giraud-carrier@utah.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Krishnan S. Anand</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We compare the incentives of polluting firms to invest in an innovative pollution abatement technology under two popular pollution governance structures-- emission taxes and cap-and-trade. In our model, firms first decide whether to adopt the (costly) innovative technology, and then make production and abatement decisions. We compare the impact of each governance structure on firms?pollution abatement strategies, output and profits, consumer surplus and welfare.</br>
