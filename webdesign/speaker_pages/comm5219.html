<br>Title: Suppliers Competition in Decentralized Assembly Systems with Price-sensitive and Uncertain Demand</br><br>Author: Yunzeng Wang, University of California, Riverside, 900 University Avenue, Riverside, CA, 92521, United States of America, yunzeng.wang@ucr.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Li Jiang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In a decentralized assembly channel, firms interact strategically with each other in multiple ways. These include 1) vertical interaction between the assembler and components suppliers, 2) horizontal complementary interaction among suppliers producing complementary components, and 3) horizontal substitutable interaction among suppliers producing substitutable components. We explore how these interactions work together to effect the equilibrium formation of firms?decisions and performances.</br>
