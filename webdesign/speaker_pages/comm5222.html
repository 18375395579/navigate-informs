From a given set of product variants of a category, both retailers must determine what variants to stock as well as the purchasing quantities. Taken into account of the consumer choice, we obtain interesting structural properties of the optimal assortment strategy and the equilibrium assortments. We also analyze the effects of various factors on the equilibrium assortments.</br>
