There are safety regulations set to reduce the risk. Companies are balancing between safety efforts and production competition with other companies. We model and compare two games: a one-company game without competition and a two-company game with competition, both with the government as a regulator. Our results indicate that competition increases a company’s threshold for risk and therefore requires stricter government regulation.</br>
