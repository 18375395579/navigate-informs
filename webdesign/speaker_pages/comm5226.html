Title: Lost Demand in a Competitive Environment<br>Author: Zvi Drezner, Professor, California State University, Fullerton, CA, 92834, United States, zdrezner@fullerton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tammy Drezner<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In many competitive situations not all the buying power is spent at the competing facilities because there are substitute products available. These substitute products are not as desirable as the product in question, but customers will purchase the less desirable substitutes if they are more conveniently available. We construct a model that considers a decline in demand as a function of the distance to competing facilities. Solution methods are proposed and computational experiments reported.
