<br>Title: Effects of Information Transparency on Supply Chain Coordination Under Competition</br><br>Author: Kevin Zhu, Associate Professor, University of California, The Rady School of Management, San Diego, CA, 92093-0093, United States, kxzhu@ucsd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zach Zhou</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Information sharing has been shown to benefit a supply chain. Developing a game theoretic model, we show that information transparency can create value, yet it affects retailers and manufacturers very differently: one side will always be hurt. This means that the theoretical benefits of information sharing will not materialize, a fundamental challenge with information sharing in supply chains. To deal with this issue, a discriminatory pricing scheme is proposed to internalize the incentives.</br>
