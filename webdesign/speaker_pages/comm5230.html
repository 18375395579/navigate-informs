Title: Assortment Planning with Stockout-based Substitution<br>Author: Dorothee Honhon, University of Texas, Dorothee.Honhon@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the optimal assortment and inventory levels for a discrete set of products with varying prices and costs in order to maximize expected profit in a single-period setting.  We use a fluid-type model to represent customer demand and obtain the optimal solution under stockout-based substitution.  We then analyze the tradeoffs involved in making assortment decisions.
