<br>Title: Pricing Weather Derivatives: A Multicommodity Market Equilibrium Approach</br><br>Author: Yongheon Lee, Graduate Student, IEOR Dept. University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, yhlee@newton.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Risk averse agents are exposed to correlated price and quantity risk in single commodities, which in turn are correlated with weather. They hedge their revenue risk using price based instruments on their commodity and weather derivatives. The equilibrium price of the weather derivative emerges from the supply by the issuer who attempts to controls the risk premium on these derivatives and the net demand resulting from the revenue hedging activities of the commodity traders.</br>
