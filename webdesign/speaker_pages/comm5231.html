They hedge their revenue risk using price based instruments on their commodity and weather derivatives. The equilibrium price of the weather derivative emerges from the supply by the issuer who attempts to controls the risk premium on these derivatives and the net demand resulting from the revenue hedging activities of the commodity traders.
