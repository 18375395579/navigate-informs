Title: In-store Media and Channel Management<br>Author: Anthony Dukes, Assistant Professor, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, dukes@marshall.usc.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Retailers open in-store media in stores allowing manufacturers to advertise in-store. We show ISM coordinates a distribution channel on ad volume and sales. A retailer may strategically subsidize manufacturers' ads through ISM to better coordinate the channel. With competition a retailer strategically uses a competitive premium to ration excessive ads among competing suppliers. If manufacturers differ in brand awareness, a retailer charges lower prices to manufacturers with high brand awareness.
