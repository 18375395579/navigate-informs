<br>Title: Designing a Supply Chain Coordinating Guaranteed Profit Margins Contract in the Fashion Apparel Industry</br><br>Author: Chang Hwan Lee, Professor, Ajou University, San 5, Woncheon-dong, Yeontong-gu, Suwon, 443-749, Korea, Republic of, chlee@ajou.ac.kr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Byong-Duk Rhee</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Guaranteed Profit Margin (GPM) is one of the chargebacks that retailers frequently employ in the fashion industry.  With this stipulation, the store demands a vendor’s guarantee of its target mark-up rate even in a markdown operation.  This makes the retailer order too much and later liquidate a greater amount of leftovers.  We propose a new GPM scheme for supply chain coordination.  Specifically, if the retailer compensates the vendor for the same fraction of the joint costs as the guaranteed mark-up rate, the retailer’s quantity decision leads to profit maximization for the entire supply chain.  Thus, the supply chain becomes fully coordinated and provides win-win outcomes for both retailer and vendor.</br>
