The results suggest that: diversification leads to lower market prices; the influence of diversification is mediated by the supply to demand ratio; in each demand case there is a threshold where pivotal dynamics change; pivotal dynamics pre- and post-threshold are the cause of non-linearities in the influence of diversification on market prices.</br>
