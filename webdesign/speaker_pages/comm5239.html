Title: Transmission of Risk in a Supply Chain<br>Author: Stathis Tompaidis, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, stathis.tompaidis@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sheridan Titman, Hamed Ghoddusi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop an equilibrium model of price dynamics and study the transmission of shocks in a supply chain. For the case of crude oil to refined products we show that the relative volatilities of oil and gasoline and their correlation depends on the volatility of supply and demand shocks, elasticities, the convexity of the production function, and the competitiveness of the market. We extend our results to the case of the two-stage supply chain of crude oil to refined products to air travel.
