<br>Title: Spectrum Auction Design - Simple Auctions For Complex Sales</br><br>Author: Martin Bichler, Professor, Technische Universität München, Munich, Germany, mar.bichler@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jacob Goeree, Stefan Mayer, Pasha Shabalin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the impact of two main design choices that spectrum auction designers face in lab experiments: simple “compact bid languages versus “fully expressive bid languages and simple “pay-as-bid payment rules versus “bidder-optimal core-selecting payment rules. We find that simplicity of the bid language has a substantial positive impact on the auction's efficiency and that simplicity of the pricing rule has as a significant impact on revenue.</br>
