It puts students into a role of consumers who decide whether to wait for a possible discount or to buy early at full price but guarantee the product. We discuss the game design from student’s and instructor’s perspectives and comment on its use in business school curriculum. We then present our experiences with the game and provide the analysis of the typical players?strategies.</br>
