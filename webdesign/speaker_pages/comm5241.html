<br>Title: Outsourcing Contracts for a Call Center</br><br>Author: Sameer Hasija, Simon School of Business, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14627, United States, hasijas1@simon.rochester.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Shumsky, Edieal Pinker</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study contracts to co-ordinate the capacity decision of a vendor who has been hired by a client to provide call center support. We consider different types of contracts based on our observations of contracts used by one large vendor. We show when these contracts are coordinating and how coordination can be achieved under information asymmetry about the vendor's productivity. Under each contract type we also consider how profits are allocated between the client and the vendor.</br>
