Title: Demand Learning and Dynamic Pricing for Events<br>Author: Masoud Talebian, Columbia University, 325 Mudd Bldg, NY, NY, 10027, United States of America, mt2251@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guillermo Gallego<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a revenue management model for events where the capacity provider knows from historical data the premium/discount relative to the core value for different seats in the venue and the customers?elasticity. The provider only has a prior about the market size, and does not know the core value that customers assign to the show. We show how the provider should update his prior based on the market response, and update his prices to maximize expected revenues over a rolling horizon.
