Title: Trading Higher Software Piracy for Higher Profits: The Case of Phantom Piracy<br>Author: Ram Gopal, Professor, University of Connecticut, School of Business, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States, ram.gopal@business.uconn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alok Gupta<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper analytically explores the effect of software bundling on software piracy. We develop an economic model of software piracy and product bundling and derive results for optimal level of piracy and profits for individual products as well as for the bundle. Our results indicate that it is possible to trade off the piracy level of one product for overall higher profits, i.e., a seller can derive higher profits even with higher levels of piracy for one of the products in the bundle.
