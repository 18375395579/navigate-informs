We investigate how much (if any) pricing discretion to grant using two data sets –one from an online lender and one from an indirect lender with local pricing discretion. We find that local sales force adjusts prices in a way that improves profitability and this discretion introduces endogeneity into the pricing process, which leads to significant estimation bias.</br>
