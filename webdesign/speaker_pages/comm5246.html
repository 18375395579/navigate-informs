Title: Can There Be Too Much Variety? Limits of Mass Customization<br>Author: Eren Cil, Assistant Professor, University of Oregon, 1208 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, 97403-1208, United States of America, erencil@uoregon.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michael Pangburn<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Firms employ mass customization to closely match customers' taste with the delivered product. In this paper, we additionally consider the brand-level issue of mismatch between customers' tastes and the firm's full range of products. We show that the resulting limit of mass customization, even when costless to the firm, is bounded. We also show that the firm should serve extreme-taste consumers via fixed and lower-priced niche outlier products that are not subject to customization.
