We identify when customer segmentation drives the remanufacturing decision, so that the firm benefits from offering new products as remanufactured. While in the single period model the substitution decision depends solely on the new product cost, it depends on the weighted average of manufacturing and remanufacturing cost in the steady state.</br>
