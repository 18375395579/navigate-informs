Title: Coordination of Recycling Networks<br>Author: Grit Walther, Technische Universität Braunschweig, Katharinenstr. 3, Braunschweig, 38106, Germany, g.walther@tu-bs.de<br>Coauthor(s): Thomas S. Spengler, Eberhard Schmid<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A decentralized negotiation mechanism is presented allowing independent recycling companies to assign tasks within recycling networks. Thereby, contracts are negotiated between a focal company and recycling companies with minimum data exchange. The negotiation approach is implemented via Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient optimization. Applicability of the mechanism is shown and performance is tested on a numerical study based on real-world data. Managerial insights are derived.
