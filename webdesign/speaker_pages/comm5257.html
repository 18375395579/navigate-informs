Title: Global Product Line Design<br>Author: Ram Bala, Indian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, AP, India, ram_bala@isb.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vish Krishnan, Wenge Zhu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We seek to understand how the practice of globally distributed product development interacts with a firm’s product line design problem. While the addition of new locations offers the firm the potential of lower wages, it also introduces coordination costs. We consider the case of a firm resorting to distributed development with or without development capacity constraints. We find that capacitated distribution in the presence of coordination costs can make product lines conditionally optimal.
