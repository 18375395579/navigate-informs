Unfortunately, suppliers often respond with deception - by hiding noncompliance. We identify conditions under which higher auditing effort or financial incentives backfire - causing the supplier to invest less in compliance. We also identify conditions under which a buyer should commit to invite a third party to audit is supplier and to publicize violations.</br>
