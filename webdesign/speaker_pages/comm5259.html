Title: Contingent Pricing in the Presence of Loss Averse Consumers with Stochastic Reference Level<br>Author: Sami Najafi-Asadolahi, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, sami.najafi@rotman.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Opher Baron, Ming Hu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study an infinite period setting where a profit-maximizing firm sells a single perishable product at each period to two types of consumers: regular consumers, who have a given valuation and whose market size is uncertain; and bargain hunters, who have a low valuation and are abundant. The regular consumers are loss averse with random reference levels that represent their stochastic beliefs about the price and purchase outcome. We show that the firm can benefit from consumers' loss aversion.
