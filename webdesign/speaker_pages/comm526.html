As a result of this, a plethora of point-by-point bid data exists, but there is no systematic approach to analyze it.  Hence, we develop a methodology, BidAnalyzer, to estimate the underlying distributions from which bids are generated for each bidder, even if a bidder does not submit a bid in a specific period. This ability to infer the distribution of each bidder is absent in the literature on auctions, and cannot be determined by other time series approaches (e.g., method of moments or vector autoregression). BidAnalyzer also provides the optimal bid price of each bidder, enabling the buyer to understand whether a bidder has bid too aggressively (and may experience a winner’s curse) or has held back (indicating that there is still “money on the table?.  We illustrate its practical usefulness using two proprietary datasets and a field experiment. Thus, BidAnalyzer enriches the price discovery efforts of the buyer and provides guidance for improving industrial procurement practice.</br>
