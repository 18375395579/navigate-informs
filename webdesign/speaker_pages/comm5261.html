Title: Fulfillment Policies for Bundled Orders<br>Author: Ping Xu, Amazon.com, pingjosephine@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Victor Martinez de Albeniz<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop a stylized model to analyze the fulfillment policy when facing bundled customer orders. Initially, an online retailer stocks inventory for different SKUs in a warehouse. Customers then arrive stochastically and request a bundle: the retailer must decide whether to satisfy the entire bundle, only a subset, or not to satisfy the customer at all. We characterize the structural properties of the profit-to-go function and provide numerical examples to highlight managerial insights.
