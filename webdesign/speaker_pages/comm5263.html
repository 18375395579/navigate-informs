Title: Competitive Price Matching Guarantees: Role of In-store Availability and its Verification<br>Author: Arcan Nalca, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, arcan.nalca@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Tamer Boyaci, Saibal Ray<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Under the simplest form of price matching guarantees (PMG), a firm matches the lower price offered by a competitor store. We study a competition model with two retailers and a manufacturer and derive/compare the equilibrum prices and profits to analyze the effect of in-store availability and its verification on PMGs. The precise effect of in-store availability and its verification is linked to two factors: the relative sizes, and reservation prices, of different customer segments in the market.
