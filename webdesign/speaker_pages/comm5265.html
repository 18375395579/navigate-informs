Title: Congestion-based Leadtime Quotation and Pricing for Revenue Maximization with Heterogeneous Customer<br>Author: Baris Ata, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, b-ata@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Akan, Tava Olsen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a make-to-order system with two customer classes, where customers are sensitive to production leadtime. Upon arrival, customers are quoted a menu of leadtimes as a function of the backlog of work in the system. Customers?leadtime cost functions are assumed to be convex-concave. We combine leadtime quotation, dynamic pricing, and customer scheduling to maximize expected revenue for the firm in a large-capacity asymptotic regime.
