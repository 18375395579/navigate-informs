Title: Dynamic Pricing and Buyer Learning of Product Availability<br>Author: Misuk Lee, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology, gtg438r@mail.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anton J. Kleywegt<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a process in which a seller with limited inventory sets prices in two time periods, and the buyers decide whether to buy in the first time period, second time period, or not at all.  Between the two time periods, buyers obtain additional information about their utilities for the product.  There may not be sufficient inventory to satisfy all demand in the second time period.  Buyers estimate the probability of obtaining product in the second period.  We show that the sequences of buyer decisions converge to an equilibrium, in spite of the observations being dependent on past decisions, and thus being neither independent nor identically distributed.
