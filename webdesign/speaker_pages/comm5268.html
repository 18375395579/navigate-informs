Title: Reserve Prices in Repeated Multi-Unit Auctions: Theory and Estimation<br>Author: Octavian Carare, carare@utdallas.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We estimate the distribution of bidders' valuations for a high-tech product and the sellers' optimal stationary reserve price. A model of search is used to evaluate the effect on bidding of imposing a reserve price. The revenue gain from a reserve price is 25% for a subsample of our auctions.
