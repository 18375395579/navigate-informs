Title: Designing Service Competition among Heterogeneous Suppliers<br>Author: Ehsan Elahi, University of Minnesota, Graduate Program in Industrial & Systems, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, elahi@me.umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Karen Donohue, Saif Benjaafar<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a setting where a buyer orchestrates a competition among a set of potential suppliers based on the service quality the suppliers provide. The fraction of demand allocated to each supplier is calculated using an allocation function. We show how the buyer can construct allocation functions to maximize the quality service received from the suppliers and induce suppliers to offer the maximum feasible service level.
