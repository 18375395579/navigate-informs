Title: Practical Application of Stochastic Simulation within the Supply Chain Environment<br>Author: Jaco Joubert, Principal Operations Researcher, Sasol Technology, 33 Baker Street, Baker Square, Rosebank, 2196, South Africa, jaco.joubert2@sasol.com<br>Coauthor(s): Gerhard Carstens<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The Sasol Nitro explosives business unit identified finished goods storage capacity as a constraint. It is complicated to expand storage capacity due to safety / EIA regulations and therefore imperative that available capacity be used optimally. Stochastic simulation was used to demonstrate the benefits of maximising product flow across the supply chain. An alternative inventory management system resulted in an increase in supply chain throughput capacity without additional storage capacity.
