Title: Emergency Sourcing in a Serial System<br>Author: Amar Sapra, Assistant Professor, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, sapra@ise.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Miao Liu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a two-stage serial system in which the supply to the downstream stage from the upstream stage is prone to disruptions.  In the event of a disruption, the downstream stage can order directly from an emergency supplier.  We analyze this problem to characterize the form of the optimal policy and develop efficient computational procedures.
