<br>Title: Gray Markets, Strategic Consumers and Supply Chain Coordination</br><br>Author: Hamed Mamani, University of Washington, Box 353226, Foster School of Business, UW, Seattle, WA, 98195-3226, United States of America, hmamani@uw.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Foad Iravani, Reza Ahmadi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we consider the effect of contracts for a supply chain under the threat of gray market activities. If internal gray markets are ignored we show the sub-optimality of a number of otherwise coordinating contracts when consumers are strategic. We propose a contract to coordinate this supply chain.</br>
