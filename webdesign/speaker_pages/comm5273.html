We show that options are socially optimal and provide a range of consumer surplus over which options strictly dominate low-to-high pricing. We also consider a duopoly game between providers with finite capacity that compete by offering call options. We compare and contrast our results with the classical Bertrand-Edgeworth model without options.</br>
