<br>Title: Remanufacturing as a Marketing Strategy</br><br>Author: Atalay Atasu, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77300, France, atalay.atasu@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Miklos Sarvary, Luk N. Van Wassenhove</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The profitability of remanufacturing systems for different cost, technology and logistics structures has been extensively investigated in the literature. We provide an alternative and somewhat complementary approach that considers further issues such as the existence of green segments, OEM competition and product life cycle effects. We show that profitability of a remanufacturing system strongly depends on these issues as well as their interactions.</br>
