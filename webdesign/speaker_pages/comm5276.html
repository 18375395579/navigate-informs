A group of airline companies may either purchase their own aircrafts or rent aircrafts from a leasing company. We study the benefit of risk pooling effect, which may be affected by the number of seats in a single aircraft; On the other hand, may be recoverd by using dynamic pricing to adjust the demands of airline tickets. We also explore the benefit from interaction of decisions among the purchasing, leasing and dynamic pricing.</br>
