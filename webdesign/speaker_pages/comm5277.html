<br>Title: How Airlines Compete</br><br>Author: Bill Swan, Chief Economist, Seabury Airline Planning Group, 2232 157th PL SE, Bellevue, WA, 98008, United States of America, bill.swan@cyberswans.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Each airline in the market plans a schedule of departure times and offers a series of fares.  The fundamentals of airlines competing are this: customers choose based on price and time, and those customers who find both airlines equal choose based on secondary characteristics we call quality.  This simple model of the demand side leads to some compelling consequences on the supply side.  The preferred airline strongly dominates in fare in the peaks and in load in the off peaks.</br>
