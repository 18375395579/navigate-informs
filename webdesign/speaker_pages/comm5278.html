<br>Title: Improving the Milk Supply Chain in Developing Countries: Analysis under Competing Intermediaries</br><br>Author: Liying Mu, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 W. Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, muliying@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Milind Dawande, Vijay Mookerjee</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Quality issues in milk ?arising primarily from deliberate adulteration by producers -- have been reported in many developing countries. High testing cost and competition between milk stations (which act as intermediaries by buying milk from producers and selling it to firms) are identified as the main causes for the low quality of milk. We propose a mechanism to incentivize high-quality milk with minimum testing, in the presence of competing milk stations.</br>
