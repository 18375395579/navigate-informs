<br>Title: Knowledge Management for New Product Development in a Competitive Environment</br><br>Author: Gulru Ozkan, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, gulru.ozkan@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cheryl Gaimon</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a game theoretic model that explores knowledge management strategies in an NPD domain for two competing firms. Firms?knowledge levels increase via problem solving (PS) and knowledge transfer/sharing (KT). KT mechanisms considered are general licensing, cross licensing, and joint venture. Firms?maximize profit (consists of revenue/cost of KT, cost of PS and revenue earned from new products). Optimal solutions characterize the extent and the mechanism that firms pursue PS and KT.</br>
