<br>Title: Optimal Consumption and Investment with Asymmetric Long-term/Short-term Capital Gains Taxes</br><br>Author: Min Dai, Associate Professor, National University of Singapore, Dept of Math, Singapore, Singapore, matdm@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yifei Zhong, Hong Liu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose an optimal consumption and investment model with asymmetric longterm/short-term tax rates. We also consider both the case where an investor can get full tax rebate for capital losses and the case where the investor can only carry over capital losses. We show that the optimal consumption and investment policy is qualitatively different from what is found in the standard literature.</br>
