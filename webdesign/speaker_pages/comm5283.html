Title: A Bottom-up Biofuel Market Equilibrium Model for Policy Analysis<br>Author: Leilei Zhang, Iowa State University, 0076 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, leileizh@iastate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Guiping Hu, Lizhi Wang, Yihsu Chen<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: A bottom-up equilibrium model is developed to investigate the supply chain of the biofuel market, and the interaction among farmers, producers, blenders, and consumers in the market. The model simultaneously maximize the profits of all entities in the biofuel market by incorporating the decisions in farmer's land allocation, biomass and biofuel transportation, biofuel production and blending. The structure of the model enables us to study the impact of different policies on the market outcome.
