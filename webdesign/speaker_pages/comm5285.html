Title: Control Rights in R&D Licensing Contracts<br>Author: Pascale Crama, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Singapore, Singapore, pcrama@smu.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Bert De Reyck, Zeger Degraeve<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: R&D projects are fraught with uncertainties, making it difficult to consider all scenarios in licensing contracts.  Control rights allow the holder to react to new information.  First, we study the value of signing a contract.  Then we investigate the optimal allocation of control rights to maximize the licensor’s value when using a contract with upfront and milestone payments and a royalty rate.  We notice an interaction between the choice of contract terms and the allocation of control rights.
