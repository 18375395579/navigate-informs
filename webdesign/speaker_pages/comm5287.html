<br>Title: Competitive Revenue Management with Customer Choice Behavior</br><br>Author: Michael Li, Associate Professor, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Avenue, 639798, Singapore, ZFLI@ntu.edu.sg</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the dynamic pricing models for two substitutable and perishable products with customer choice behavior under monopoly and duopoly respectively. We characterize the structural properties of the value function and the optimal control policy under monopoly. We examine the optimal pricing policy with discrete price set and study the equilibrium in duopoly with finite strategy spaces.</br>
