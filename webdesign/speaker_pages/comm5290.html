Title: Integrated Pricing and Distribution Optimization Applied to the Auto Rental Industry<br>Author: Ivette Arambula, Senior Scientist, Science & Research, PROS, 3100 Main St. #900, Houston, TX, 77002, United States, iarambula@prospricing.com<br>Coauthor(s): Aaron Putnam<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We describe the problem of determining optimized pricing recommendations to satisfy demand of rental products offered to customers subject to limited availability of resources and considering the option of repositioning the resources at a cost. We model it as a network optimization to maximize profit given the forecasted demand, current inventory and distribution costs. We summarize results of simulations to show the profit lift using the joint optimization versus the pricing optimization alone.
