King<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a make-to-order firm, with a geographically distant supplier, that decides the order quantity for each of two supply modes on a periodic basis.  We explore the relationship of product life cycle demand characteristics, through the use of Markovian demand process, and the impact on ordering strategies using a Markov decision process.
