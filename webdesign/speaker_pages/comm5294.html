Among the acquisition modes, Internet and direct mail generate more profitable customers than telemarketing and direct selling.  We find that customers with loyalty cards and/or affinity cards are less profitable. Our work adds to the CRM literature and our results have managerial implications for marketing resource allocation.</br>
