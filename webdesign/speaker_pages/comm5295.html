<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing with Behavioral Considerations</br><br>Author: Javad Nasiry, PhD Student, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, Javad.NASIRY@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ioana Popescu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study a dynamic pricing problem where consumers purchase decisions are anchored on a reference price, derived from past prices. We focus on asymmetric reference price formation mechanisms, behaviourally motivated by the peak-end rule and loss aversion. The firm's optimal pricing strategies are characterized and compared to the literature.</br>
