Title: Dynamic Pricing with Behavioral Considerations<br>Author: Javad Nasiry, PhD Student, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, Javad.NASIRY@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ioana Popescu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a dynamic pricing problem where consumers purchase decisions are anchored on a reference price, derived from past prices. We focus on asymmetric reference price formation mechanisms, behaviourally motivated by the peak-end rule and loss aversion. The firm's optimal pricing strategies are characterized and compared to the literature.
