Watson Research Center, Mathematical Sciences, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, chenritzo@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We address the problem of aligning demand and supply in configure-to-order systems. Using stochastic programming methods, this study demonstrates the value of accounting for the uncertainty associated with how orders are configured, as well as the value of component supply flexibility in the presence of order configuration uncertainty. We position our models within an increasingly popular business process called Sales and  Operations Planning. Computational analyses were performed using data obtained from IBM System and Technology group.</br>
