Title: Price and Service Competition in an Outsourced Supply Chain<br>Author: Jennifer Ryan, Senior Lecturer, UCD School of Business, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland, jennifer.ryan@ucd.ie<br>Coauthor(s): Yue Jin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a single buyer who outsources the manufacturing of a given product to two competing suppliers. The buyer allocates demand between the two suppliers on the basis of both price and service. Thus, the suppliers compete on both price and service and seek to maximize their respective profits. The buyer chooses an allocation policy, i.e., specifies the relative importance of price vs. service, in order to minimize her own costs. We characterize the equilibrium behavior of the system.
