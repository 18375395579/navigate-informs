Mudd, New York, NY, 10027, United States, sk75@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guillermo Gallego, Robert Phillips</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A callable product is a unit of capacity sold to self-selected low-fare customers who willingly grant the capacity provider the option to ``call'' the capacity at a pre-specified recall price. We show that callable products provide a riskless source of additional revenue to the capacity provider.  We illustrate how the benefits from offering callable products can be significant, especially when high-fare demand uncertainty is large.</br>
