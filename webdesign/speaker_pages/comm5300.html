Title: Contracting Consignment Sales<br>Author: Jun Ru, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, Richardson, TX, 75083, United States of America, jxr052000@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yunzeng Wang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Motivated by Amazon.com's online retailing, we study a consignment contract where retailer changes a supplier a pre-specified percentage of the ‘list price?of the product sold to the market, where the supplier is allowed to choose the list price for its product.  We build a game-theoretic model to demonstrate that managed under such a contract, the channel incurs a minimum loss of 26.4% in efficiency.  We then propose an alternative contract to improve the channel performance.
