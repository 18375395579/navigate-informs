When the retailer uses the locally optimal (s,S) policy, there is randomness in both order time and order quantity to the supplier. When the retailer uses the non-optimal (R,T) policy there is randomness only in order quantity. When the supplier has knowledge of the end-customer demand information, we hypothesize that the (R,T) policy is more cost effective.</br>
