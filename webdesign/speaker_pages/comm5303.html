Title: Demand Management and Inventory Control for Substitutable Products<br>Author: Zhengliang Xue, Duke University, 1 Towerview Drive, Fuqua School of Business, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, zhengliang.xue@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jeannette Song<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study dynamic inventory and pricing decisions for a set of substitutable products over a finite horizon. Demands are random and price sensitive. In each period, we decide the price and order quantity for each product. Unsatisfied demands are backlogged. There are linear purchasing, inventory-holding and backorder costs.  We characterize the optimal policy that maximizes the total expected discounted profit and devise an algorithm to compute it.
