<br>Title: Inventory Collaborations among n-Independent Retailers with Asymmetry Demand Information</br><br>Author: Hui Zhao, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 403 W. State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, zhaoh@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xinghao Yan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Most previous literature on inventory sharing has assumed common information. In this paper, we study an inventory sharing game among n retailers who privately hold demand information, non-cooperatively determine their ordering quantities, but cooperatively share inventory with each other. Considering information credibility and potential coalition issues, we develop a coordination mechanism, which, implemented with a truth-inducing scheme, guarantees an all-win situation for all parties.</br>
