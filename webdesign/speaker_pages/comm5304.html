Title: Inventory Collaborations among n-Independent Retailers with Asymmetry Demand Information<br>Author: Hui Zhao, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 403 W.

In this paper, we study an inventory sharing game among n retailers who privately hold demand information, non-cooperatively determine their ordering quantities, but cooperatively share inventory with each other. Considering information credibility and potential coalition issues, we develop a coordination mechanism, which, implemented with a truth-inducing scheme, guarantees an all-win situation for all parties.
