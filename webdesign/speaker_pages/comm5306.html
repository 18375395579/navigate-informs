We show how spontaneous trust and trustworthiness are lower in China than in the U.S., and Chinese show higher trust towards U.S. partners. The two populations exhibit drastically different behavioral dynamics under repeated interactions, rendering a Chinese supply chain to benefit more from a long-term relationship.
