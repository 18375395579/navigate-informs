Title: Forward and Spot Prices under Cournot Competition and Stochastic Demand<br>Author: Dana Popescu, Department of Information, Operations and Management Science, Leonard Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, NY, United States of America, dpopescu@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sridhar Seshadri<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We establish the existence of a forward market under Cournot competition and stochastic demand. We compute equilibrium forward and spot prices. We show that the size of the forward market significantly depends on the uncertainty in demand. Our results explain the occasional disappearance of spot market for highly volatile goods.
