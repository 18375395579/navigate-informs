Title: Price Optimization: A Field Experiment in Online Retailing<br>Author: Jun Li, Assistant Professor, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, junwli@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Marshall Fisher, Santiago Gallino<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Many retailers track competitors' prices on a daily basis. However, how to respond to this information is not well understood in practice. The answer is dependent upon consumer substitution patterns among competing retailers as well as across similar products. We conducted a field experiment and developed an estimation framework to obtain self- and cross- price elasticities with limited information of consumer choices (known competitors?prices but unknown choices over competitors?products).
