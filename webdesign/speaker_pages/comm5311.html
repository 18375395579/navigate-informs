We find that even though dealers receive inventory stocking recommendations from the manufacturer, a multitude of economic and organizational factors jointly determine dealers?actual inventory policy choice and inventory levels.  Those factors include demand pattern, holding cost, competition, management capability and infrastructure.</br>
