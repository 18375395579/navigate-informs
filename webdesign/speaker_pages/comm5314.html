Lee, Robert Swinney</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the sourcing decisions of firms that may choose between two types of suppliers: responsible suppliers that are costly but follow strict social and environmental responsibility standards, and normal suppliers that are less costly but may randomly experience responsibility violations. We explore how three structural elements of the supply chain influence the firm’s optimal sourcing decision: downstream competition, concentration of the supplier base, and supply chain flexibility.</br>
