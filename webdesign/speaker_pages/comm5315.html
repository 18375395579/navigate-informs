<br>Title: Auction Theory in OR/MS Settings</br><br>Author: Aleksandar Pekec, Associate Professor, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, pekec@duke.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Standard auction theory results are sensitive to assumptions important in MS and OR applications. Uncertainty in supply/demand has implications on equilibrium existence and revenue rankings of uniform and discriminatory multi-item auctions. Furthermore, choice of an auction information policy and supply quantities are important parameters for revenue optimization.</br>
