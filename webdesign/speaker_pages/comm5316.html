Consumers solve a dynamic program to make purchases. We introduce the inclusive value processes to reduce the dimension of the estimation problem. We estimate consumers?preferences using the model and individual level transaction data. By conducting counterfactual experiments, we find that warranties are underpriced. Lastly, we explore the impact of changing product reliability on the retailer’s profit.</br>
