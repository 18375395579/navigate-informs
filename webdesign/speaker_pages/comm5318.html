<br>Title: Renewal Strategies for Perishable Products with Random Demand and Dynamic Pricing</br><br>Author: Amar Sapra, Assistant Professor, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, sapra.amar@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Li-Ming Chen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider joint inventory control and pricing decisions for a perishable item with random demand and lost-sales. The demand in a period depends on both age of the inventory and price. We develop three different models with increasing flexibility. In the first model, the replenishment frequency is determined in advance and is fixed during the planning horizon. This assumption is relaxed in the second model. In the third model, we allow partial disposal when excessive inventory is on-hand.</br>
