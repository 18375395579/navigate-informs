<br>Title: VidoCo Demand Forecast Information Sharing Case</br><br>Author: Duygu Dagli, PhD Student, University of Texas at Dallas, Naveen Jindal School of Management, 800 West Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, dxd115020@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozalp Ozer, Yanchong Zheng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: VidoCo Demand Forecast Information Sharing Case has been recently completed and has not been used in a classroom yet. However, the complementary computer simulation, the Forecast Information Sharing Game, has been used in undergraduate, MBA and executive MBA level courses at MIT, Stanford, and University of Texas at Dallas. The game successfully facilitated rich discussions. As students were able to put themselves in the shoes of both the downstream and upstream firms, they were able to diagnose the reasons for information asymmetry. They also came up with strategies, which would make them communicate demand forecasts truthfully or would make them trust the forecasts reported by the downstream firms.</br>
