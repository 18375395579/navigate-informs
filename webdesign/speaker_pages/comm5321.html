Title: Bank Compensation: Sprint Swimming in Short Bonus Pools<br>Author: Jussi Keppo, University of Michigan Industrial and Operations Engineering, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, keppo@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Esa Jokivuolle<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We analyze the link between bankers' risk taking incentives and the duration of their compensation. More specifically, we derive conditions under which compensation duration decreases bankers' risk taking. Empirical results indicate that a proxy for shorter compensation duration (higher bonus per salary) is related with higher leverage of banks.
