Title: Dynamic Pricing to Minimize Maximum Regret<br>Author: Nicholas G. Hall, Ohio State University, 2100 Neil Avenue, 658 Fisher Hall, Columbus, OH, 43210-1144, United States of America, hall_33@fisher.osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhi-Long Chen, Hans Kellerer<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a two period, single product problem where a decision maker prices inventory in two periods. The demand for the product is a stochastic, nonincreasing function of price with known upper and lower bounds. We minimize the maximum total regret over the two periods. Three different models are solved optimally by polynomial time algorithms using systems of linear inequalities. The results of a computational study provide robust managerial insights about effective pricing.
