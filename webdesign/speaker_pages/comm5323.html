State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, zhaoh@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xinghao Yan, Kwei Tang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We explore quality-based supplier selection when product quality is suppliers' private information, quality itself exhibits uncertainty, and quality can be improved by efforts from the suppliers and/or the buyer.In selecting the supplier,the buyer can choose two different strategies, a promise strategy or a requirement strategy. We investigate how these two different strategies affect the efforts in quality improvement and the supply chain profits under different quality improvement scenarios.</br>
