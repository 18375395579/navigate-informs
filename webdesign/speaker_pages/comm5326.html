<br>Title: An Empirical Investigation of Suppliers?Participation Behavior at B2B Auctions</br><br>Author: Xin Wang, Brandeis University, 415 South Street, Waltham, MA, United States of America, xinwang@brandeis.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Donglei Qiu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Using actual B2B auction data on automobile parts and a count-data survival model, we study suppliers?participation behavior over time and identify the factors that influence such behavior. Our results indicate that suppliers' past attendance behavior, heterogeneity and their competence in providing low and complete quotes significantly influence participation decisions. Though completeness of a quote is required to win an auction, its role is not as important as that of providing a low price.</br>
