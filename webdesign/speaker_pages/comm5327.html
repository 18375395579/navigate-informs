<br>Title: Investigating the Dynamics in Two-settlement Electricity Markets Using Agent-based Model</br><br>Author: Daniel J. Veit, Professor, University of Mannheim, Schloss, Mannheim, BW, 68131, Germany, veit@uni-mannheim.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anke Weidlich</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We investigate a two-settlement electricity market and its economic outcome in comparison with a single-settlement market. Generators sign strategic forward contracts and are involved in spatial oligopolistic competition in the spot market. The spot market is cleared by an ISO who aims at maximizing welfare. The forward market is cleared using a uniform price mechanism. Our simulations show that the introduction of a forward market leads to lower prices in the spot market.</br>
