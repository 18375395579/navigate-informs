Title: Multi-market Facility Network Design with Offshoring Applications<br>Author: Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu, PhD Student, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, MEDS Department, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, lauren-lu@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jan Van Mieghem<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper examines the offshoring decision from a network capacity investment perspective. We analyze two strategic network design questions: (1) Should the common part be produced centrally or in two local facilities? (2) If a centralization strategy is adopted for the common component, which market should the facility be located in? We present a transportation cost threshold that captures costs, revenues, and demand risks, and below which centralization is optimal.
