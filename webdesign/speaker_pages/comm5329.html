<br>Title: The Computation of Approximate Competitive Equilibrium is PPAD-hard</br><br>Author: Ye Du, University of Michigan, 2260 Hayward Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, duye@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaotie Deng</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Arrow and Debreu showed in 1954 that, under mild  conditions, a competitive economy always has an equilibrium. In  this paper, we show that, given a competitive economy that fully  respects all the conditions of Arrow-Debreu's existence theorem,  for any positive constant $h>0$, it is PPAD-hard to compute a  $\frac{1}{n^{h}}$-approximate competitive equilibrium.</br>
