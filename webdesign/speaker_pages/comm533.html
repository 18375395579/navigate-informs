<br>Title: Relational Investment in Production with Incomplete Contracts</br><br>Author: Owen Ma, University of Texas-Dallas, 800 W. Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, owenma@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Suresh Sethi, Ernan Haruvy, Elena Katok</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Incomplete contracts may involve a hold-up problem, resulting in inefficient levels of investment. We model it as a sequential move game with asymmetric information. Absence behavioral considerations, equilibrium implies zero investment. However, with reciprocal motives, the hold-up problem may be mitigated by a credible threat. We propose such a model. In addition, we look at reputation as an alternative mechanism for mitigating the problem. We conduct experiments to test predictions.</br>
