Title: Relational Investment in Production with Incomplete Contracts<br>Author: Owen Ma, University of Texas-Dallas, 800 W.

We model it as a sequential move game with asymmetric information. Absence behavioral considerations, equilibrium implies zero investment. However, with reciprocal motives, the hold-up problem may be mitigated by a credible threat. We propose such a model. In addition, we look at reputation as an alternative mechanism for mitigating the problem. We conduct experiments to test predictions.
