<br>Title: A Collaborative Decentralized Distribution System with Demand Updates</br><br>Author: Ulas Ozen, Researcher, Bell Labs Ireland, Blanchardstown Industrial Park, Blanchardstown, Dublin, Dublin 15, Ireland, U.Ozen@tm.tue.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Greys Sosic, Marco Slikker</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a distribution system that consists of a manufacturer, a warehouse, and n retailers, which face stochastic demand and order from the manufacturer. The retailers can update their demand forecasts, while their orders are shipped to the warehouse. We analyze cooperation between the retailers with and without information sharing, and we investigate its impact on the retailers and the manufacturer. Afterwards, we focus on coordination of the entire supply chain through buy-back contracts.</br>
