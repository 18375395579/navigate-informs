Title: VaR Constraint for Newsvendors: Risk Preference Implication and Remedy<br>Author: Rong Li, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China, joannali77@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a mean profit-maximizing firm who controls profit downside risk using VaR constraint, known to reflect risk aversion. We, however, find that some VaR parameters can imply risk seeking. The firm's risk attitude demands adjusting inventory level downward (risk-averse) or upward (risk-seeking) from risk neutral level. However, such adjustment is no longer needed if demand is correlated with price of a financial asset, as the firm's risk can always be completely counteracted financially.
