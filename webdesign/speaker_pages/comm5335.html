<br>Title: Procurement Strategies in a Three-tier Supply Chain with Private Demand Information</br><br>Author: Dimitris Kostamis, University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler Business School, CB #3490, McColl Bldg., Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, Dimitris_Kostamis@unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Izak Duenyas</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain with an OEM, a tier-1 and a tier-2 supplier. The OEM has private demand information but no market power over the suppliers, and can choose to contract with both suppliers or with the tier-1 supplier only. While we show that the OEM is better off contracting only with the tier-1 supplier if suppliers employ full price-quantity schedules, the OEM might be better  off contracting with both if they offer just as many contracts as the number of possible demand types.</br>
