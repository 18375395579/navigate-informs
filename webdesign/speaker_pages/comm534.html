Title: Dynamic Referrals in Peer-to-peer Media Distribution<br>Author: Kartik Hosanagar, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, PA, kartikh@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yong Tan, Peng Han<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Product diffusion in P2P is unique because free riders ?users who download content from others in the network without redistributing it to others ?can create a supply constraint that results in the incomplete fulfillment of generated demand. P2P firms offer distribution referrals, i.e. payments to users who distribute content to others, to provide users with incentives to distribute content. In this paper, we study a P2P firm’s optimal referral strategy.
