Hall<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consider a multiple product supply chain with one manufacturer and several distributors, where capacity constraints prevent the manufacturer from meeting all its orders. We model the manufacturer’s problem as a combined scheduling and negotiation problem. We model the distributors?problem as a cooperative game, where the distributors make revised decisions about order quantities. We discuss the value of information sharing and cooperation in the supply chain, and provide managerial insights.
