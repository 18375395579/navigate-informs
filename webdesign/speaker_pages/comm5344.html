Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States of America, yxu@exchange.sba.miami.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain with a financially constrained retailer, and examine the implications of the retailer's capital constraint on the selection of supply chain coordinating contracts. We demonstrate that several well-accepted results on supply chain coordinating contracts need to be reexamined. We then propose and study a new coordinating contract form: manufacturer financing contract in which the manufacturer provides financing for the retailer's purchase.
