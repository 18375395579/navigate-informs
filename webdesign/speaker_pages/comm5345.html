We show how capability variance combines with transaction costs to shape specialization and profitability for the upstream and downstream segments. We then investigate how an upstream cost-saving innovation drives changes in scope and profitability for upstream, downstream, and integrated firms. Its effects can “ripple through?the value chain, affecting profit patterns in counterintuitive ways.</br>
