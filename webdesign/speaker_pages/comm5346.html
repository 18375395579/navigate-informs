Title: Quality Investment, Pricing, and Inspection Decisions in Supply Chains<br>Author: Murat Erkoc, Assistant Professor, University of Miami, College of Engineering, P.O.

The supplier chooses the quality level and the wholesale price, whereas the buyer sets the inspection policy and the resale price. Higher quality and inspection do not only enhance demand through improved consumer perception but also reduce external and internal failure costs caused by defective products.
