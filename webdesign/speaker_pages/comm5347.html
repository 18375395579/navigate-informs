We model a two-product firm that decides on its technology choice (flexible versus dedicated) and capacity level under demand uncertainty, and the production quantities after this uncertainty is resolved. Differing from the majority of the stochastic capacity investment literature, we assume that the firm is budget-constrained both in the capacity investment and production stages.</br>
