Contract customers are offered a uniform price and lead time, whereas, spot purchasers are subject to dynamically quoted price and lead times. We discuss the potential of dynamic quotation for such environments, various properties of optimal control policies and the optimal mix of contract customers and spot purchasers.</br>
