Title: Dynamic Multi-product Procurement for Global Health<br>Author: Iva Rashkova, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, irashkova.phd2009@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jérémie Gallien<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Motivated by the funding of pharmaceutical procurement programs by the Global Fund, we study the problem of periodic inventory ordering for multiple products subject to a common exogenous disbursement schedule. We minimize expected weighted stockout levels in the presence of random demand and procurement lead times; unmet demand is partially backordered to capture situations ranging from lost sales to full backordering. We derive near-optimal heuristics and discuss related managerial insights.
