<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Decisions for Perishable Products</br><br>Author: Onur Kaya, Asst. Prof., Koc University, Koc University, Eng 206, Sariyer, Istanbul, 34450, Turkey, okaya@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sajjad Rahimi Ghahroodi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We focus on the pricing and inventory decisions for perishable products in a stochastic setting in which the demand is affected with the prices and the freshness of the products. We model this problem through a dynamic programming formulation and determine the optimal inventory and pricing decisions. We prove certain characteristics of the optimal solution and also analyze the effect of different parameters through numerical experiments. This work is supported by Tubitak grant #111M533</br>
