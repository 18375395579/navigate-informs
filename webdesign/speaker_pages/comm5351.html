<br>Title: Using Dynamic Assortments to Induce Purchases from Strategic Consumers</br><br>Author: Fernando Bernstein, Professor, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Box 90120, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, fernando.bernstein@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victor Martínez de Albéniz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Retailers of short-life-cycle products update their offerings periodically to induce frequent visits to their stores. These in-season introductions are well-known by consumers. We provide a model of decision making for designing dynamic assortments when customers are forward-looking and may substitute consumption across periods. We show that myopic customers always make their purchase earlier than strategic customers. We next explore the retailer's optimal assortment rotation policy.</br>
