Title: The Holdup Problem in Supply Chains<br>Author: Stephen Leider, University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street R4486, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, leider@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Davis<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the holdup problem for capacity investment in a two-stage supply chain with random demand and structured bargaining. After evaluating five different contracts, we find that an option contract mitigates the holdup problem by achieving higher investment levels.  Other contracts (such as a quantity price premium or a quantity commitment), while theoretically able to yield first-best investment levels, yield smaller improvements.
