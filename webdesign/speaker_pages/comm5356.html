Title: Impact of Inventory on Recommender Systems<br>Author: Emre Demirezen, PhD Candidate, Mays Business School, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, edemirezen@mays.tamu.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a subscription based rental setting where satisfaction of customers depends on the availability of requested products. Hence, it is important for the firms to satisfy as much demand as possible. Recommender systems are typically used to help customers that suit their tastes best. However, they can be utilized to shift demand among products by considering inventory levels, and future demand and returns. We address this issue and present several useful managerial insights.
