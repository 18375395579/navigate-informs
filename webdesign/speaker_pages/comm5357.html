<br>Title: Value of Considering Service-Sensitive Demand in Customer Acceptance Decisions</br><br>Author: Serhan Duran, Graduate Research Assistant, School of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, gtg865i@mail.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Julie Swann, Altan Gulcu, Pinar Keskinocak</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We investigate a manufacturer's customer acceptance decisions when past performance in meeting quoted leadtimes affects the future arrivals of customers. We focus on finite capacity under an industry-dictated leadtime. We investigate the conditions under which the optimal accept decision is structured with respect to service level. We compare the manufacturer's profit from the service-savvy policy to one in which a manufacturer is ignorant of the impact of past performance.</br>
