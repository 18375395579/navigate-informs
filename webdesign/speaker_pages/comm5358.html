In early 2006, SBC was struggling with a perishability rate of around 20%. We study demand and supply processes of SBC. Through a set of improvements on collection schedule, contract execution, and operational inefficiencies we decrease the perishability rate to 13%. We focus on the incentive misalignment between SBC and hospitals that it serves to study general contracting issues on platelets.</br>
