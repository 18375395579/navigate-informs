Title: Design of an Aggregated Marketplace under Congestion Effects: Asymptotic Analysis and Equilibrium Characterization<br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, United States of America, chen@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gustavo Vulcano, Costis Maglaras<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study an aggregated marketplace where potential buyers arrive and submit requests-for-quotes (RFQs). We characterize the asymptotic performance of this system, and subsequently extract insights about the equilibrium behavior of the suppliers. We show that supplier competition results into a mixed-strategy equilibrium phenomenon and is significantly different from the centralized solution. We propose a compensation-while-idling mechanism that coordinates the system.
