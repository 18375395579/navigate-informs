Title: Competing Manufacturers in a Retail Supply Chain: On Contractual Form and Coordination<br>Author: Gerard Cachon, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut St., JMHH Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, cachon@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gurhan Kok<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Retailers commonly sell products from competing manufacturers. How then should firms manage their contract negotiations? The supply chain coordination literature focuses either on a single manufacturer selling to a single retailer or one manufacturer selling to many (possibly competing) retailers. We find that some key conclusions from those market structures do not apply in our setting - manufacturers may prefer wholesale-price contracts over sophisticated coordinating contracts.
