Title: A Capacitated Supplier Prioritizing Asymmetric Retailers<br>Author: Zohar Strinka, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, zstrinka@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edwin Romeijn, Christopher Tang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a capacitated supplier and a set of asymmetric retailers. The retailers are assumed to have complete information, face newsvendor-type costs due to uncertain demand, and have a common exogenous selling price. The supplier solicits bids of a per-unit price and order quantity from each retailer, and then allocates the fixed capacity based on those bids. We show structural properties of equilibrium solutions for two retailers when the highest bid receives highest priority.
