Title: Networked Bargaining and Endogenous Fluctuations<br>Author: Thanh Nguyen, Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL, United States of America, t-nguyen@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study how local bargaining in a networked market can cause fluctuations by a new approach that incorporates non-cooperative bargaining into networked economy.  In particular, we consider a bargaining game that captures trade with intermediaries and define its replications. We examine the agents?behavior in the limit as the population size goes to infinity. We show that stationary equilibria need not exist even when market gets large. Thus, in our setting the underlying network is a friction that hinders stationary markets.
