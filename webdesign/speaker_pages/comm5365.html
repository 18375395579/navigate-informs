Taking a combined data-driven and structural approach, the paper focuses on the relationship between pricing decisions and marketplace visibility. We find a strong visibility effect of top ranked charts displayed in the marketplace. Thus motivated, we study a dynamic pricing model and find that this effect supports price cycles, a commonly observed pricing technique in the market.
