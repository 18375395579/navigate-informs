Title: Trading Wind Power Optimally as a Price-making Agent in the Balancing Market<br>Author: Marco Zugno, Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, Kgs. Lyngby, Denmark, mazu@dtu.dk<br>Coauthor(s): Pierre Pinson, Henrik Madsen, Juan Miguel Morales<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In the state-of-the-art, wind power producers are always seen as price-takers. In contrast, we determine the optimal bid in the forward market (first-stage decision), considering the impact on prices of the energy exchange in the balancing market (recourse decision). Such a price-maker relationship is modeled as a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), formulated as a MIP, while the uncertainty in wind power output and market quantities is accounted for by using scenarios.
