<br>Title: Empirical Analysis of Inventory Display Strategies in Retail</br><br>Author: Santiago Gallino, The Wharton School, 3720 Walnut St, Philadelphia, 19104, United States of America, sgallino@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antonio Moreno-Garcia, Marshall Fisher</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: When making decisions about inventory management, managers must determine how inventory affects demand. In this paper, we are interested in studying how inventories affect demand beyond the availability effect. We propose a series of field experiments at retail locations to estimate the effect of inventory on demand. Our objective is to identify groups of items for which the inventory displayed has an effect on demand.</br>
