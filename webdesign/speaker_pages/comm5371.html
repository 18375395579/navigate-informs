Title: Profit-charging Market Makers with Bounded Loss, Vanishing Bid/Ask Spreads, and Unlimited Depth<br>Author: Tuomas Sandholm, Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Dept, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, sandholm@cs.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Abe Othman<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: It was an open question whether a market maker can simultaneously satisfy bounded loss, the ability to make a profit, a vanishing bid/ask spread, and unlimited market depth. We design market makers that do. We achieve this by introducing a practical framework that extends constant-utility cost functions with two functions that are added to the prices quoted to the trader: the liquidity function uses its proceeds to increase the liquidity, and the profit function is a “lockbox?of savings.
