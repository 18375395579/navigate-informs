Title: Bias and Adjustment in Censored and Uncensored Newsvendor Environments<br>Author: David Drake, INSEAD, Blvd de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, david.drake@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nils Rudi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We disambiguate the impact of behavioral order bias and order variation, defining the former as the average deviation from the risk-neutral, profit-maximizing solution and the latter as adjustments from this average. We conduct an experiment to explore the impact of these two sources of profit erosion in censored and uncensored newsvendor environments, finding the magnitude of profit erosion attributable to order variation exceeded that due to order bias in three out of four of our conditions.
