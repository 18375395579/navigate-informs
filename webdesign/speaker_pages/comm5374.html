<br>Title: Revenue Management by Sequential Screening</br><br>Author: Mustafa Akan, Assistant Professor of Operations and Manufacturing Management, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, m-akan@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Baris Ata, James Dana</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a dynamic model of revenue management with strategic, i.e. forward looking, consumers who are heterogeneous and learn their valuations sequentially over time. Business travelers learn their true valuations after leisure travelers. A monopolist system manager maximizes profits by sequentially screening consumers. Using a mechanism design approach, we show that the optimal mechanism is a menu of expiring refund contracts and identify when the first-best solution can be achieved.</br>
