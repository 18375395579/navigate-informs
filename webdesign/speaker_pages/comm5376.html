Title: Vertical De-Integration in the Supply Chain: Selling the Retailer’s Factory<br>Author: Candace Yano, Professor, University of California, Industrial Engineering and OR, Haas School of Business, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, yano@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elizabeth Durango-Cohen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many large grocery chains own factories that produce their store-brand products, and they often wonder whether they should sell the factories to a third party that would operate the factories for them.  We investigate this issue in situations where store-brand and national-brand products compete at the retail level.  We discuss the impact on equilibrium prices, as well as on the retailer’s profit, and the impact of capacity constraints on the nature of competition in this context.
