Title: A Game Theoretic Approach to Funding Liquidity Modeling<br>Author: Andrey Krishenik, Cornell University, 222 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, ak757@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Johannes Wissel, Andreea Minca<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the liquidity position of a financial institution that funds its operations through short term debt in a multi period setting: in each period creditors observe the company's P&L and decide on the amount they invest. Creditors make their decisions based on the P&L process. Our results show that there exists a liquidity barrier, such that, in all Nash equilibria, if the liquidity position falls below this barrier, there will be a run by short term creditors, that will lead to illiquidity.
