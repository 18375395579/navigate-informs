Title: Supplier Competition in Retail Supply Chains<br>Author: Gurhan Kok, Duke University, One Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, United States, gurhan.kok@duke.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A retailer determines the stocking quantities of several competing products that are provided by different suppliers. Each supplier can offer better contract terms to the retailer in order to increase the stocking quantity of her product. We study the competition between the suppliers under different types of contracts and report its impact on contractual terms and the profits of each party involved.
