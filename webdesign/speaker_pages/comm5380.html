Title: Make Today the Best It Can Be: Channel Dynamics in Durable Product Pricing and Distribution<br>Author: Wei-yu Kevin Chiang, City University of Hong Kong, Department of Management Sciences, Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, wchiang@cityu.edu.hk<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: When a manufacturer and its retailer are involved in setting prices in distributing a product over time, not only do they inter-temporally compete against themselves, but they also compete against each other to maximize their benefits. This study develops a dynamic game to investigate the traditional channel interaction problem in an inter-temporal setting. Surprisingly, both channel members can be more profitable when they are myopic, rather than forward-looking, in setting prices.
