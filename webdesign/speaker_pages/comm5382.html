Component capacities are chosen prior to the selling season, and the common component is allocated to the products based on observed demands. We propose a collection of allocation mechanisms involving varying degrees of demand aggregation and explore the impact of the allocation scheme and customer impatience on sales, pro&#64257;ts, and capacity decisions.</br>
