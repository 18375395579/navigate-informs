Title: Markups in Network Pricing<br>Author: Nicolas Stier-Moses, Columbia Business School, Uris 418, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, ns2224@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jose Rafael Correa<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a game in which producers adopt price functions proportional to their production costs by deciding which markups to charge. In a second phase, consumers learn the producers' price functions, which leads to an allocation of consumers to producers. We look at characteristics of the resulting equilibrium and show that its social cost is close to that of the optimal allocation. In particular, we study the worst-case inefficiency as a function of the competitiveness of the marketplace.
