Title: Early Commitment Strategies Under Capacity Competition<br>Author: Ismail Bakal, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, ismailsb@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Geunes<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the implications of early-commitment strategies when retailers compete for supplier capacity under demand uncertainty. Specifically, we investigate a supply chain with multiple retailers and a single supplier where one of the retailers is the primary customer of the supplier. We compare the expected supplier and retailer profits under each of these strategies and specify conditions under which the early commitment scheme benefits the supplier and/or the primary retailer.
