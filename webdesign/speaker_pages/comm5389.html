<br>Title: Structural Properties of Buyback Contracts for Price-Setting Newsvendors</br><br>Author: Saibal Ray, Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, H3A1G5, Canada, Saibal.Ray@McGill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shanling Li, Yuyue Song</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies a buyback contract in the Stackelberg framework of a manufacturer selling to a price-setting,  newsvendor retailer. Using an analytical model which focuses on a multiplicative demand form, we generalize previous  results and produce new structural insights. We identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the  optimal contract to be distribution-free, and for a no-buyback contract to be optimal from the manufacturer's perspective.</br>
