Title: Signaling Value Of Trade Credit<br>Author: Pierre-Yves Brunet, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, brunetp@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Volodymyr Babich<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Start-up firms, denied bank loans because banks are uncertain about creditworthiness of the firms, benefit from trade credit financing because it allows them to implement their production decisions in the current period and because it signals their credit quality to the banks.  Using a multi-period model for the operations of the firm, we study joint procurement and financing decisions, characterize properties of the optimal policy, and compute the signaling value of trade credit financing.
