<br>Title: Discounted Referral Pricing between Healthcare Networks</br><br>Author: Fernanda Bravo, Ph.D. Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 100 Main Street, E62-459, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, fbravo@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Angela King, Gonzalo Romero, Retsef Levi, Georgia Perakis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Academic medical centers (AMC) receive referrals from low acuity networks, and usually use a fee for service contract. We consider referrals from a capitated provider (HMO), and characterize a two-tier discount contract. Our contract is mutually beneficial based on both parties?risk preferences: it increases the AMC’s expected revenue while decreasing the HMO’s conditional value at risk of the cost.  We extend the analysis to the case of asymmetric information about referral volume.</br>
