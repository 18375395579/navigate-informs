We consider referrals from a capitated provider (HMO), and characterize a two-tier discount contract. Our contract is mutually beneficial based on both parties?risk preferences: it increases the AMC’s expected revenue while decreasing the HMO’s conditional value at risk of the cost.  We extend the analysis to the case of asymmetric information about referral volume.
