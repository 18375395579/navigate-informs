<br>Title: Integrating Inventory Replenishment and Trade Credit in One-Warehouse-Multi-Retailers System</br><br>Author: Chung Piaw Teo, Professor, National University of Singapore, Mochtar Riady Building, BIZ1-7-71, 15 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore, 119245, Singapore, bizteocp@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mabel Chou, Yuanguang Zhong</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We use the classical echelon inventory approach to synthesize the effects of trade credits in a one-warehouse-multi-retailer system. We obtain a closed form  (but non convex) expression for the total supply chain cost. Interestingly, we  show that longer credit terms from the external supplier may not necessarily translates into longer credit  terms for the retailers in some supply chain environments.</br>
