Title: Repeated Distributive Negotiations: How Expectations of Future Transactions Impact Present Behaviors<br>Author: Haresh Gurnani, Professor, University of Miami, Dept of Management, Coral Gables, FL, 33124, United States of America, hgurnani@bus.miami.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Rajesh Bagchi, Shweta Oza, Mahesh Nagarajan<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study repeat distributive negotiations to analyze how negotiator’s role (buyer vs. seller) and expectation of role reversal in future affects current negotiation. Implications for supply chains are discussed. In three studies we find that with role reversal, transactions are coupled with greater concessions now in anticipation of future recovery. With role reversal, negotiators believe that opponents will make larger concessions in future as they feel that the negotiator would do the same.
