Liu, Adam Wierman, Zichao Yang<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper proposes a model to capture a marketplace with users purchasing services from Software-as-Service (SaaS) providers, which in turn purchase computing resources from either Provider-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers.  We define and characterize market equilibria. Further, we use these characterizations to study the profitability of SaaSs and PaaSs/IaaSs, and to understand the impact of price competition on user experienced performance.
