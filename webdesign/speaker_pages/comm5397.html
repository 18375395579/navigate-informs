The quality level of the product is directly proportional with the improvement effort (e.g. fertilization) during the cultivation phase and the price of the end-product changes accordingly with farmers' efforts. We analyze the problem and develop pricing mechanisms that coordinate the system and induce farmers' to invest in the same level of effort with the centralized system.</br>
