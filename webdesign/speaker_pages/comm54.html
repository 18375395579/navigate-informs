Title: The Impact of Licensing on Open Source and Proprietary Software Competition<br>Author: Wei Chen, University of California-San Diego, Rady School of Management, San Diego, CA, United States of America, Wei.Chen@rady.ucsd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Terrence August, Kevin Zhu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Open source licensing is an important device that coordinates the co-creation of open source software. This paper studies how the restrictiveness of an open source license affects both an open source originator’s and subsequent contributor’s development incentives when a strong proprietary vendor competes in the same market. We characterize how the aggregate impact of license restrictiveness is influenced by competitive forces.
