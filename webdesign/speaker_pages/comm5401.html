Title: Waiting Till the Last Minute: Strategic or Irrational?<br>Author: Xuanming Su, Assistant Professor, University of California, Haas School of Business, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, xuanming@haas.berkeley.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consumers often wait until the last minute before making a purchase. This indicates strategic behavior if they can secure a last-minute discount. Yet, consumers sometimes wait even when this implies higher prices and lower availability. We adopt a behavioral approach towards this phenomenon and study its implications on dynamic pricing strategies.
