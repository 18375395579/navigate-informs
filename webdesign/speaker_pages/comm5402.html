Title: Leveraging Future Cost Reductions: A Dynamic Two-Sided Pricing Model<br>Author: Xiajun Amy Pan, University of Florida, United States of America, amypan@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mei Lin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Technology innovation engenders new products of higher qualities and reduces production costs. We study how a firm leverages future cost reductions to position its product line toward the high-end in both buyer-side only and two-sided markets. We find that future cost reductions raise the optimal price of the current device and trigger an intertemporal buyer-side demand shift forward.
