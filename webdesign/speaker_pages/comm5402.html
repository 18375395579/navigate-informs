<br>Title: Leveraging Future Cost Reductions: A Dynamic Two-Sided Pricing Model</br><br>Author: Xiajun Amy Pan, University of Florida, United States of America, amypan@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mei Lin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Technology innovation engenders new products of higher qualities and reduces production costs.

We find that future cost reductions raise the optimal price of the current device and trigger an intertemporal buyer-side demand shift forward.</br>
