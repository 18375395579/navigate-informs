<br>Title: The Cost of Anarchy in Self-Commitment Based Electricity Markets</br><br>Author: Ramteen Sioshansi, Graduate Student, IEOR Department, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1777, United States, ramteen@queue.IEOR.Berkeley.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard O'Neill, Shmuel Oren</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We compare the efficiency and distributional implications of centralized unit commitment based on multipart offers in competitive day-ahead electricity markets to a self-commitment approach with one part energy offers. In the centralized approach generators are paid hourly marginal energy clearing prices plus a daily make-whole payment to cover revenue shortfalls. Under self-commitment, all costs are covered by energy payments based on hourly marginal clearing prices.</br>
