Title: Wholesale Pricing under Fairness Concerns<br>Author: Julie Niederhoff, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, United States of America, jniederh@syr.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Modeling analysis shows that, under fairness-based utility functions, the un-coordinated system is maximized if the supplier is generously fair-minded while the retailer is spiteful.  Through a series of controlled experiments we consider these analytical predictions to study how suppliers set wholesale prices and how retailers set inventory levels in a newsvendor setting.
