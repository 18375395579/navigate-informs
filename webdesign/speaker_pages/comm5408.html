Title: Investing in Supplier Capacity: Cost-sharing Mechanisms and Experimental Tests<br>Author: Shanshan Hu, Indiana University, Kelley School of Business, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, hush@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhixi Wan, Qing Ye, Wei Chi<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Taking a buyer's perspective, we investigate if simple cost-sharing mechanisms can induce capacity investment from competing suppliers. We show that linear-sharing mechanism can achieve this goal but reduces the buyer's profit, and this short-coming can be overcome by a modified target-sharing mechanism. Experiment studies confirm our theoretical predictions.
