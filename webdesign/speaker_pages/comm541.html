Each channel faces a newsvendor problem, with price and order quantity as decision variables. A unique equilibrium is provided for the system. We propose a modified revenue sharing contract to enable supply chain coordination. We use numerical tests to answer when the manufacturer should delay sales at the outlet store.</br>
