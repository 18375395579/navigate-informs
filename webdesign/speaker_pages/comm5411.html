<br>Title: Intertemporal Price Discrimination: Structure and Computation of Optimal Policies</br><br>Author: Ilan Lobel, New York University, 44 West Fourth Street, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, ilobel@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Omar Besbes</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of a firm selling goods over time to customers with heterogeneous patience levels. We let customer valuations be correlated with their willingness-to-wait and look for a dynamic pricing policy that maximizes the long-term revenue of the firm.  We prove several structural properties of the optimal pricing policy and develop a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal policy in polynomial time.</br>
