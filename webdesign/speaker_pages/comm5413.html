Title: Transmission Investment under Uncertainty: The Case of Germany-Norway<br>Author: Stein-Erik Fleten, Associate Professor, Norwegian U of Sci and Tech, Dept Industrial Economics and Tech Mgm, Trondheim, MI, NO-7491, Norway, stein-erik.fleten@iot.ntnu.no<br>Coauthor(s): Afzal Siddiqui, Ane Marte Heggedal<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Price differences between neighboring regions and countries motivate in part the construction of large transmission lines. Analysis of such investment is complicated by the fact that the electricity can flow in both directions, by uncertainty in exchange rates and prices, and not least by the fact that the price differences become smaller after the transmission line has been put into operation. We perform a real options analysis of a merchant investor holding an exclusive license to build.
