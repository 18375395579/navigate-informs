In this presentation we use an axiomatic approach to explore the impact of product variety on customer demand, product price, system revenue and inventory levels. These results are applied to two supply chains. The first is a decentralized multi-retailer system where each retailer sells a single product and retailers compete on price. The second supply chain is a single retailer selling multiple competitive products. We use the insight from our analysis to answer the question of whether more consumer choices is better for the customers or the seller.</br>
