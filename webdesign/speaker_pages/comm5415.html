<br>Title: Strategy-proofness, Investment Efficiency, and Marginal Returns: An Equivalence</br><br>Author: John Hatfield, Stanford University, Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, CA, United States of America, hatfield_john@gsb.stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fuhito Kojima, Scott Kominers</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Suppose agents make pre-market investment choices before participating in a centralized market mechanism. We show that a mechanism in this setting induces agent i to make efficient investment choices if and only if that mechanism also rewards agent i with his marginal surplus. For an efficient mechanism, this is equivalent to strategy-proofness for i. We show that workers are incentivized to make efficient human capital investments before entering the labor market, eliminating hold-up problems.</br>
