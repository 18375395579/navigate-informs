Title: Analyzing the Effect of Inspection Mechanisms on Investments in Remanufacturing used Products of Uncertain Quality<br>Author: Andrea Robotis, HEC School of Management, Paris, robotis@hec.fr<br>Coauthor(s): Tamer Boyaci, Vedat Verter<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a 2-period setting where in Period 1 a monopolist decides the remanufacturability level of a product in addition to the number of products to be collected in Period 2. The quality condition of the collected products is uncertain. The collected products have to be inspected before they are remanufactured. We characterize the optimal investment levels and we show that the effect of uncertainty may or may not be detrimental depending on the inspection mechanism that is used.
