Title: Implications of Product Lifecycle and Channel Structure Upon Optimal Investment in Durability<br>Author: Sreekumar Bhaskaran, Assistant Professor, Southern Methodist University, COX Business School, 389 Crow, Dallas, TX, 75275, United States, sbhaskar@cox.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Steve Gilbert<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate how the use of intermediaries in the channel of  distribution affects a manufacturer's investment in the durability of a product. Depending upon the product and technology life-cycles, the  nature production technology and manufacturing costs, we find that a  manufacturer can have an incentive to invest more in durability when he sells through intermediaries than when he sells directly.
