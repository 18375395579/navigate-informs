Title: Managing Risk in Alternative Energy Product Development<br>Author: Geoffrey Parker, Associate Professor, Tulane University, Freeman School of Business, New Orleans, LA, 70118, United States, gparker@tulane.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Edward Anderson<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Developing alternative energy products is inherently risky because of the volatile nature of oil prices.  This volatility stems from: (1) Cycles in oil exploration, and (2) Information asymmetry because energy firms with access to the most fruitful sites for discovery of new reserves may be underestimating them due to technological or geopolitical factors.  This leads us to discuss the impact of these price risks on alternative energy product development and how these risks might be mitigated.
