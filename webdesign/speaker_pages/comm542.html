This volatility stems from: (1) Cycles in oil exploration, and (2) Information asymmetry because energy firms with access to the most fruitful sites for discovery of new reserves may be underestimating them due to technological or geopolitical factors.  This leads us to discuss the impact of these price risks on alternative energy product development and how these risks might be mitigated.</br>
