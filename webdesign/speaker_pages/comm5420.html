Title: Provisioning of Large Scale Systems: The Role of Network Effects and Anarchy in the User Base<br>Author: Jayakrishnan Nair, Caltech, 1200 E. California Blvd., Pasadena, CA, 91125, United States of America, ujk@caltech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Adam Wierman, Bert Zwart<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of capacity provisioning for an advertising-supported online service by analyzing the strategic interaction between the service provider and the user base. We show that stronger positive network effects and non-cooperation in the user base drive the service into a more congested state, leading to increased profit for the service provider. However, the impact of non-cooperation, or `anarchy' in the user base strongly dominates the impact of network effects.
