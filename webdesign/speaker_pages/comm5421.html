Title: Demand Allocation Under Supply Uncertainty<br>Author: Jianli Hu, Assistant Professor, Chapman University, One University Dr., Orange, CA, 92620, United States, jhu@chapman.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mihaela Vajiac<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The optimal choice in an environment with multiple potential suppliers is closely related to the tradeoffs between the respective aspects of direct purchasing costs and supplier performance.  In this paper we present a decision model that optimizes the allocation of demand across multiple unreliable supply sources.  Our approach integrates supplier costs, supplier reliabilities, demand uncertainty, initial inventory and firm specific inventory costs.
