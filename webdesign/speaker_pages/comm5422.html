Title: The Anarchy of Price Competition<br>Author: Amr Farahat, Cornell University, 370 Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, farahat@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the effects of price competition, compared to centralized pricing, on industry profits and total surplus in differentiated oligopolies. The products are gross substitutes, the number of firms is arbitrary, and the demand model is a nonnegative extension of the affine function. We provide sharp bounds on the ratio of decentralized to centralized profits that are independent of marginal costs and we prove that the loss of efficiency due to competition is no more than 25%.
