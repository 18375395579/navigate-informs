Title: Optimal Allocation of Local Exclusivity Rights<br>Author: Changrong Deng, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, United States of America, changrong.deng@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sasa Pekec<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Multiple identical items are being sold to unit-demand buyers in a network. Buyers are willing to pay a premium if they obtain the item exclusively in their neighborhood. We solve the revenue maximizing mechanism design problem for locally linear exclusivity valuations. We discuss the complexity of the problem and the non-monotonicity of the optimal seller revenues in buyers' valuations. We also present an ascending auction implementation of the optimal mechanism for the clique.
