<br>Title: Static versus Contingent Pricing under Duopoly Competition</br><br>Author: Zizhuo Wang, Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford, United States of America, zzwang@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ming Hu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We compare static versus contingent pricing schemes in a competitive environment. We find that using a static pricing policy could alleviate the cut-throat price competition if demand turns out to be slack. This gain could outweigh the loss of not being able to exploit high demand turnout when it realizes. For a simple model, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which a static pricing policy achieves higher revenue. Numerical tests are performed to illustrate our results.</br>
