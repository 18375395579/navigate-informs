Title: Static versus Contingent Pricing under Duopoly Competition<br>Author: Zizhuo Wang, Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford, United States of America, zzwang@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ming Hu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We compare static versus contingent pricing schemes in a competitive environment. We find that using a static pricing policy could alleviate the cut-throat price competition if demand turns out to be slack. This gain could outweigh the loss of not being able to exploit high demand turnout when it realizes. For a simple model, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which a static pricing policy achieves higher revenue. Numerical tests are performed to illustrate our results.
