We study a multi-period order allocation problem of a buyer sourcing from unreliable suppliers which reduce production cost over time through learning. By considering supply disruption risk and learning, we analyze the trade-off between risk reduction via multiple sourcing and learning benefits induced by long-term relationships with a single supplier.</br>
