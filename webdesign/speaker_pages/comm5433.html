Title: Competitive Food Supply Chain Networks with Application to Fresh Produce<br>Author: Min Yu, University of Portland, 5000 N Willamette Blvd., Portland, OR, 97203, United States of America, yu@up.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Anna Nagurney<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We developed a network-based food supply chain model under oligopolistic competition and perishability. We captured the food deterioration along the entire supply chain, as well as the disposal of the spoiled food products. We allowed for product differentiation due to product freshness and food safety concerns, as well as the evaluation of alternative technologies. A case study focused on the cantaloupe market was investigated, in which we analyzed the impact of a foodborne disease outbreak.
