The firms compete over price and fulfillment rate, which is  different from the classical quantity-price game.  We consider this game under different make-to-order and make-to-stock  scenarios and show existence and uniqueness of equilibria. We also provide a characterization of the optimization problem of each firm in the form of a general newsvendor problem with piecewise-linear overage and underage costs.</br>
