Title: A Stochastic Dynamic Model to Optimize the Promotions Period in Airlines<br>Author: Daniel Felipe Otero Leon, Instructor, Universidad de los Andes, Cra 1 No 18a - 10 of ML-334, Bogota, Colombia, df.otero128@uniandes.edu.co<br>Coauthor(s): Raha Akhavan-Tabatabaei, Cristina López Garzón<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Promotions help increment the demand for a flight. Several decisions have to be made to offer a promotion such as the price and when and for how long to offer it. The problem of fixing the price is extensively discussed, unlike the problem that given a fixed promotional price, when and for how long it should be offered. We propose a stochastic dynamic model to maximize the revenue, by evaluating the decision of whether or not to offer the promotion, taking into account the effects of dilution.
