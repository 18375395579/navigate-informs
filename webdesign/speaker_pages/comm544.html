Title: Public Innovation and Commercial Entrepreneurship in Nascent Software Markets<br>Author: Jon Eckhardt, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, jeckhardt@wisc.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper empirically examines in a sample of over one million transactions if the effect innovations have on a focal commercial product depends on whether innovators pursue financial incentives or not. I predict that innovations that are shared by individuals who are not guided by market incentives will increase the sales of commercial products. Conversely, due to competition products created for commercial purposes will decrease the sale of other commercial producers.
