Title: Outsourcing Remanufacturing Operations: Cost Benefits or Potential Competition?<br>Author: Eda Kemahlioglu-Ziya, Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina, CB # 3490, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States, Eda_KemahliogluZiya@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gokce Esenduran, Jay Swaminathan<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider an OEM manufacturing a product, 100% of which must be recollected at the end of its life cycle due to legislature. The product can be refurbished and resold in the market; however the OEM does not have remanufacturing capabilities. The OEM can either dispose of the cores at cost or sell them to a third-party manufacturer, who becomes their competitor in the market. We are interested in analyzing whether the cost benefits of selling the cores outweigh the loss to competition.
