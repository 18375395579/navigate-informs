<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing with Random Replenishment Capacity</br><br>Author: Jian Li, Associate Professor, Northeastern Illinois University, 5500 N. St. Louis Ave, Chicago, IL, 60625, United States of America, j-li3@neiu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaowei Xu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this research, we study the decision problem facing a retailer who sells a short seasonal product inventory in a stylized model. The retailer has an uncertain second chance to refill its inventory. We analytically derive the structure of the optimal dynamic pricing policy and procurement decisions. We also explore the properties of the optimal dynamic pricing and the expected profit function.</br>
