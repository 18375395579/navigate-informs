<br>Title: Autonomous Retail Electricity Trading: Strategies and Economic Benefits</br><br>Author: Markus Peters, PhD Candidate, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, 3062PA, Netherlands, peters@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wolf Ketter, John Collins</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Sustainable energy systems need new forms of coordinating between demand and supply from renewable and traditional sources. The Power TAC platform helps researchers understand the dynamics of retail electricity markets, and it provides a laboratory for testing new coordination strategies. We analyze strategies proposed by the Power TAC community, give insights into success factors for competitive retail electricity markets, and take steps towards a design theory for retail electricity brokers.</br>
