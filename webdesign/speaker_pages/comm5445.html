Title: Energy Supply Risk Due to Selling Over the Physical Generation Capacity<br>Author: Anderson Rodrigo de Queiroz, PhD, MC&E, Rua Silvestre Ferraz N.81, Itajub? 37500-000, Brazil, ar_queiroz@yahoo.com.br<br>Coauthor(s): Jos?W.

This work explores the possibility of financial leverage in terms of energy by allowing the negotiation of contracts that extrapolates the physical capacity. Short-term price simulations are used to value contracts and to study risk. The procedure gives more flexibility and liquidity to the market amplifying the business possibilities.
