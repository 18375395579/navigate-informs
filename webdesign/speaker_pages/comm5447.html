The firms procure the commodity as well as sell excess inventory through either the spot or the forward market. The firms also share the commodity. We characterize the firms?equilibrium procurement policies. We show inventory sharing is always beneficial. We numerically find that the option to share inventory may either increase or decrease the firms?optimal inventory levels.</br>
