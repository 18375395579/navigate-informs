<br>Title: A Closed-loop Approach to Dynamic Assortment Planning</br><br>Author: Victor Martínez de Albéniz, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, Av. Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, Valbeniz@iese.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Esra Cinar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Firms offering short-lived products are constantly trying to keep the customers interested by refreshing their assortments. We model these dynamics by assuming that products lose their attractiveness over time and we let the firm enhance the assortment at a cost, e.g., with new product introductions. We characterize the optimal closed-loop policy that maximizes the revenue obtained by increasing the attractiveness of an assortment, minus the associated cost of the adjustments.</br>
