Experimental Study</br><br>Author: Nikolay Osadchiy, Assistant Professor, Emory University, Robert Goizueta Business School, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, nikolay.osadchiy@emory.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elliot Bendoly</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Novel retail selling mechanisms involve a tradeoff between buying now vs later at a lower price. Recreating this setting in a laboratory, we observe a substantial fraction of subjects making decisions consistent with expected utility maximization. We find that subjects are particularly sensitive to whether the information about riskiness of the buy-later option is provided. Implications for revenue management are discussed.</br>
