We look at the cases, such as in durable goods markets, where consumers are strategic about when they purchase. We propose a constrained optimization formulation that minimizes the GMM objective function subject to the constraints that Bellman’s equation is satisfied at all consumer states and that the market share equations hold. We discuss numerical results from Monte Carlo experiments.</br>
