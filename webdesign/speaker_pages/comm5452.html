We evaluate the retailer's optimal order quantity and the creditors' optimal credit limits and interest rates in two scenarios. We further analytically prove that the relationship between bank and trade credits, and then empirically validate this prediction based on a panel of 674 firms in China over the period 2001--2007.</br>
