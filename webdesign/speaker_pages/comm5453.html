Given high competition over the Internet to attract users, a question that arises is whether OSMs should reward their contributing users. We model this competition by a duopoly game where users are either active or passive with respect to each OSM. We show this game has a unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies and specify how OSMs derive the optimal reward payments.</br>
