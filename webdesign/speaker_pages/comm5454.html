<br>Title: Improving Supplier Yield with Spillover Risk</br><br>Author: Yixuan Xiao, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States of America, xiaoy@wustl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nan Yang, Yimin Wang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study manufacturers?supplier improvement efforts with spillover risk. We consider two manufacturers compete in the same market and share a common supplier, which has a production process that is subject to random yield. We model the competition between manufacturers as a two-stage game, and characterize its equilibrium.</br>
