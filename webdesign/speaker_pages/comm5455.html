Title: Integrating Inventory Replenishment and Cash Payment Decisions in Supply Chains<br>Author: Wei Luo, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, United States of America, wei.luo@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Shang<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We provide a modeling framework that integrates financial flows into a two-stage supply chain where each location procures inventory based on cash available.  We consider different payment schemes and derive joint optimal and near-optimal inventory and cash policies. Our study demonstrates that an effective cash payment policy can mitigate the supply disruption risk and improve the overall supply chain efficiency.
