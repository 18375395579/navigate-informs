Title: Impact of Product Variety on Manufacturing Complexity in Automobile Mixed-Model Assembly<br>Author: Xiaowei Zhu, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan, 2415 Laurelwood Circle, Ann Arbor, MI, 48108, United States, xwzhu@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): S. Jack Hu, Yoram Koren<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Automobile mixed-model assembly lines become very complex when the number of product variants is large, which, in turn, may impact quality and productivity. The paper considers the variety induced manufacturing complexity in manual assembly lines where operators must make choices in assembly. A complexity measure is proposed, and models are developed to evaluate the complexity at each station, then for the entire line. Complexity can be minimized by making systems design and operation decisions.
