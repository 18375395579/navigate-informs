Title: Procurement Mechanism Design in a Two-echelon Inventory System with Price-dependent Demand<br>Author: Fuqiang Zhang, Assistant Professor, Washington University, Olin Business School, St. Louis, MO, United States of America, FZhang22@wustl.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: A buyer procures a product from an upstream supplier and in turn sells to customers. Both firms can hold inventory to improve service. The buyer takes two attributes into consideration when designing the procurement contract: price attribute and service-level attribute. We derive the optimal contract for the buyer and investigate the implications of the two attributes on procurement mechanism design.
