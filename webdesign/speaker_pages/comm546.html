Title: Dynamic Pricing for Consumer Lending<br>Author: Roger R. Gung, Director, Research, Response Analytics, Inc., 7426 E Stetson Dr., Ste 120, Scottsdale, AZ, 85251, United States of America, roger.gung@responseanalytics.com<br>Coauthor(s): Frank Bria, Tao Kang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The dynamic nature of consumer lending is prompting the shift from rate sheet pricing to dynamic pricing. Dynamic pricing, as defined in this talk, includes differential pricing based on deal and buyer attributes, and flexible-pricing for product preferences and price negotiation. We present our new solution method to dynamic pricing in the context of auto lending, including price elasticity modeling and profit optimization. We also discuss the pitfall of using rate sheet for price negotiation.
