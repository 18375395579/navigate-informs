We propose and analyze several dynamic contracts that adjust sharing proportions based on the changing state of the system.  Framing a two-airline alliance as a finite-horizon Markov game, we find the equilibrium policies for each contract. We compare revenues under these policies with those under static proration contracts and with those of a centralized controller, providing insight into when each performs well.</br>
