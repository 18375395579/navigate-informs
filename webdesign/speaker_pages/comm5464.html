To understand the intertemporal effects, this paper estimates a nested logit model in the cruise industry based on descriptive analyses. The results show that the firm is able to use product line pricing to allocate demand across time periods. A policy experiment shows that intertemporal price variation accounts for 18% of revenues relative to optimal product line pricing alone.</br>
