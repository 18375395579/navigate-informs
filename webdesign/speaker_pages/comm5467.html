Title: A Fluid Analysis for Service Capacity Decisions<br>Author: Haiyan Wang, Olin School of Business, Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO, United States, wangha@olin.wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tava Olsen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study capacity decisions in a service environment where  arrival rates are highly seasonal  and  customers are time sensitive.  We begin by studying a  monopolist's capacity decision where the trade off is between the  cost of extra capacity for low demand periods or loss of revenue for  high demand periods.  We then study a duopoly model where lost  demand for one firm may become increased demand for the opponent. In  both models we use a fluid model for the analysis.
