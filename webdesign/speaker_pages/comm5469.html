Title: Optimal Timing of an IT Service Contract Benchmark<br>Author: Ryan Sougstad, Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, 319 19th Ave S., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, sougs002@umn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Robert Kauffman<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: IT service contracts often contain provisions to benchmark and control for market and technology risk. We consider pricing benchmarks initiated at the client’s behest relative to market prices for the vendor services provided. Benchmarking ensures the provider is operating efficiently. We ask: How should a contract participant time the benchmark? We use a value-at-risk model to optimize benchmark timing involving mark-to-market in IT services contract prices. We also quantify the value of a benchmark provision in a contract under conditions of mark-to-market uncertainty.
