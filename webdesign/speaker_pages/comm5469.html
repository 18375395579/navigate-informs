We consider pricing benchmarks initiated at the client’s behest relative to market prices for the vendor services provided. Benchmarking ensures the provider is operating efficiently. We ask: How should a contract participant time the benchmark? We use a value-at-risk model to optimize benchmark timing involving mark-to-market in IT services contract prices. We also quantify the value of a benchmark provision in a contract under conditions of mark-to-market uncertainty.</br>
