Demand is often loosely known as expected demand over some aggregate time interval. Forwarders need to account for the uncertainty in freight demand over the contract period when procuring capacity   from carriers. We develop models for demand over contract period and use these to study capacity procurement and transportation cost for the forwarders.</br>
