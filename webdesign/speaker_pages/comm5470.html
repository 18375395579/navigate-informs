Title: Risk Indifference Pricing in Stochastic Volatility Models<br>Author: Stephan Sturm, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA, 01609, United States of America, ssturm@WPI.EDU<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An appealing approach for pricing derivatives in incomplete markets is to understand prices as reservation prices. We assume that the buyer is indifferent between buying the derivative for the price in question and not buying the derivative at all. We propose an approach that is based on a risk-indifference pricing, that is we calculate a reservation price describing the buyer's indifference in terms of residual risk after hedging the position.
