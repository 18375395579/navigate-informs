Assuming that long term electricity prices follow a Brownian motion dynamics, with parameters estimated by considering forward prices of the Nordic electricity market, the value of the investment flexibility is estimated. Investment decisions and wind power values are discussed in terms of a case study from a Norwegian energy company.</br>
