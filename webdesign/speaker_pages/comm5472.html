Title: Investing in a Wind Farm Under Electricity Price Uncertainty<br>Author: Stein-Erik Fleten, Associate Professor, NTNU Norway, IØT, Alfred Getz v. 3, Trondheim, NO, NO-7491, Norway, stein-erik.fleten@iot.ntnu.no<br>Coauthor(s): Per Christian L Torgersrud, Kim Krossøy, Bernhard Kvaal<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A company holding a license to build a wind farm has the right, but not the obligation, to build a certain capacity of wind power. Assuming that long term electricity prices follow a Brownian motion dynamics, with parameters estimated by considering forward prices of the Nordic electricity market, the value of the investment flexibility is estimated. Investment decisions and wind power values are discussed in terms of a case study from a Norwegian energy company.
