<br>Title: Inventory and Pricing Competition with Strategic Consumers</br><br>Author: Gerard Cachon, Professor of Operations and Information Management, University of Pennsylvania, 543 JMHH, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, cachon@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Swinney</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a model with a retailer selling to consumers, some of whom are strategic. A strategic consumer forms rational expectations regarding prices and availability during a selling season and chooses the optimal time to make a purchase. We study how the presence of strategic consumers influences the retailers quantity and pricing decisions.  We also consider how a retailer performs if the retailer is unaware of the presence of strategic consumers.</br>
