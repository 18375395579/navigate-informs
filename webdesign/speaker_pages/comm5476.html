<br>Title: New Payment Rules in Core-selecting Auctions</br><br>Author: Marissa Beck, Stanford University, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, mrbeck@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Day</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The set of core-selecting auctions is large and previous literature has focused mostly on minimum-revenue core-selecting auctions. We explore alternative “core?pricing rules based on linear item prices and LP duality, but enforcing stricter competitive equilibrium properties. A primal-dual cutting-planes approach is used to strike a balance between the (sometimes infeasible) concept of item prices and the (always obtainable but less intuitive) concept of personalized package prices in the core.</br>
