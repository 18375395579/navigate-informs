Title: Competition in Large Scale Service Systems: Do Waiting Time Standards Matter?<br>Author: Gad Allon, Assistant Professor, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, g-allon@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Itai Gurvich<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study the equilibrium behavior in a market with both small- and large-scale service providers that compete on both price and service level attributes. Applying the epsilon-Nash equilibrium framework to a sequence of markets with growing aggregate demand allows us to identify key properties of these markets. When restricting the demand models under consideration, we show that competition forces the firms to operate in the Quality and Efficiency Driven (QED)   operational regime.
