To make the strategic decision, a firm should consider the consumers?physiological on remanufactured product and the cannibalization of remanufactured product on new product. We investigate the decision drivers of remanufacturing strategies: remanufacture in-house or outsource to a third party, considering two input factors-the difference in the cost efficiency between two strategies and heterogeneous preference of the consumers on new/remanufactured products. We analyze the impact of recycling level under two strategies, which make the recycle rate an endogenous decision variable. In addition, we compare the environmental impact and social welfare of these two strategies.
