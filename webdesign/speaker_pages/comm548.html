<br>Title: Deadline Rush and Task Sharing</br><br>Author: Kenneth Doerr, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, 555 Dyer Road, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, khdoerr@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Nembhard</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Deadline rush is the change in work rate entailed by the presence of a deadline.  Task sharing is the delegation of a task to varying (adjacent) workers according to a workflow policy.  We investigate the impact deadline rush has on task sharing in two kinds of operating systems (quota-based, and asynchronous-paced).  We find that individual differences in deadline reactivity has an impact on the efficacy of task sharing, with a stronger impact in quota-based systems.</br>
