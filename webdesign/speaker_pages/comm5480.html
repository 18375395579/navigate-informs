Title: Advance Purchase Discounts in a Supply Chain<br>Author: Karan Girotra, INSEAD, karan.girotra@insead.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: In this study, we analyze the economics of an advance purchase discount scheme where an upstream tier offers downstream tiers an incentive to place orders well in advance of demand. From observing these advance orders, the upstream tier can infer and utilize the information available to the downstream tier. Such an arrangement leads to efficient risk allocation and productive sharing of information in the supply chain. This leads to Pareto-improving outcomes for all agents.
