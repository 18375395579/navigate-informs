<br>Title: Invest or Exit?  Optimal Decisions in the Face of a Declining Profit Stream</br><br>Author: Dharma Kwon, UCLA Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States, dharma.kwon@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Even in the face of declining and highly volatile demand, firms often  invest in aging technologies rather than discard them. We study this  phenomenon by modeling the firm's profit rate as a Brownian motion  with negative drift.  At each point in time, the firm can (1) continue  operations, (2) stop the project, or (3) boost the profit rate through  one-time investment.  The optimal policy is a threshold rule, and we find a counter-intuitive comparative statics result.</br>
