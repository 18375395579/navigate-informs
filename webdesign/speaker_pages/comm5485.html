Title: Why do Sellers Share Aggregate Inventory Information with Customers?<br>Author: Hyoduk Shin, UC San Diego Rady School of Management, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92093, United States of America, hshin@rady.ucsd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ruomeng Cui<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study why a retailer may share the aggregate inventory information of two products with consumers and when it is optimal to do so. A retailer sells two vertically-differentiated products. The seller might share the aggregate inventory level rather than each version’s separate inventory information with customers. We show that the aggregate inventory information sharing is an ex-post optimal strategy if and only if the price of the high quality product is neither too high nor too low.
