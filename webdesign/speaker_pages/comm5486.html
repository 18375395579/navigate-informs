Title: Maximum Utility Model with Reservation Prices<br>Author: Romy Shioda, Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave West, Waterloo, ON, Canada, rshioda@math.uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Levent Tuncel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the revenue management problem of pricing a product line with several customer segments, working under the assumption that every customer's product choice is determined entirely by their reservation price.  We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer programming problem and develop several heuristics.  We test the practical efficacy of our method, in terms of both computation time and impact on revenue, on customer purchase order data from a tourism company.
