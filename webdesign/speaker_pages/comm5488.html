Title: Dynamic Pricing of Multiple Products in a Segmented Market<br>Author: Chi-Guhn Lee, cglee@mie.utoronto.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Ferreira<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This problem was motivated by a condominium builder who encounters a challenging problem of pricing multiple types of units in a completed building. Potential buyers are attracted to the sales office and the arrival rate is affected by the publically announced prices. The market is segmented and customers have segment-specific reservation price distributions for multiple products. The objective is to price multiple products so that the total revenue from the building should be maximized.
