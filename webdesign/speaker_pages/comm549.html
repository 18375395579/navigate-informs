Title: The Value of Centralized Product Design Under Strategic Consumer Behavior<br>Author: Robert Swinney, Associate Professor, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, robert.swinney@duke.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sang Kim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We show that decentralizing the supply chain into a design firm and a selling firm can lead to quality levels that are too low, causing more consumers to strategically delay their purchases for future discounts. Consequently, coordinating product design and operational decisions helps a supply chain mitigate strategic consumer behavior, helping explain the value of vertical integration in industries with a significant degree of strategic customer behavior, such as apparel.
