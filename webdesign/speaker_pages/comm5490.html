Title: Wholesale Price Contracts Under Demand Information Update<br>Author: Lingxiu Dong, Associate Professor, Washington University in St. Louis, Olin School of Business, Saint Louis, MO, United States of America, dong@wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Kaijie Zhu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate Pareto improvement opportunities associated with wholesale price contracts in an environment where the supplier offers two ordering opportunities to the retailer, where the second order can be placed when the retailer receives updated demand information. We show how the Pareto improvement opportunities are affected by the quality of information and the availability of the supplier's production mode.
