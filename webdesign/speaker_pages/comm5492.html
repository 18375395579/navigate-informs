Yayla-Kullu, Assistant Professor, RPI Lally School of Mgmt, 110 8th St, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, yaylah@rpi.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We discuss how and when supply chain alliances in terms of collaborative sourcing benefit partner firms. We take heterogeneity of the customer base into account. When the products of firms are differentiated, we find that joint consideration of sourcing, pricing, and demand generation objectives may result in outcomes that were not identified in previous literature.
