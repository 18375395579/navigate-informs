Title: Sparse Process Flexibility under Non-Homogenous Product Demands<br>Author: Hoda Bidkhori, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, bidkhori@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yehua Wei, David Simchi-Levi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this presentation, we study chaining and sparse process flexibilities under systems with non-homogenous plant and products. We find that for sparse flexibilities under non-homogenous system, traditional guidelines like constructing a long chain do not always work well. We provide a condition on when a collection of disjoint chains performs better than the long chain under non-homogenous system. Performance guarantees are also developed for various sparse flexibility designs.
