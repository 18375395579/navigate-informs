We find that for sparse flexibilities under non-homogenous system, traditional guidelines like constructing a long chain do not always work well. We provide a condition on when a collection of disjoint chains performs better than the long chain under non-homogenous system. Performance guarantees are also developed for various sparse flexibility designs.</br>
