Title: Component Commonality Under Product Remanufacturing<br>Author: Ravi Subramanian, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree St. NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, ravi.subramanian@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Beril Toktay, Mark Ferguson<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Using the classical approach in the market segmentation literature, we investigate incentives for component commonality when products return for remanufacture. Interestingly, there are scenarios where commonality would be preferred in the traditional forward chain but not when the forward and reverse chains are treated in conjunction, and vice-versa.
