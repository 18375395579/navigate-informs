We find that vehicle fuel economy responses follow a distinct pattern where high CAFE standards are ineffective without correspondingly high penalties for violation. Recent consumer and vehicle data suggest that vehicle decisions are more sensitive to gas prices than CAFE, and the new CAFE standards may be irrelevant if gasoline prices continue to rise.</br>
