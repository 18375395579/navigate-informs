Title: The Evolution of Competition Between Online and Offline Sellers<br>Author: Brian Ratchford, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 West Campbell Rd., SM32, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, btr051000@utdallas.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Employing survey data on consumer behavior and actual data on prices from several periods between 2000 and 2007, this paper examines the evolution of competition between different seller types in the book and CD markets. The evidence indicates that competition between online and offline sellers (the latter have tended to add online channels) is at least as intense as competition within a given format.
