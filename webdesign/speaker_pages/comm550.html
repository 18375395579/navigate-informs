Title: Unit-Contingent Electricity Swap and Asymmetric Information about Plant Outage<br>Author: Owen Wu, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, owenwu@bus.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Volodymyr Babich<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We price a unit-contingent swap contract between an electricity distributor and a power plant, where the power plant’s operational status is its private information, and characterize the Bayesian Nash equilibrium in an inspection game between them.  We show that the plant’s misrepresenting its status could benefit both the plant and the distributor because this reallocates the risk between the two parties in a way that the unit-contingent contract cannot.
