Title: Vertical Integration with Price-Setting Competitive Newsvendors<br>Author: Chongqi Wu, Assistant Professor, Alabama A&M University, PO Box 429, Normal, AL, 35762, United States, cqwu72@yahoo.com<br>Coauthor(s): Dilip Chhajed, Nicholas Petruzzi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Consider two manufacturers, each producing a substitutable product and selling it through either a decentralized or an integrated retailer, modeled as a price-setting newsvendor. A multiplicative demand function incorporating a uniform random factor is assumed. Under a uniform distribution on [0, x], the equilibrium design does not depend on x; under a uniform distribution on [1-r, 1+r], an increase in r favors the integrated structure and hurts the decentralized one.
