Title: Characterization of Adaptive Optimal Procurement Policies From the Spot Market<br>Author: Ankur Goel, University of Texas-Austin, 10926 Jollyville Road, #708, Austin, TX, United States, goel@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Genaro Gutierrez<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We characterize the optimal procurement policies in presence of commodity markets. The commodity price process is modeled as a two factor model that offers no risk-free arbitrage opportunities. We empirically compare the value of a adaptive policy, where stochastic price process parameters are updated frequently, over non-adaptive policies, where parameters of the stochastic process remain constant.
