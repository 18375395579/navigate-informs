Title: Spiteful Bidding in Sealed-Bid Auctions<br>Author: Felix Brandt, University of Munich, Oettingenstrasse 67, Munich, 80538, Germany, felix.brandt@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Yoav Shoham, Tuomas Sandholm<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We derive Bayes Nash equilibria in 1st-price and 2nd-price sealed-bid auctions for agents who maximize the weighted difference of their own profit and their competitors' profit. It turns out that revenue equivalence only holds for auctions in which all agents are either self-interested or completely malicious.
