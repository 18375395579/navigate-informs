Jim Dai, Shijie Deng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Limit order books are used to match buy and sell orders in the majority of today's financial markets. In this talk, we study the cancellations of limit orders through reconstructing the order book from order flow message data of stocks traded on NYSE Arca. We found that for both buy and sell orders, the probability distribution of price levels (relative to the same-side best quote) where cancellations occur exhibit heavy tail. We also found the life-duration of cancelled orders placed at different price levels is far from exponential. These empirical observations reflect the strategic behavior of traders. They also suggest that understanding order cancellation is important for modelling a realistic order book and designing useful trading strategies.
