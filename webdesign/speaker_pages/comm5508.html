Title: Capacity Investment and the Interplay Between Volume Flexibility and Product Flexibility<br>Author: Manu Goyal, mgoyal@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Serguei Netessine<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: It has been widely recognized that different operational flexibilities are interrelated and that exploiting the linkages between flexibility types can aid decision-making. In particular, both product flexibility and volume flexibility are tools for coping with uncertain demand. We analytically demonstrate the intertwined nature of volume flexibility and product flexibility, and show how their adoption depends on product, market and demand characteristics.
