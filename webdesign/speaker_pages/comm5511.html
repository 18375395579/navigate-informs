We study the alternatives of offering either a subscription option that limits the number of concurrent rentals in return for a flat fee per unit time or a pay-per-use option with no such restriction. In each option, customers adjust their request rate to obtain a nominal usage rate. We show that offering the  subscription option is more profitable for the firm.</br>
