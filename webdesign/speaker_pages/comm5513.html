Title: Numerical and Simulation Studies on a Supply Chain Design Problem with Supply Disruptions<br>Author: Lian Qi, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, lianqi@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zuo-Jun Max Shen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study an integrated supply chain design problem that includes one supplier, one or more retailers and customers.  Random disruptions at both the supplier and retailers are considered in our research.  We conduct extensive numerical and simulation experiments to obtain managerial insights into this supply chain design problem.
