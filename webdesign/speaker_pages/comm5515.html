Consumers value firm survival and experience a loss in utility if bankruptcy occurs. Thus, forward-looking consumers anticipate the risk of bankruptcy and may delay a purchase to see whether the firm survives. We analyze optimal capacity decisions in this setting and determine the impact of such strategic customer behavior on the firm’s profit, survival probability, and capacity level.</br>
