<br>Title: Decision Support for Reducing Consumption in Self-sustaining Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Jay Simon, Naval Postgraduate School, 699 Dyer Rd, Monterey, CA, United States of America, jrsimon@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eva Regnier</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In remote or disaster-impacted regions, resources consumed at intermediate stages of a supply chain may not be locally available, and must therefore be supplied via the chain itself.  We refer to such supply chains as self-sustaining.  Self-sustaining supply chains (SSSCs) consume significantly greater quantities of resources than  traditional supply chains.  We apply mathematical models of SSSC consumption to decision support for alternatives to reduce overall requirements and cost.</br>
