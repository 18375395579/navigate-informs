We examine channel performance and firms' profits under three arrangements: information sharing, advice provision and delegation. While standard theory predicts lack of cooperation, through laboratory experiments, we determine why and how each arrangement generates varying levels of cooperation by inducing different levels of trust and trustworthiness.</br>
