Title: Stochastic Models for Wireless Networks with Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing<br>Author: Shensheng Tang, Research Associate, ECE Dept., George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, stang1@gmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Brian L. Mark<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: An opportunistic spectrum sharing system carries two types of calls. Primary calls occupy channels irrespective of the presence of secondary calls. When a secondary call occupying a channel detects the arrival of a primary call, it moves to an idle channel or is placed in a queue where it waits for a channel to become available or until a maximum waiting time elapses. We study the performance of such a system using Markovian models and matrix-analytic methods.
