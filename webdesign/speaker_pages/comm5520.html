Title: Product and Supply Base Complexity: Implications for Cost<br>Author: Mark Jacobs, Assistant Professor, University of Dayton, 300 College Park, Dayton, OH, 45469, United States of America, majacobs@udayton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Morgan Swink<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Explicit and implicit links between product and supply chain structure are suggested in the literature, but to date remain untested empirically.  Using primary data from the automotive sector this manuscript investigates the impact of product structural complexity and supply base complexity from the perspective of Transaction Cost Economics.  Empirically revealed is the role of agency in prices paid by buyers and the cost implications of product architectural design choices.
