Interestingly, we find that if the rival's quality is neither too high nor too low, his entry can benefit the incumbent OEM. Although the rival cannibalizes some of the incumbent's demand, his entry also causes the strategic supplier to lower the wholesale price. This latter effect dominates the former when the rival's quality is not too high.</br>
