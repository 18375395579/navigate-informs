Title: Computational Analysis of Stable Coalition Structures in Sealed Bid Auctions<br>Author: Kemal Guler, Senior Scientist, Hewlett-Packard Labs, HP Labs MS1140, 1501 Page Mill, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, United States, kemal.guler@hp.com<br>Coauthor(s): Bin Zhang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study ex ante incentives to form coalitions in sealed-bid first-price and second-price auctions in private values environments. Auction subgames following a coalition formation stage involve asymmetries that necessitates a computational approach. We explore partitions of the set of bidders that are immune to deviations by individuals under exogenous sharing rules. We also explore the effects of risk aversion and dependence among bidder valuations on the stability of coalitions.
