Title: Supply Contracts in the Face of Production Disruptions<br>Author: Suleyman Demirel, Ph.D Student, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 701 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48104-1234, United States, sdemirel@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ching-hua Chen-Ritzo, Roman Kapuscinski<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Firms operating in global markets often rely on suppliers located in several locations and are vulnerable to any risks faced by their suppliers. To hedge against disruptions, firms rely on inventories or maintain multiple suppliers, often at a cost. We analyze a multi-period model where a reliable supplier and an unreliable one compete for the buyer's business. In the equilibrium, the buyer could be sole-sourcing from either of the suppliers, or keep the reliable one as a backup supplier, while carrying no inventories.
