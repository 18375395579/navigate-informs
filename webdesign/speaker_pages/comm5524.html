Using data from a manufacturer of branded apparel, we show increases in service level to be associated with statistically significant increases in retailer orders (i.e., demand, not just sales). Our study not only provides the first empirical evidence of the impact of changes in service level on demand but also illustrates a method for estimating this relationship in practice.</br>
