<br>Title: Risk-averse Optimal Stochastic Battery Storage Operation in the Presence of Price Impacts</br><br>Author: Somayeh Moazeni, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, United States of America, somayeh@Princeton.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Formulation and solution of an optimal stochastic storage operation with non-stationary stochastic electricity prices and loads, a stochastic energy source, and transaction costs of trading electricity with grid are discussed. Transaction costs explain price impacts that the storage operation creates on the electricity spot price. An optimal transmission policy for a finite planning horizon, among energy source, grid and the storage to minimize risk is developed and analyzed using ADP methods.</br>
