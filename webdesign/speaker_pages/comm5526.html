Title: RFID Adoption through Supply Chain Collaboration and Standardization<br>Author: Jun Shu, Assistant Professor, Penn State, Department of Supply Chain and Informati, 462 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, junshu@psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Terry Harrison<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a theory that predicts and guides the adoption and    standardization of RFID technology in early stage. We show that    without a strong presence of network effects for \emph{all}    firms involved---a fact in RFID adoption currently---a    universal standard will not form; however, with the sharing of    individual firms' network benefits from technology, we can    increase the sizes and reduce the number of isolated standard    coalitions, and help the technology's overall adoption.
