<br>Title: Exploring the Market of Tradable Energy Quotas for Personal Travel through Experimental Games</br><br>Author: H. M. Abdul Aziz, Ph.D. Candidate, Purdue University, 150 Arnold Dr. Apt. 15, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, haziz@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We design an experimental game to understand the market mechanism under Tradable Energy Quotas (TEQs). The TEQs system describes a market where users can buy and sell carbon credits. The unit price and availability of carbon credits in the market influence the travel choices of the users. Through the experimental game we observe the temporal dynamics of credit price and resulting evolution in the travel choices.</br>
