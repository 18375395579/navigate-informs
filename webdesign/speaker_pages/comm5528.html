These involve identifying target markets for different types of offerings and then determining customer’s willingness-to-pay through market studies. This is then used to construct a market-based price for the offering. We also describe how the on demand pricing structure can provide considerable savings to the customers on their overall IT spending through a case study employing a TCO financial estimate.</br>
