<br>Title: Optimal Dynamic Auctions for Display Advertising</br><br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, University of California-Berkeley, Department of Industrial Engineering, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, chen@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimal dynamic auction design for the display advertising industry. We characterize the precise tradeoffs between extracting the revenue from the spot markets, materializing the instantaneous benefit shared with the guaranteed advertisers, and releasing the pressure of paying the penalty eventually. We also demonstrate the inherent stochastic scheduling issue embedded in this dynamic revenue management problem.</br>
