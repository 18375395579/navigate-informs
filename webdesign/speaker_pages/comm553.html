Title: Inventory-based Dynamic Pricing with Costly Price Adjustment<br>Author: Sridhar Seshari, Professor, University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Sridhar.seshadri@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wen Chen, Qi Feng<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a long-run inventory planning problem in which the retailer can replenish inventory and change price anytime. We establish that it is optimal to change the price from low to high in each replenishment cycle, the optimal order-up-to level may decrease when the ordering cost increases, and fewer customers are served when the unit cost of procurement increases. Additionally, we provide efficient algorithms to compute the stocking and pricing policies.
