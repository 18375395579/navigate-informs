Title: Competitive Pricing and Due-Date Quotation with No Tardiness<br>Author: Ling Wang, Assistant Professor, University of Miami, liwang@exchange.sba.miami.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a competitive model in which two make-to-order firms quote non-static prices and lead-times to incoming customers. No tardiness is allowed. We identify and explain a seemingly counter-intuitive behavior - “lose-for-now?- in which the firm with smaller backlog chooses to lose the current customers to the rival.
