<br>Title: Collaboration and Joint Production in Services</br><br>Author: Uday Karmarkar, Professor, Anderson School of Management at UCLA, 110 Westwood Plaza, PO Box 951481, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1481, United States, uday.karmarkar@anderson.ucla.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Scott Carr, Guillaume Roels</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Many services involve joint  production or collaboration between the supplier and the customer, where the  customer supplies inputs or effort to varying degrees.  The management of  joint production can pose problems because the objectives of customers and  providers are quite different.  We develop a framework for modeling and analyzing markets  and contracts for joint production processes, and investigate the  relationships to the principal-agent literature.</br>
