Title: Scheduled Ordering in Decentralized Distribution Supply Chains<br>Author: Gongtao (Lucy) Chen, Cornell University, 401 Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, gc84@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinagesh Gavirneni<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We analyze two different scheduled ordering polices in a supply chain with one supplier providing a single product to multiple retailers facing identical stochastic demands. Both the cases with and without information sharing among the supply chain are considered. We develop the conditions under which those scheduled ordering policies will reduce the total supply chain cost. We also compare the performances of the two scheduled ordering polices.
