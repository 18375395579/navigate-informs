Title: Design of an Aggregated Marketplace Under Congestion Effects<br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, Assistant Professor, University of California at Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, United States, ychen0@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gustavo Vulcano, Costis Maglaras<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study an aggregated marketplace where potential buyers arrive and submit requests-for-quotes (RFQs). There are n independent suppliers modelled as M/GI/1 queues that compete for these requests. Each supplier submits a bid that comprises of a fixed price and a dynamic target leadtime, and the cheapest supplier wins the order as long as the quote meets the buyer¡¦s willingness to pay.
