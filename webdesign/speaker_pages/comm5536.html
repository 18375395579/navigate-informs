We assume the consumer's utility function depends on schedule quality and price. By analyzing the DP value function we can show that the revenue is monotonically increasing in schedule quality. This result suggests that imposing artificial restrictions on lower fare customers like 14 day advance purchase, weekend stay are actually detrimental to revenue. We explore other extensions of this model.</br>
