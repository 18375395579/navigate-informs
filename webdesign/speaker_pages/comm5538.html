Using orders, item characteristics, and POS data for 19,417 skus over 5 stores, we show that store managers systematically advance orders from peak days to preceding non-peak days, resulting in higher inventory but a more balanced handling workload. This behavior is consistent with their incentives, addresses system shortcomings, and predictably varies across items.</br>
