Title: An Analysis of Monopolistic and Competitive Collection Schemes for Recycling<br>Author: Tamer Boyaci, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, tamer.boyaci@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Fuminori Toyasaki, Vedat Verter<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We model two recyclers who set competitive treatment fees, taking into account their costs and manufacturer actions. The manufacturers compete (via prices) in the product market. Under the monopolistic scheme, the manufacturers belong to a NPO that allocates the collected EOL returns to recyclers and reflects the costs on manufacturers. Under the competitive scheme, the manufacturers directly contract with the recyclers. We identify conditions that give preference to each collection scheme.
