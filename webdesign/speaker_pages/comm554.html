<br>Title: A Differential Duopoly Game with Path Dependent Demand</br><br>Author: Leo MacDonald, Richard Ivey School of Business, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, lmacdonald@ivey.uwo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Anderson, Henning Rasmussen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a path dependent demand model of a competitive duopoly, with the problem formulated as a differential game. One area of research where path dependent demand is relevant is strategic consumer behaviour, a subject gaining prominence in the RM literature, particularly where e-commerce is a component. We set-up and discuss the solutions for the game as well as conditions for existence, and describe policy (pricing/inventory) implications and managerial insights.</br>
