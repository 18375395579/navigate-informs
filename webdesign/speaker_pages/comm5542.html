We model a firm that procures an input through a contract in advance of the selling season; and through the open market on the day in a single period so as to maximize its expected profit. We investigate the impact of yield uncertainty on the optimal contract volume and the profitability of the firm, and underline the role of yield-dependent production rate on our results.
