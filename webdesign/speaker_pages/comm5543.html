<br>Title: Optimal Assortment Under Product Returns</br><br>Author: Alex Grasas, University of Florida, Dept of Industrial &Systems Engineering, Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32608, United States, agrasas@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elif Akcali, Aydin Alptekinoglu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Motivated with the question of whether retailers should consider product returns when merchandising (as they compose their product lines), we explore the interactions between product assortment and return policy decisions of a firm under both make-to-order (MTO) and make-to-stock (MTS) environments. We show that the structure of the optimal assortment critically depends on the refund fraction and whether the products are supplied on an MTO or MTS basis.</br>
