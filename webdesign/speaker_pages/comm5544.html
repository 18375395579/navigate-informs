Title: Signaling Reciprocity in Supply Chains<br>Author: Ruth Beer, Phd Candidate, University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States of America, ruthbeer@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Leider, Hyun-Soo Ahn<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The relationship between a buyer and its suppliers is important and often goes beyond the monetary exchange resulted from transactions. We develop a theoretical model that captures acts of reciprocity and reciprocal gains. We show, theoretically and experimentally, that generous acts (e.g., a costly investment that is not required by the buyer) can serve as a signal of reciprocity to the other party and promote more collaborative relationships.
