Title: Closed-loop Supply Chain Models in Manufacturing-Remanufacturing Operations<br>Author: Tianqin Shi, University of Illnois at Urbana Champaign, 1206 S.

Using a stylized model we analyze this problem and propose incentive systems to encourage the manufacturer to design the product that can be re-manufactured.
