<br>Title: Estimating Future Impacts of Stochastic Wood Supply Risks</br><br>Author: Peter Rauch, BOKU - University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Institute of Production and Logistics, Feistmantelstrasse 4, 1180 Wien, Vienna, Austria, peter.rauch@boku.ac.at</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In Austria procurement of (combined) heating plants firing woody  biomass is threatened by recent trends like climate change, restrictions  on imports, booming wood demand in emerging nations, and rising bioenergy demand in neighboring countries. The System Dynamics model of the Austrian wood supply “RiskHo?was developed to examine the mid- and long-term impacts of supply risks on wood supply and includes key stochastic risk agents with Monte Carlo simulation.</br>
