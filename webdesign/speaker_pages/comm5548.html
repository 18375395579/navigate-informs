Title: Technology, Interoperability, and Provision of Public Safety Networks<br>Author: Hong Guo, Assistant Professor, University of Notre Dame, 356 Mendoza College of Business, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, United States of America, hguo@nd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yipeng Liu, Barrie Nault<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the key tradeoffs in provisioning public safety networks. Under decentralized provision, individual districts?technology choices jointly determine the interoperability. Under centralized provision, one uniform technology is chosen to maximize the interoperability while accommodating local needs. In contrast to common public opinions, we find that a decentralized system may provide better quality of services when technology preferences are highly diversified across districts.
