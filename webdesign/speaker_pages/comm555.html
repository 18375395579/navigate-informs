Title: Strategic Buyers and Posted Prices: An Experimental Study<br>Author: Seungbeom Kim, PhD Candidate, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business IOM Dept, Bridge Hall 401, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-0809, United States of America, seungbek@usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sriram Dasu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We conduct laboratory experiments to investigate buyers?decision processes when discounted products may be stocked out. The results yield little evidence in support of the decision processes assumed by the theoretical pricing models. Instead, buyer behavior can be better explained by the quantal response framework. Moreover, buyer decisions demonstrate several systemic biases such as anchoring and reference dependence. We discuss the implications that our findings hold for pricing strategies.
