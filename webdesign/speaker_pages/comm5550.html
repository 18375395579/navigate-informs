Title: Impact of Random Yield in Decentralized Supply Chains with Competing Suppliers<br>Author: Fei Qin, PhD Candidate, University of Cincinnati, College of Business, 312 Carl H. Lindner Hall, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, United States of America, qinfi@mail.uc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Haresh Gurnani, Uday Rao<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We investigate supply chain (SC) performance when suppliers have unreliable service rate, defined as a random proportion of the planned production quantity. We look at single sourcing as well as dual sourcing, where both suppliers compete. We check the SC agents' optimal solutions when the suppliers differ from one another in terms of their yield distributions, their procurement costs, and their risk correlation levels.
