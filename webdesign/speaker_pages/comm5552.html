Title: Capacity Planning in a Multiple Processes Supply Chain with Multiple Contract Types<br>Author: Xin Huang, M.I.T., 111 Webster Ave. Apt #2, Cambridge, MA, 02141, United States, xinhuang@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Graves<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: A key element to a company's success is its ability to match its supply to uncertain demand by utilizing different types of capacity contracts. We consider the design of a multi-product supply chain, for which each product requires multiple process capabilities. We present a multi-period model to determine the capacity investments in the presence of demand uncertainty and different contract types. We have developed efficient and practical algorithms to find the optimal capacity plan.
