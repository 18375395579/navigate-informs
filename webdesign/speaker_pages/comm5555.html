Title: Stochastic Knapsack Problem in a Competitive Environment<br>Author: Yingdong Lu, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, yingdong@us.ibm.com<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Multiple sellers competes for the same demand stream over time. Each seller makes pricing decision based on a stochastic knapsack problem incorporated with competitive information. We investigate the monotonicity behavior of each seller's revenue function, as well as its relation with the seller's market position.
