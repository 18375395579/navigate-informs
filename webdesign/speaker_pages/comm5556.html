Title: Incentive Mechanisms in Healthcare<br>Author: Mohsen Bayati, Assistant Professor, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, Stanford, United States of America, bayati@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Braverman, Ramakrishna Gummadi, Ramesh Johari<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate healthcare provider payment mechanisms with the aim of incentivizing optimal provider behavior.     We show that adding a small performance-based incentive on top of the existing mechanisms can have a dramatic effect on overall efficiency.    Our results provide theoretical support for the recent push by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to add small performance-based incentives into its reimbursement system.
