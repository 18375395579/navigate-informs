Title: Sales Format Decisions in a Supply Chain<br>Author: Chia-Wei Kuo, National Taiwan University, 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd., Taipei, Taiwan - ROC, cwkuo@ntu.edu.tw<br>Coauthor(s): Goker Aydin, Hyun-soo Ahn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain where the manufacturer has limited capacity and the retailer chooses one of two pricing regimes, posting a fixed price or negotiating, when selling to customers who are heterogeneous in their willingness-to-pay. We analyze the retailer's quantity and pricing regime decisions as well as the manufacturer's inducement of a pricing regime via the wholesale price. We show how capacity influences the manufacturer's wholesale price decision and the resultant pricing regime.
