<br>Title: Information Release under New Product Introduction</br><br>Author: Pnina Feldman, University of California-Berkeley, 545 Student Services Bldg, #1900, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, feldman@haas.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Liao, Robert Swinney</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We characterize a technology firm’s optimal information release strategy prior to introducing a new product version. Facing a tradeoff between depleting old-version inventory and inducing customers to wait for the latest version, the firm influences customers?purchasing behavior by moderating information about the new product it discloses to the customers. We investigate conditions under which it is optimal to announce information about product release timing, availability, quality, and price.</br>
