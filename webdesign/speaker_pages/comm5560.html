This argument (strategic decentralization) is usually made assuming deterministic demand. We assume stochastic demand, i.e. firms compete on price and inventory. We show that decentralization may still provide strategic benefits, but can also leave firms worse off. We also show that firms may benefit by delegating only the price decision; this provides a strategic explanation for vendor-managed-inventory.
