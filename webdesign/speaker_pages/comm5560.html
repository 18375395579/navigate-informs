<br>Title: Strategic Decentralization in Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Harish Krishnan, Assistant Professor, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, Harish.Krishnan@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sudheer Gupta</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Price competition can be mitigated if competing firms sell through independent retailers. This argument (strategic decentralization) is usually made assuming deterministic demand. We assume stochastic demand, i.e. firms compete on price and inventory. We show that decentralization may still provide strategic benefits, but can also leave firms worse off. We also show that firms may benefit by delegating only the price decision; this provides a strategic explanation for vendor-managed-inventory.</br>
