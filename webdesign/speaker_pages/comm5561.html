Often, competing firms outsource this service process to one or more common service suppliers.  When they outsource to a common provider, this gives rise to a service supply chain. We develop analytical models to characterize the benefits and disadvantages of outsourcing in industries in which the retailers compete in terms of prices and waiting time.</br>
