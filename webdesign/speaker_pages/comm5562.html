Title: Sponsored Search Marketing: Dynamic Pricing and Advertising for an Online Retailer<br>Author: Shengqi Ye, Doctoral Student, Indiana University at Bloomington, 1309 E. 10th Street, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, shye@indiana.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Goker Aydin, Shanshan Hu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many online retailers rely on search engine marketing, i.e., paying a search engine to promote the retailer’s website. We consider an online retailer that dynamically updates its price as well as its ad spending. We show that the retailer’s ability to update its ad spending may have surprising effects on the retailer’s optimal pricing. For example, larger inventory levels might lead to higher prices, if such inventory levels also encourage aggressive ad spending.
