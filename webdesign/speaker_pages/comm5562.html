We consider an online retailer that dynamically updates its price as well as its ad spending. We show that the retailer’s ability to update its ad spending may have surprising effects on the retailer’s optimal pricing. For example, larger inventory levels might lead to higher prices, if such inventory levels also encourage aggressive ad spending.</br>
