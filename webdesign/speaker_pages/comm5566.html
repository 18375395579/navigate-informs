Title: Service Differentiation in Large-Scale Systems<br>Author: John Yao, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, jyao14@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Costis Maglaras, Assaf Zeevi<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of a monopolistic service provider who offers a menu of services to a market of heterogeneous price- and delay-sensitive customers.  We highlight how a simple deterministic problem reveals the heavy-traffic operating regime induced by the revenue maximizing or social welfare maximizing optimal policy.  Moreover, we show that the optimal service offering may be well-approximated by one with many fewer service classes.
