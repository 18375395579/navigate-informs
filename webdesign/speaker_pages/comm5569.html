We use a panel dataset consisting of applications?sales, prices, and characteristics from two leading app stores ?Apple App Store and Google Android Market. Results show that demand increases with the filesize of apps, the age of apps, and the length of description. Counterfactual experiments show price discount strategies result in a greater increase of app demand in Apple App Store compared to Google Android Market.</br>
