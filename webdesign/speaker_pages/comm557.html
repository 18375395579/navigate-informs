Title: A Model for Category Management with Vendor-Specific Product Portfolios<br>Author: Matt Drake, Assistant Professor, Duquesne University, A.J. Palumbo School of Business, Donahue Graduate School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15282, United States, matt.drake@comcast.net<br>Coauthor(s): Julie Swann<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Some retail firms are allowing suppliers to choose the assortment of products to stock in their stores in addition to the stocking levels. This practice can have significant implications when there is limited shelf space and vendor competition. We present such a model in which vendors producing multiple substitutable products stock their own allocated space. We develop mechanisms to align the economic incentives in this environment and consider the implications of this strategy for consumers.
