We show that with the possibility of repeated trade, decentralization can be beneficial in improving supply chain performance. With decentralized decision making, it is easier to incentivize players to coordinate on efficient actions. It is manifested both in higher supply chain profits and more flexibility in contracting terms that are acceptable to all players.
