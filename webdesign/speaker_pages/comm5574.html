A distributor serves only a subset of retailers for whom she/he is the sole supplier. The unsatisfied demands at all the installations are backordered. Assuming the base-stock policy, the objective is to determine the best installation inventory order policy parameters such as the base-stock levels and inventory rationing quantities, with the objective of minimizing the total supply chain cost (TSCC) consisting of holding costs and shortage costs at all installations in the supply chain over a finite planning horizon. An integer programming model to determine the optimal inventory control-policy parameters is proposed in this work. Computational complexity limits the applicability of the exact solution method to large problem sizes. Therefore, in the current study we also propose a hybrid heuristic technique based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine the best base-stock levels. A heuristic rationing rule determines the shipment (rationing) quantity in the case of shortage at a higher installation, while meeting the customer demands. The performance of the hybrid heuristic against the stand-alone GA and PSO is ascertained by testing the algorithms under various supply chain settings.</br>
