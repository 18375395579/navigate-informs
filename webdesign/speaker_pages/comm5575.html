Hall</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consider a multiple product supply chain where a manufacturer allocates capacity to distributors in response to their orders. The distributors may share their allocated capacity, using a cooperative game, and resubmit orders. We estimate the benefit of considering scheduling costs in capacity allocation decisions, the value of capacity sharing by the distributors, and the value of coordination between the manufacturer and the distributors. We provide exact estimates of the value of coordination.</br>
