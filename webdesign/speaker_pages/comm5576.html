Title: Auction Design for Local Reserve Energy Markets<br>Author: Reinhard Madlener, Professor of Energy Economics and Management, RWTH Aachen University, Mathieustrasse, Aachen, 52074, Germany, RMadlener@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de<br>Coauthor(s): Christiane Rosen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We develop an auction mechanism that is designed for a local energy market. It is aimed at enabling regional trading of ancillary services, but can also be used for administering negotiation processes in virtual power plants or microgrids. In order to test the performance of the proposed auction mechanism, a simple multiagent-based simulation program has been devised. We find that the theoretical predictions hold in fact and competition quickly leads to price convergence.
