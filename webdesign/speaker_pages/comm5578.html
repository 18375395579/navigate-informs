Both brands use a critical component that is sourced from two different suppliers,  which are prone to disruption.  As a consequence of this supply uncertainty, the manufacturer may not be able to offer product variants of a brand in the marketplace.  We examine how this uncertainty in supply affect her pricing, product variety and inventory decisions.
