<br>Title: Optimal Pricing for Multiple Products and Customers with Different Risk Tolerence</br><br>Author: Max Shen, Associate Professor, University of California, Department of IEOR, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1777, United States of America, shen@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tingting Cui</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a Stackleberg game between a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer, as the leader, decides the wholesale prices for a set of products it offers in order to maximize total profits. The retailer decides order quantities with respect to the wholesale prices and random demands. Based on different properties of the utility function, we develop various techniques to compute the equilibrium solution.</br>
