We find that even in the absence of the well-known transactional and informational advantages of mediation, intermediaries improve supply chain performance. In particular, intermediaries facilitate responsive adaptation of the buyers?supplier base to their changing needs while simultaneously ensuring that suppliers behave as if they had long- term sourcing commitments from buying firms.</br>
