Title: Optimal Market-Making with Risk Aversion<br>Author: Miao Song, MIT, 77 Mass.

One approach to reduce the risk brought by price uncertainty is to adjust the inventory at the price of losing potential spread gain. Using stochastic dynamic programming, we show that a threshold inventory control policy is optimal with respect to an exponential utility criterion.
