Title: A Dynamic Network Game for the Adoption of Technologies of Uncertain Value<br>Author: Matt V.

Jackson, Ramesh Johari<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a class of dynamic network games to study the adoption of technologies of uncertain value. This value can be learned by experimenting or by free-riding on others?experimentation. For an important set of technologies, the often-used policy offering a price discount to early adopters is least efficient. We demonstrate that a referral incentive policy may cause both low and high-degree agents to experiment whereas middle-degree agents free-ride on the information they generate.
