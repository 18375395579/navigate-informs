We consider a firm that has access to a responsive but expensive source (Mexico) and a cheap but remote source (China). The firm determines an inventory sourcing policy to satisfy random demand. We analyze a base-surge policy, which is simple, used in practice, and captures the classic tradeoff between cost versus responsiveness.</br>
