Title: Global Dual Sourcing: Tailored Base & Surge Allocation to Mexico and China<br>Author: Gad Allon, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, g-allon@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jan Van Mieghem<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: When designing a global dual sourcing strategy, a firm must determine the average order rates placed to each source since it affects supplier management and cost. We consider a firm that has access to a responsive but expensive source (Mexico) and a cheap but remote source (China). The firm determines an inventory sourcing policy to satisfy random demand. We analyze a base-surge policy, which is simple, used in practice, and captures the classic tradeoff between cost versus responsiveness.
