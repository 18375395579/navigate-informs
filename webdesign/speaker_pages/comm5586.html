Title: Price and Reorder Flexibility for Differentiated Short Lifecycle Products under Competition<br>Author: Philipp Afeche, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St.George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S3E6, Canada, Philipp.Afeche@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca<br>Coauthor(s): Ming Hu, Yang Li<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study competing providers of differentiated short lifecycle products with uncertain demand. They place initial orders before, and choose prices and reorder quantities after observing demand. We (1) show that the expected profit functions may be bimodal and characterize the equilibrium order/reorder and pricing strategies; (2) quantify under what conditions reorder flexibility increases or hurts profitability; (3) discuss how the mode of competition affects the value of volume flexibility.
