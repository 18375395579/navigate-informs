Box 248294, Coral Gables, FL, 33124, United States of America, merkoc@miami.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Wu, Haresh Gurnani</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this study we consider a make-to-order (MTO) firm where marketing and manufacturing divisions simultaneously make due-date and capacity investment decisions, respectively. We study the impact of how two divisions share the costs associated with tardy deliveries, and derive the equilibrium policies. We investigate the value of capacity flexibility.</br>
