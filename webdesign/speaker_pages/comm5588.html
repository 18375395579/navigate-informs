Title: A Comparison of Optimal Pricing Strategies under Various Risk Considerations<br>Author: Chase Murray, PhD Candidate, University at Buffalo, 308A Bell Hall, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Buffalo, NY, 14260-1900, United States of America, cmurray3@eng.buffalo.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Mark Karwan, Abhijit Gosavi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider the single-product, single-period pricing problem with stochastic demand.  Our work focuses on the comparison of the optimal pricing strategy across several ways of quantifying risk (e.g., the probability that expected revenues fall below a target level,  variance, or variance below a target revenue).  Efficient solution techniques for problems where no closed-form solution exists are presented.  Extensions to the multi-product, multi-period problem will also be discussed.
