<br>Title: Information Quality and Competition in the Supply Chain Network</br><br>Author: Deanna Kennedy, Assistant Professor, University of Washington Bothell, 18115 Campus Way NE, Bothell, WA, 98028, United States of America, dkennedy@uwb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Qiang Qiang, Zugang Liu, Trisha Anderson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper focuses on competition and the quality of information shared among supply chain players. We investigate the dynamics between the firms in a general supply chain network. We model the network to capture interactions among various information quality dimensions including information sharing, information distortion, and accuracy. We derive the equilibrium conditions and use numerical examples to provide managerial implications.</br>
