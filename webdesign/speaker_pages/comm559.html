The CV holds inventory at a vendor managed hub and charges a fixed unit price under a quantity commitment contract. Inventory procured from the SM with volatile prices is held at an advance purchase hub.  The overall problem deals with when and how much to order from each source and how to allocate demand to the alternative hubs.</br>
