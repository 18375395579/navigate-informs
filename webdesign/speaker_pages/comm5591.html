Title: Willingness to Pay for Modular Products<br>Author: Glen Schmidt, Professor, University of Utah, David Eccles School of Business, Salt Lake City, UT, 84103, United States, glen.schmidt@business.utah.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sezer Ulku<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: The market offers relatively few high-tech products that are modular-in-use, whereby the customer can upgrade individual components of the product as technology improves.  We explore as a possible contributing factor the notion of hyperbolic discounting ?customers may prefer the instant gratification offered by a lower-cost integral product, rather than pay a “rational?premium for a modular-in-use design.
