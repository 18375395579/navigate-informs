Title: A Model of Multi-Period Forward and Reverse Auctions<br>Author: Kendra Taylor, Senior Consultant, Booz Allen Hamilton, Suite 2100, 230 Peachtree Street NW, Atlanta, GA, 30303, United States, taylor_kendra@bah.com<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We compare the expected value to suppliers and buyers when each participates in a sequential auction as bidder, auction-initiator, or alternates between both roles in a new auction design simulating seasonal markets. We find the alternating design is a viable compromise in disagreements on holding a forward or reverse auction.
