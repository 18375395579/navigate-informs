<br>Title: To Preempt or Not to Preempt? A Timing Decision Model for Software Functionality Additions</br><br>Author: Amy Ping Wu, Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Information and Decision Sciences, 321 Nineteenth Avenue South, Suite 3-365, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, pwu1@csom.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Kauffman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a game-theoretic model to study the optimal timing for vendors to add new software functionality to their technology products.  An example of such functionality additions is the expansion of portals' capabilities to provide digital photo storage. We find that when vendors face heterogeneous launching costs and different time lags in capturing profits (i.e., value latency), a vendor should compare its own launch cost and value latency with those of its rivals to decide its launch time.</br>
