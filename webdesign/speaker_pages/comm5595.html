This talk will explore a relation between prophet inequalities and the analysis of optimal online pricing mechanisms for digital goods.  We will present some new (and nearly optimal) multi-choice prophet inequalities, and we will apply them to understand the effect of different temporal incentive constraints on the expected revenue of the optimal dominant-strategy incentive-compatible online mechanism.</br>
