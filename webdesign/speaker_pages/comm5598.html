For a manufacturer with multiple plants, we analyze K-chain flexibility designs in which each plant is capable of producing exactly K products. We find that 3-chain is significantly more robust than 2-chain when there is demand uncertainty. In an assembly system, we find that investment in process flexibility changes the optimal inventory placements.</br>
