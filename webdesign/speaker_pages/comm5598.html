Title: Increasing Supply Chain Robustness through Process Flexibility and Strategic Inventory<br>Author: He Wang, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, wanghe@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi, Yehua Wei<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: This presentation discusses the combination of process flexibility and strategic inventory as an effective disruption mitigation strategy. For a manufacturer with multiple plants, we analyze K-chain flexibility designs in which each plant is capable of producing exactly K products. We find that 3-chain is significantly more robust than 2-chain when there is demand uncertainty. In an assembly system, we find that investment in process flexibility changes the optimal inventory placements.
