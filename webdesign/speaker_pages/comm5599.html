Title: A Multi-Retailer Decentralized Distribution System with Updated Demand Information<br>Author: Ulas Ozen, PhD candidate, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Department of Technology Management, Eindhoven, MB, Netherlands, u.ozen@tm.tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Greys Sosic<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a distribution system that consists of a manufacturer, a warehouse, and n retailers who face stochastic demand. The retailers can update their demand forecasts while their orders are shipped to the warehouse. We analyze three cases (non-cooperating retailers, cooperating retailers, and manufacturer's resale of returned items), and we investigate the impact that each of these models has on the retailers and the manufacturer. Afterwards, we focus on coordination of the supply chain.
