Title: Infinite-Horizon Models for Inventory Control Under Yield Uncertainty and Disruptions<br>Author: Amanda Schmitt, PhD Student, Lehigh University, 1859 Mansfield Street, Hellertown, PA, 18055, United States, amanda@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Snyder<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We analyze the costs and optimal policies for an inventory system with an unreliable supplier that is subject to regular variance in supply as well as complete disruptions. We also consider a second, reliable (but more expensive) supplier. We compare the optimal policies to those us found using two common approximations: horizon trucation and variance bundling. We show that these approximations distort the order quantities, under-utilize the reliable supplier, and increase costs.
