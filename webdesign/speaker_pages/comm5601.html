<br>Title: Cost-per-Impression Pricing for Display Advertising</br><br>Author: Sami Najafi-Asadolahi, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, sami.najafi@rotman.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kristin Fridgeirsdottir</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We determine the optimal cost-per-impression (CPM) prices of display ads for a web publisher facing uncertain demand from advertisers requesting space on its website and uncertain supply of impressions from viewers. We formulate the problem as a novel queueing system, where the advertising slots correspond to service channels providing synchronized services. We discuss the model and show that, e.g., the optimal CPM price may increase in the number of ads rotating among slots.</br>
