<br>Title: Capacity Investment, Production Scheduling and Financing Choice</br><br>Author: Derek Wang, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, wangdd@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Owen Wu, Hyun-Soo Ahn</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Mining/energy projects usually require huge initial investment beyond the firm's working capital. We study the capacity investment and production decisions of a capital-constrained firm that can finance through either debt or joint venture in a multi-period model. We show how financing schemes influence the operational policies and describe the conditions under which the firm chooses debt financing over joint venture.</br>
