Suppliers in their turn provide manufacturers with several prototypes of the component. We model the sequential prototyping problem as a dynamic non-cooperative game. We examine and compare three schemes of collaboration between manufacturers and suppliers which provide different level of flexibility for manufacturers. We show that under some conditions additional flexibility can be harmful for manufacturers.</br>
