Title: Benefits and Shortcomings of Flexibility in Collaborative Prototyping<br>Author: Timofey Shalpegin, HEC Paris, 1 rue de la Liberation, Jouy en Josas, 78350, France, timofey.shalpegin@hec.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Svenja Sommers, Zhixi Wan<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Manufacturers often involve suppliers to develop innovative components. Suppliers in their turn provide manufacturers with several prototypes of the component. We model the sequential prototyping problem as a dynamic non-cooperative game. We examine and compare three schemes of collaboration between manufacturers and suppliers which provide different level of flexibility for manufacturers. We show that under some conditions additional flexibility can be harmful for manufacturers.
