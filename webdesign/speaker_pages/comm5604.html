Title: Price Volatility in Electricity Auctions: A Strategic Analysis<br>Author: Shanshan Hu, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan Ross School of Business, 2007 Huron Parkway, Apt. 9, Ann Arbor, MI, 48104, United States, husz@bus.umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): William Lovejoy, Roman Kapuscinski<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: The wholesale electricity markets have exhibited great price volatility and are of regulatory and practical interests. We directly model the electricity auction and show that price stochasticity results jointly from demand uncertainty and bidders' strategic randomization. Based on numerical studies, we establish the profiles of demand variability, capacity utilizations and price volatility.
