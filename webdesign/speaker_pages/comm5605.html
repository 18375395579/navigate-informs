Title: Store Brand Positioning in the Presence of Retail Competition<br>Author: Bo Liao, PhD Candidate, Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, bo_liao@haas.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Candace Yano<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We characterize a retailer’s equilibrium store-brand quality level when competing with another retailer also offering a store brand; both retailers carry the same national brand.  All parties choose their respective prices.  We find the retailer’s key tradeoff is between product differentiation and bargaining power vis-?vis the national brand manufacturer.
