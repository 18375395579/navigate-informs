Title: Pricing Services with Strategic Customers<br>Author: Pengfei Guo, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, lgtpguo@polyu.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Yulan Wang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: The paper studies a two-period pricing game in a single-server service  system. We  assume two types of servers: one is to maximize its revenue and the other is to maximize the social welfare. Then we consider both  myopic and strategic  customers and  derive the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) prices.  We  evaluate the impact on the system's performance measures of  misunderstanding strategic customers to be myopic and myopic customers to be strategic by decision makers.
