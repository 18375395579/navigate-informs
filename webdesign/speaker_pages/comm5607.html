<br>Title: Multi-channel Competition with Opaque Products</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Assistant Professor, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kinshuk Jerath, Serguei Netessine</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Priceline, Hotwire and several other companies popularized selling of opaque travel products whose exact specification is masked from the consumer until the sale is complete. We show that opaque products are effective in dealing with strategic consumers who face a trade-off of buying a transparent product at a higher price now with the chance of getting opaque product at a lower price later.</br>
