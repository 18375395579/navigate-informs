<br>Title: Quality Score that Makes You Invest</br><br>Author: Yi Zhu, University of Southern California, 3660 Trousdale Parkway, ACC306E, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, zhuy@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zsolt Katona</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many search engines and other ad auctions use a quality score to favor certain advertisers in the auction. The results suggest that often a type of quality score that considers both advertisers?qualities and CTR than one that only CTR is optimal. Such a quality score increases both advertisers?qualities and the auctioneer's revenue. These results are stronger when there are (i) more advertising slots, (ii) when these slots are similar, and (iii) when quality investments are expensive.</br>
