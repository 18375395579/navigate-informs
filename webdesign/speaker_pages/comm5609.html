Cooper, Diwakar Gupta</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study air-cargo capacity contracts between a carrier and a freight forwarder in settings where the forwarder possesses some private information. Working in the principal-agent paradigm, we propose contract schemes that overcome inefficiencies associated with the asymmetric information.</br>
