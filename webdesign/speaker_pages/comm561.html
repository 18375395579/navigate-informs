<br>Title: Competing with Free: Impact of Movie Broadcasts on DVD Sales and Internet Piracy</br><br>Author: Michael Smith, Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 4800 Forbes Avenue, HBH 2105D, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, mds@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rahul Telang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Movie studios have long argued that TV broadcasts serve as a substitute to media purchases, and a complement to Internet piracy. We empirically analyze these concerns and find exactly the opposite effect. DVD sales increase by an average of 360-410% immediately after a movie is shown on broadcast TV. Furthermore, TV broadcasts are not associated with a statistically significant increase in either the supply of or demand for pirated movies on popular Internet file-sharing networks.</br>
