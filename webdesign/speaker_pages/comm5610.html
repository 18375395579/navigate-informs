Title: A Supply Chain Optimization Model for Perishable Goods with Quality Dependent Value<br>Author: Nicholas Mason, Student, Arizona State University, University Drive and Mill Avenue, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, anmason@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Omar Ahumada, Rene Villalobos<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Perishability, seasonality and non-uniform product quality make the sourcing and distribution of fresh agricultural products a challenging task. We therefore propose a mixed integer programming model that captures product perishability using discrete quality states, with a value function that is not strictly decreasing. We model product degradation during storage and transportation as well as quality distribution of products at purchase in a three tier food supply chain.
