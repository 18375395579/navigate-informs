Title: An Integrated Approach to Commodity Risk Management<br>Author: Fehmi Tanrisever, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, 5612, Netherlands, f.tanrisever@tue.nl<br>Coauthor(s): Genaro Gutierrez<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: In this paper, we examine the integrated operating and financial hedging decisions of a value maximizing firm, under the presence of capital market imperfections. Motivated by the flour milling industry, we consider a commodity processor who buys a certain commodity, converts it into a final product and sells it to the end customers. In presence of costly external funds, we derive the optimal value-maximizing policy and compare it with a simple short-hedge.
