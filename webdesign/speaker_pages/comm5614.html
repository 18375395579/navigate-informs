Title: Revenue Management with Upgrading and Opportunistic Behavior<br>Author: Fuqiang Zhang, Associate Professor, Washington University, Simon Hall 236, St. Louis, United States of America, FZhang22@WUSTL.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Yueshan Yu, Guang Xiao<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper we study the impact of opportunistic behavior on a firm's selling strategy. The firm sells two products and uses the high-quality product to upgrade the demand for low-quality product if needed. Customers can be opportunistic in the sense that they purposely choose to buy the low-quality product in anticipation of upgrading. We find that such opportunistic behavior may either hurt or benefit the firm depending on different conditions.
