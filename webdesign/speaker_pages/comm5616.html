Title: Optimal Policies for an Unreliable Serial System with Dual External Sourcing<br>Author: Amar Sapra, University of Florida, Industrial and System Eng. Department, Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, sapra@ise.ufl.edu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a two-stage serial system in which the supply to the the upstream stage from the external supplier is prone to disruptions.  As a result, the upstream stage is unable to ship to the downstream stage.  The downstream stage continues functioning by ordering directly from an emergency supplier.  We show that the optimal policy takes a simple form only when all the lead-times are equal.
