Title: Impact of Process and Pricing Decisions on Successive Generations of New Products<br>Author: Janice Carrillo, Associate Professor, Warrington College of Business, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, janice.carrillo@cba.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Michelle MH Seref<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop an analytical model of coordinated product and process development when there are multiple generations of a product.  Critical strategic decisions include not only the timing of successive product generations, but also introduction of advances in production technology.  Trade-offs considered in the coordinated decision include demand and pricing implications for the next generation product.
