Title: Public Forecast Information Sharing in a Market with Competing Supply Chains<br>Author: Hyo duk Shin, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, hyoduk-shin@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Noam Shamir<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: This paper studies the operational motivation of a retailer to publicly announce its forecast information. We show that by making forecast information publicly available to both his upstream manufacturer and competitor, a retailer is able to credibly share his forecast information - an outcome that cannot be achieved by merely exchanging information within the supply chain.
