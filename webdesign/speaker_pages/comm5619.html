Title: Selecting Distribution Channel Strategies for Non-profit Organizations<br>Author: Annie Niu, University of Alberta, PhD Program, School of Business, Edmonton, AB, T6H 4M5, Canada, rniu@ualberta.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Ignacio Castillo, Xuan Zhao<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Many non-profit organizations have been turning to commercial activities to increase revenues due to declining government/donor support. By selling products or services related to its institutional mission using a particular distribution channel strategy, a non-profit organization might reach more people. We analyze how a non-profit organization should select its distribution channel strategy under certain market conditions and consider a non-profit organization's channel strategy when competing with a fully integrated or decentralized for-profit channel.
