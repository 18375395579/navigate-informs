<br>Title: Allocative Efficiency in an Oligopolistic Market: An Example of Rational Inefficiency</br><br>Author: Andrew Johnson, Texas A & M University, 4033 ETB, College Station, TX, United States of America, ajohnson@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chia-Yen Lee</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper models the production possibility set and the inverse demand function to identify a Nash equilibrium and improvement targets which may not be on the production frontier. This behavior is referred to as rational inefficiency because the firm reduces its productivity levels in order to increase profits. For a general multiple input/output production process which allows a firm to adjust variable input and output levels, the existence and the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium is proven.</br>
