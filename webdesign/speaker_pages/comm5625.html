Title: Dynamic Risk Management of Electricity Contracts with Contingent Portfolio Programming<br>Author: Janne Kettunen, Researcher, Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory, P.O. Box 1100, Espoo, 02150, Finland, jkettunen@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Derek Bunn, Ahti Salo<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We develop a contingent optimization approach for the management of the electricity contract portfolio that accounts for the uncertain electricity prices and loads, and which permits the specification of Conditional Value-at-Risk requirements. We show that the modelling of price and load correlations is important and that our model yields higher expected return at a lower risk level than conventional approaches. We also derive insights from the perspective of competitive and risk averse players.
