These can result in both short-term loss of revenue and long-term shifts in market share. We present a model that captures both tactical and strategic consequences of business continuity disruptions of supply chains in competitive environments. We use our analytic and numerical results to highlight the conditions that magnify the consequences of supply chain disruptions and to identify policies for minimizing resulting risks.</br>
