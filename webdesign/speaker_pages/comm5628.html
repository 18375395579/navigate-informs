Title: Price Volatility in Airline Markets<br>Author: Benny Mantin, Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, bmantin@uwaterloo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): David Gillen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Revenue management is used by all airlines as well as in car rentals, theatres and hotels. The systems update prices as time progresses to match realized demand to expected demand, termed the booking curve. Purchase behaviour may differ based on how stable and predictable prices are. Airlines may have the incentive to introduce price volatility as a means to affect demand. We examine two volatility measures, and investigate what factors explain more or less volatility.
