Title: Fair and Efficient Implementation of Collective Extended Producer Responsibility Legislation<br>Author: Luyi Gui, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, luyi.gui@gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Atalay Atasu, Beril Toktay, Ozlem Ergun<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Extended Producer Responsibility is a policy tool that holds producers financially responsible for the post-use handling of their products. EPR implementations are typically collective - a large collection and recycling network  handles multiple producers' products; Total cost is then allocated to producers proportionally such as by return share. In this paper, we study the design of fair cost allocation mechanisms for collective EPR by adjusting the widely used return share allocation.
