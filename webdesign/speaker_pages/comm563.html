We analyze the `Decentralization Cost', the ratio between the Nash equilibrium cost and the cost attained at the centralized optimum. Solution properties and bounds on the decentralization cost are derived for a dispatching-sequencing model. A scheduling-based coordinating mechanism is then provided, ensuring that the centralized solution is obtained at equilibrium.</br>
