<br>Title: Multi-period Procurement Strategies in the Presence of Unreliable Suppliers</br><br>Author: Awi Federgruen, Professor, Columbia University, 419 Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, af7@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nan Yang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze multi-period planning models for a firm which needs to cover uncertain demands by procuring supplies from multiple sources with random yields. The suppliers differ in terms of their yield distributions, prices and capacities. A procurement strategy determines, in each period, how much to order and from whom, as a function of the prevailing inventory. We characterize the structure of an optimal procurement strategy and develop efficient algorithms to compute the strategy.</br>
