When a firm offers a single lead time and price, it is called uniform quotation mode. The differentiated quotation mode is when a firm offers a menu of lead times and prices for customers to choose from. By modeling, analyzing, and comparing these two quotation modes, we provide guidelines for a manager to choose a suitable mode for his/her firm.</br>
