Title: A Stochastic Optimization Method for Supply Chain Inventory Coordination under Private Information<br>Author: Eric Beier, Ph.D. Student, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, ebeier@tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Lewis Ntaimo<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a method for supply chain inventory control designed to facilitate global coordination under private information restrictions and stochastic demand. In such a system, competition, confidentiality, etc, prevent a global view of the system. We decompose the system into private nodal MIP and stochastic MIP subproblems. Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient optimization facilitate negotiation between the nodal decisions without any entity gaining access to the private information.
