In this work, we extend their result to bidders with submodular valuations.  We first define an abstract framework in which we generalize some bounds on the revenue of PAUSE. As a concrete instance of this abstraction, we define subPAUSE for submodular bidders. We demonstrate desirable properties of subPAUSE as compared with popular auctions in theory and practice.</br>
