Title: Vendor Selection Problem with Inventory Decisions Under Disruptions<br>Author: Sharif Melouk, Assistant Professor, University of Alabama, Operations Management, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487-0226, United States of America, smelouk@cba.ua.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Burcu Keskin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Evaluation and selection of vendors to lower costs has become a key element in supply chain management due to increasingly competitive global markets. Furthermore, companies strive for resiliency so as to minimize the effect when supply chain disruptions occur. In this research, we develop a simulation-optimization approach to identify the set of vendors that minimizes the total costs and achieves desired service and reliability levels. Numerical tests provide managerial insights.
