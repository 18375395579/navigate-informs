<br>Title: Capacity Investment and Pricing Strategy Under Technology Evolution</br><br>Author: Xiao Huang, PhD Candidate, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, Xiao.Huang.2009@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Greys Sosic</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consider a market with two products, in which the new technology is on some attributes inferior to the old one. Our model consists of an entrant who can use only the new technology, and an incumbent who can use both. A segment of the customers is loyal to the new technology, while the rest can purchase either product. We study how the firms strategically determine their capacities and prices under technology evolution, and determine equilibria under different assumptions about the capacity cost.</br>
