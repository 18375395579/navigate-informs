We hypothesize that these search tools result in demand shifts around advance purchase deadlines. In this study, we use search and purchase data from a single OTA to quantify the level of consumer surplus generated by these website search tools.  Results show that there is a significant shift in demand due to the presence of advance purchase deadline.  We measure consumer surplus using instrumented variable regressions, which control for endogeneity between supply and demand.</br>
