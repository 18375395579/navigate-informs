<br>Title: Making Quality Decisions in Tough Economic Times</br><br>Author: Leon Chu, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, leonyzhu@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lian Qi, Rachel Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper analyzes a two-dimensional model for firm's optimal quality decisions where consumers vary both in their reserve utility for the product and in their sensitivity towards the quality. While the firm may want to offer lower quality products when the consumers?quality sensitivities deteriorate, the optimal response towards changes in the reserve utility depends on the target consumer groups. Our study highlights the importance of separating reserve utility from the quality sensitivity.</br>
