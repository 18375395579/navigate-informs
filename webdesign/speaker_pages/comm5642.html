<br>Title: Capital Structure, Inventory Management, and Coordination</br><br>Author: Matthew Sobel, Professor, Weatherhead School, Department of Operations Management, Case Western Reserve, Cleveland, OH, 44106-7235, United States of America, Matthew.Sobel@Case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Qaiohai (Joice) Hu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We optimize the expected present value of dividends in a dynamic model of a firm with long-term debt and stochastic product market demand. The results depend on whether short-run operating and financial decisions are coordinated or decentralized.  Coordinated decisions yield higher expected dividends net of capital subscriptions with smaller inventories, retained earnings, and default risk.  A firm that coordinates short-term decisions needs less long-term debt than if it decentralizes them.</br>
