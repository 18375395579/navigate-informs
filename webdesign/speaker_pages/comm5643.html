Title: Auction Pricing of Network Access for North American Railways<br>Author: Steven Harrod, Assistant Professor, University of Dayton, 300 College Park, Dayton, OH, 45469, United States of America, steven.harrod@udayton.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: An auction process is suggested as necessary to maintain transparency in the pricing of rail network open access. Multiple random samples of auction pricing for a single track railway line demonstrate that the infrastructure entity will receive approximately 15.6% less than the true value of the contracted train paths. This loss of revenue threatens the objective of reducing government subsidy for the railway network.
