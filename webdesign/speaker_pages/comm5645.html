We show that the manufacturing financing contract complements the existing contract forms in supply chain coordination and in profit allocation.  Our study indicates that the financial status of the retailer, the gross margin of the product, and the power structure of a supply chain are important factors that influence the selection of coordinating contracts.</br>
