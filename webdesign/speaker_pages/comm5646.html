Each firm, offering all or some portion of the product, adopts a price function proportional to its costs by deciding on the size of a markup. Customers then choose a set of providers that offers the lowest total cost. We characterize equilibria of the two-stage game and study the efficiency resulting from the competitive structure of the market.</br>
