<br>Title: On the Perception of Supply Contract</br><br>Author: Mirko Kremer, University of Mannheim, Schloss, S 231, Mannheim, BW, Germany, Mirko.Kremer@bwl.uni-mannheim.de</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Contradicting the normative benchmark, recent experimental research indicates that actual order behavior is differs under a revenue sharing and a buy back contract which are deemed to be technically equivalent in a simple supply chain setting with a supplier selling to a newsvendor. We extend on this matter by considering choice between contracts rather than the behavior under them. Our results are largely an issue of decision framing but can be neatly tied to established behavioral theory.</br>
