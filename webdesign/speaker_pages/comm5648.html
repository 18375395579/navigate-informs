Title: Contract Special Reference Points in Supply Contracts<br>Author: Michael Becker-Peth, University of Cologne, Albertus-Magnus-Platz, Cologne, 50923, Germany, michael.becker-peth@uni-koeln.de<br>Coauthor(s): Ulrich Thonemann<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Recently many experimental studies have shown that behavioral aspects have to be taken into account when choosing the type of contract and specifying the contract parameters. Building on reference dependent valuation with reference values on contract parameters we can explain different order decisions for contracts which are identical in final outcomes for given order quantities and demand realizations. We show how contract designers can use these insides to design better contracts.
