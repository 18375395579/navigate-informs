Title: Iterative Auctions for General Graphical Valuations<br>Author: Ozan Candogan, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, Durham, NC, United States of America, candogan@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Asuman Ozdaglar, Pablo Parrilo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Multi-item iterative auctions are commonly employed in practice, for instance, in the context of spectrum and procurement auctions. However, existing efficient iterative auction formats either do not allow for value complementarity between different items, or they require complex pricing structures. In this work, we focus on graphical valuations and develop new practical and efficient iterative auctions for multi-item settings that exhibit both value complementarity and substitutability.
