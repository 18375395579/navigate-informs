<br>Title: Buyer-Supplier Relationships in Global Sourcing Networks</br><br>Author: Elena Belavina, Assistant Professor, University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60611, United States of America, Elena.Belavina@chicagobooth.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karan Girotra</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study general bipartite buyer-supplier networks, where buyer demand and supplier supply are uncertain. We identify network structures that are most amenable to establish relational equilibria in sourcing transactions. Our results illustrate challenge a number of widely held beliefs on supplier management strategies, for instance considering the  network structure shows that  wider supplier bases may be inimical to  buyers.</br>
