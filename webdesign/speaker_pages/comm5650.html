Alex Yang, Rodney Parker, John Birge<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a financially distressed retailer's inventory and pricing decisions in the presence of strategic consumers. The retailer has to make three decisions: initial price, initial stocking quantity, and liquidation price. Our results show that understanding the interaction between a firm's financial condition and the consumers it faces is very important. Ignoring this linkage could lead to substantial losses.
