Under blanket advertising, we identify conditions for one firm to choose a high quality product, but because its rival positions close by, it selects a low ad expenditure to avoid fierce price competition. Under targeted advertising, we identify conditions such that both firms choose high quality products, but advertise to different segments. This can result in a middle pocket of unserved consumers.</br>
