<br>Title: Optimal Procurement Auctions of Divisible Goods with Capacitated Suppliers</br><br>Author: Anuj Kumar, Industrial Engineering & Operations Research Department, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States, ak2108@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Garud Iyengar</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Most of the literature, in procurement auctions (reverse auctions) assumes uncapacitated suppliers. Consequently, in a constant marginal production cost model, these auction mechanisms award the contract to a single supplier. We consider a model with capacitated suppliers where, in addition to the privately known marginal costs, the production capacities are also private information. We construct the optimal direct mechanism that maximizes the retailers expected profits in this model. The solution is closed form under {\it regularity}. The results in this paper are applicable to a number of principle-agent mechanism design problems (for example monopoly pricing with adverse selection, forward auctions) where the agents have privately known upper bound on the allocations. The sealed low bid implementation of the optimal direct mechanism is also presented in symmetric environment. The implementation requires that each supplier submit a bid consisting of the marginal payment sought and total capacity available. These bids serve as the input to a simple optimization problem that computes the quantity allocation for each firm. We extend the model to multi-product procurement with complementarities.</br>
