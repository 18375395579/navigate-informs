Title: Subsidizing the Distribution Channel: Donor Funding to Improve the Availability of Malaria Drugs<br>Author: Wenqiang Xiao, NYU, Stern School of Business, NYC, United States of America, wxiao@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Terry Taylor<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the question of whether a donor should subsidize the purchases and/or the sales of the private channel. We show that the donor should only subsidize purchases and should not subsidize sales. This result holds when the product life cycle is long, as is typical for malaria drugs. However, this result breaks when the product life cycle is short. Then, it is optimal to offer a sales subsidy if and only if customer heterogeneity and the donor's budget are sufficiently large.
