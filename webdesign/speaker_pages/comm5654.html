We show that the donor should only subsidize purchases and should not subsidize sales. This result holds when the product life cycle is long, as is typical for malaria drugs. However, this result breaks when the product life cycle is short. Then, it is optimal to offer a sales subsidy if and only if customer heterogeneity and the donor's budget are sufficiently large.</br>
