Title: Bidding Heuristics in Ad Auctions: Convergence to Market Equilibria<br>Author: Nicole Immorlica, CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 6 Purgatory Road, Mont Vernon, NH, 03057, United States of America, nickle@eecs.northwestern.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Omid Etesami, Mohammad Mahdian, Kamal Jain, Christian Borgs, Jennifer Chayes<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study a bidding heuristic for keyword-advertising auctions in which budget-constrained advertisers attempt to optimize utility by equalizing ROI across all keywords. We show that a perturbed first-price mechanism combined with this bidding heuristic provably converges to the unique market equilibrium. Thus, our results can be alternatively described as a tatonnement process for convergence to market equilibrium in which prices are adjusted on the side of the buyers rather than the sellers.
