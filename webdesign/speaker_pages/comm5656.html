<br>Title: Bidding Heuristics in Ad Auctions: Convergence to Market Equilibria</br><br>Author: Nicole Immorlica, CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 6 Purgatory Road, Mont Vernon, NH, 03057, United States of America, nickle@eecs.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Omid Etesami, Mohammad Mahdian, Kamal Jain, Christian Borgs, Jennifer Chayes</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study a bidding heuristic for keyword-advertising auctions in which budget-constrained advertisers attempt to optimize utility by equalizing ROI across all keywords. We show that a perturbed first-price mechanism combined with this bidding heuristic provably converges to the unique market equilibrium. Thus, our results can be alternatively described as a tatonnement process for convergence to market equilibrium in which prices are adjusted on the side of the buyers rather than the sellers.</br>
