Risk aversion and service constraints are taken into account. These constraints may affect the optimal inventory capacity as well as the optimal prices. The effects of the constraints on supply chain performance are compared. The current two-period model leads to complicated and non-trivial solutions and insights, compared with one-period models, found in the literature. Exact analytical formulas are given.</br>
