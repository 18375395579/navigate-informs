Title: Competitive Quality Choice and Remanufacturing<br>Author: Adem Orsdemir, Kenan Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, adem_orsdemir@kenan-flagler.unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Eda Kemahlioglu Ziya, Ali Parlakturk<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider an Original Equipment Manufacturer who faces competition from an Independent Remanufacturer. We explicitly characterize how OEM competes with IR in equilibrium. IR’s entry threat as well as its entry can decrease consumer and social surplus. We show either weak IR or strong IR is desirable for reducing the environmental impact. Comparing our results with benchmarks in which OEM remanufactures suggests that encouraging IRs to remanufacture in lieu of OEMs may not benefit environment.
