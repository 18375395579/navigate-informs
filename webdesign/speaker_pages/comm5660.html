Title: Information Sharing in a Multi-tier Supply Chain with Outsourcing<br>Author: Yulan Wang, Assistant Professor, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, yulan.wang@polyu.edu.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Cheng Ma<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the information sharing incentives in a three-tier supply chain consisting of an OEM, a CM and a supplier under two outsourcing structures, control and delegation by considering two production cost scenarios: production economy and production diseconomy.  We then derived the information sharing equilibria for each combination of the outsourcing structures and production cost situation. We then identify under which situation information sharing can make the supply chain better off.
