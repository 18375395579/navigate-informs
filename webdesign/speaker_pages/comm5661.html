This research considers where multi-store shoppers purchase the items on their shopping lists; specifically, the “common items?that are available at competing stores. Multi-store shoppers purchase some common items at the first store they visit; other common item purchases are deferred to a competing store. These purchase decisions depend on the prices observed at the first store and the uncertainty about saving money by deferring purchase to a competing store. We introduce an analytical model of where multi-store shoppers purchase the common items on their shopping lists that extends the optimal search literature in some important ways: 1) it assumes that multi-store shoppers visit a fixed number of stores--two--rather than searching sequentially without time constraints; 2) it assumes “no recall;?3) it allows prices at the two stores to have different price distributions; and 4) of particular interest, it generalizes the cost minimization objective function commonly used in optimal price search to include psychological benefits from saving money. Analysis of this model shows that, for multi-store shoppers who enjoy psychological benefits from saving money (PB shoppers), the ratio of expected price savings to the variance in price savings drives their purchase decisions. In contrast, for multi-store shoppers motivated only by the rational economic benefits of saving money (REB shoppers), expected savings alone drives purchase decisions. The implication is that PB shoppers are affected by uncertainty in savings while REB shoppers are not. To test empirically for differences in multi-store shoppers?motivations and behaviors, we develop a finite mixture model capable of capturing heterogeneity in responses to price savings. We find that many multi-store shoppers in our sample (38%) appear to be motivated by psychological benefits. Moreover, by pricing in a way that reduces or increases uncertainty about price savings, retailers can affect where these shoppers buy. Thus, our analysis provides a new perspective on the connection between retail pricing and multi-store shopping behavior.
