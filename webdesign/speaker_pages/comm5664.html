A Natural Experiment at Fashion Manufacturer Costis Moros</br><br>Author: Nicole DeHoratius, Nicole.DeHoratius@ChicagoGSB.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Raman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We observe a natural experiment at fashion manufacturer Costis Moros that entails changing the frequency with which orders are placed from monthly to weekly.  This change results in a 30% increase in sales across its retail customers, without controlling for other factors.  We explore what operational advantages arose from this change in order frequency and, with the introduction of controls, assess whether this order change alone accounts for the dramatic increase in sales.  In so doing, we identify the value of being in-stock among upstream parties and provide evidence contrary to classic multi-echelon inventory models that assume stockout costs are incurred only at the lowest echelon.</br>
