<br>Title: Optimization for Time-of-use Control in Electricity Demand Side Management</br><br>Author: David F. Rogers, Associate Professor of Operations and Business Analytics, University of Cincinnati, 2925 Campus Green Dr, 531 Carl H. Lindner Hall, Cincinnati, OH, 45221-0130, United States of America, David.Rogers@UC.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George G. Polak</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Time-of-use pricing of electricity in demand side management requires determining the time periods of a day that should be grouped for identical pricing. Integer & constraint programming models to find clusters of contiguous periods potentially with a “wrap-around?feature for which time periods at both the beginning and end of the day may be in the same cluster are examined. A real-world data set consisting of kwh usage for 93 buildings was employed for testing the models.</br>
