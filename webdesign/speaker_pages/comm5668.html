We develop a model that includes bidding pool defection and analyze the characteristics of policies that perform well in the presence of defection. We simulate traditional policies and compare their performance in the presence of bidding pool defection to a policy developed specifically for defection. We show that when defection is present, existing policies perform poorly.
