Title: Equilibrium Prices from MIPs: Applications to Unit Commitment and Electric Capacity Expansion<br>Author: David Fuller, Professor, University of Waterloo, Department of Management Sciences, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, Canada, dfuller@uwaterloo.ca<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Market equilibrium models with continuous and binary variables may have no solution if prices are only for continuous variable commodities. O’Neill et al. proposed prices for continuous commodities and binary variables, but their proposal has shortcomings: the possibility that some prices are negative; possibly unfair price discrimination; and an incomplete treatment of the fact that all revenues paid to producers must be collected from consumers. Resolutions of these shortcomings are discussed.
