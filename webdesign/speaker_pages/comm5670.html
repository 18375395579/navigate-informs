We examine the effectiveness of three outsourcing structures currently implemented by top-tier OEMs. We characterize each party’s optimal decision and the intermediary party's information distortion behavior under each structure. We then compare each party’s profit across three outsourcing structures and identify who benefits and when.</br>
