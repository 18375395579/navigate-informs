The rights, called border flow rights, support financial hedging of transmission risk and merchant transmission expansion through associated financial rights, contracts for differences of differences. These financial rights allow for forward trading of both energy and transmission by a unified exchange. We consider incentive properties of such a right in the absence of lumpiness, economies of scale, and market power.</br>
