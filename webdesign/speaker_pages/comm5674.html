We show strategic customer have consequences on the optimal pricing of monopolists that are themselves strategic and time-consistent. While mark-down pricing is always optimal for a large class of models of heterogeneous preferences commonly used in the discrete choice literature, we find that mark-up pricing might be optimal when buyers are time-inconsistent.</br>
