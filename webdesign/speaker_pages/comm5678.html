Title: To Share or Not to Share? Contract Structures for Capacity investments in Shared Suppliers<br>Author: Anyan Qi, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan St., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, anyqi@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyun-Soo Ahn, Amitabh Sinha<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study contracts governing capacity investment in shared suppliers. Two types of contract are considered: exclusive, where unused capacity cannot be used for others, and flexible, where it can. We find that firms generally pursue exclusive contracts, resulting in a prisoners?dilemma, and in equilibrium it is possible that only one firm invests in flexible capacity, and allows others to free-ride. Our work suggests an opportunity for the firms to co-operate to achieve a pareto-optimal outcome.
