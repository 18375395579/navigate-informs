Title: Design of Partially Flexible Systems for Substitutable Products<br>Author: Betul Lus, Graduate Student, University of Massachusetts, 160 Governors Drive, Elab 213 A, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, blus@acad.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ana Muriel<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We explore the design of production networks under demand uncertainty, pricing flexibility and product substitution. The production of substitutable products in different plants helps the firm improve its performance by diverting demand from one product to its substitute, and thus from one plant to another, through pricing.  We show that production network designs that exploit product substitution in this way result in higher profits and require lower capacity investments.
