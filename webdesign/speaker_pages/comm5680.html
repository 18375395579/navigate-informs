We pay particular attention to upstream and downstream linkages in the vertical supply chain. We analyze economic forces in the supply chain that influence business location decisions. Of particular interest are the downstream aluminum fabrication industries, and factors such as technological improvements, energy costs, and labor force issues which affect the extent of foreign competition and outsourcing.</br>
