Title: Enhancing Flexibility by Integrating Product Recovery in Spare Parts Procurement<br>Author: Karl Inderfurth, Professor, University of Magdeburg, Universitaetsplatz 2, Magdeburg, D-39106, Germany, Karl.Inderfurth@WW.Uni-Magdeburg.DE<br>Coauthor(s): Rainer Kleber<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Product recovery gains increasing importance in spare parts acquisition, especially during the service period after end-of-production. Considering product recovery in addition to traditional procurement options (final order, extra production) makes the underlying stochastic dynamic planning problem highly complex. An efficient heuristic for problem solving is developed and used to evaluate and measure the contribution to procurement flexibility that can be expected from product recovery.
