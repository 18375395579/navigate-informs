<br>Title: Optimal Pricing and Inventory in Product Rollovers</br><br>Author: Gilvan Souza, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, gsouza@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eylem Koca, Cheryl Druehl</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study product rollovers (single and dual roll) strategies and its impact on optimal pricing and inventory.  Using optimal control theory, the firm finds the optimal final build quantity and price pattern for the older product generation, and the price pattern for the new product generation.  We show that capacity plays a key role in product rollover management.  The best overall strategy can be identified numerically.</br>
