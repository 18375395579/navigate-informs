<br>Title: Tactical Supply Chain Planning under Supplier Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Aly Megahed, Ph.D. Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, aly@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc Goetschalckx</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a comprehensive tactical supply chain planning model for multi-echelon, multi-period, and multi-commodity supply chains that incorporates supplier uncertainty in its most general form. It is modeled as a two-stage stochastic programming model. We show both theoretical and numerical results for the effect of supplier uncertainty on procurement decisions. We also apply our model to a real-world wind turbines supply chain</br>
