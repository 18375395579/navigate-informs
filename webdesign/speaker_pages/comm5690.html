Title: Pricing of Limited Inventories with Market Segments and Imperfect Customer Identification<br>Author: Goker Aydin, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States, ayding@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Serhan Ziya<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the possibility of charging prices that are adjusted according to customer-specific information (a customer signal) as well as time and inventory.  Such customization is effective as long as the seller can identify the customer as belonging to a certain market segment, an identification that is not always perfect. We find conditions under which a signal is a meaningful input to pricing decisions. We investigate how the benefits from price customization depend on inventory and time.
