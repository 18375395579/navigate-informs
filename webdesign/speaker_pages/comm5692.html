<br>Title: Hierarchical Customization of Product Assortments under Ranking-based Consumer Choice</br><br>Author: Roger Lederman, IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, rdlederm@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Denis Saure</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study assortment-planning settings where consumers engage in a multi-stage selling process and product assortments are presented in an incremental fashion. Incremental information about consumer preferences is obtained and can be used to customize product offerings in later stages. We address computation of optimal assortment policies and quantify the value of hierarchical customization in consumer screening and inventory rationing.</br>
