<br>Title: Wine Futures and Advance Selling under Quality Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Tim Noparumpa, Assistant Professor, Providence College, Providence College School of Business, Koffler Hall, Providence, RI, United States of America, tnoparum@syr.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Burak Kazaz, Scott Webster</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We examine the use of wine futures as a form of operational flexibility to mitigate quality-rating risk in wine production. As the wine ages in barrels, the firm has to determine what proportion of its wine should be sold as futures, and what proportion should be sold in retail. While advance selling enables the firm to recuperate the investment early and pass on the risk of holding inventory that is uncertain in value to consumers, it can also lead to smaller returns than retail revenues.</br>
