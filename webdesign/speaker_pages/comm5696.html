An crucial complication in many settings is that the firm does not even have full information about the distribution of demand or supply random variable (i.e., ambiguity). Managers therefore have to produce (“do? while learning about the random demand or supply. We  present a new data-driven approach to production planning when there is ambiguity about the underlying distribution of a relevant random variable.
