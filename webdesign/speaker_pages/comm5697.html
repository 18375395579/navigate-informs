Title: On the Effect of Consumer Heterogeneity and Channel Structure in Optimal Product Design<br>Author: Jeremy Michalek, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Scaife Hall 323, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, jmichalek@cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ching-Shin Shiau<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We examine conditions for optimal new product design in an oligopoly under alternative retail channel structures and demand model specifications. We find that homogeneous consumer preferences (logit) cause decoupling of design and market decisions, while heterogeneity (mixed logit) and price-attribute preference interactions lead to interdependencies. We also find that ignoring competitive reactions can lead to severe overestimation of profit and suboptimal decisions.
