We find that homogeneous consumer preferences (logit) cause decoupling of design and market decisions, while heterogeneity (mixed logit) and price-attribute preference interactions lead to interdependencies. We also find that ignoring competitive reactions can lead to severe overestimation of profit and suboptimal decisions.</br>
