On average, street trees add $7,020 to sales price and reduce time on the market by 1.9 days. The benefits of street trees spill over to neighboring houses, which implies that if the provision and maintenance of street trees is left solely to homeowners then there will probably be too few street trees in Portland from a community perspective.</br>
