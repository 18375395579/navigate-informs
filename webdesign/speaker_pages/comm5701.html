Title: The Effect of Earmarked Funding on Fleet Management for Relief and Development<br>Author: Maria Besiou, Kuehne Logistics University - THE KLU, Brooktorkai 20, Hamburg, 20457, Germany, Maria.Besiou@the-klu.org<br>Coauthor(s): Luk Van Wassenhove, Alfonso Pedraza Martinez<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: International Humanitarian Organizations (IHO) often implement relief and development programs simultaneously, their operations can be decentralized and their funding can be earmarked. Using system dynamics we find that due to the interaction of dual mission and earmarked funding, a system with local procurement and a short lead time may consistently take longer to supply transportation for disaster response than a system with global procurement and high lead time.
