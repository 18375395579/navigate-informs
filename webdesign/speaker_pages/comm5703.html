Title: Codesharing Types and Liberalization Agreements: Effects on Frequency and Pricing<br>Author: Nicole Adler, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, 91905, Israel, msnic@huji.ac.il<br>Coauthor(s): Benny Mantin<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Governments sign liberalization agreements to regulate the airborne traffic between two countries, whereas airlines engage in codeshare contracts to set the level of coordination and pooling of resources. Empirically studying their effects on international non-stop routes, we find that the level of liberalization has a significant impact on frequency, and that ‘free sale?contracts decrease airfares whereas ‘block?codeshares have the opposite effect.
