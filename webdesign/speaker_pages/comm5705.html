Title: A Price-Dependent Demand Substitution Rule with Applications to joint Pricing and Inventory Game<br>Author: Ye Lu, MIT, 77 Mass.

In this paper, we use an axiomatic approach to characterize a price-dependent demand substitution rule, and give a sufficient and necessary condition for demand models where our demand substitution rule applies. We use this demand substitution rule to study joint pricing and inventory game. We also extend the existing work in the literature for pricing game.
