Orders can be placed at any time, and the replenishment cost has both fixed and variable components.  At the end of the product’s life cycle, leftover has salvage value and shortage incurs penalty cost. Examples of such products exist in retailing, hi-tech products, and healthcare.     We first propose an optimal replenishment policy for a single retailer location, and then expand to include the case with one supplier and many retailers.</br>
