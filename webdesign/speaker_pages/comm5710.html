Sustainability in also includes reliability of supply from marginal farmers. We use a model where the leader has the ability to offer contracts to any other member of the chain. Our model shows that by directly offering contracts to the input producer, the supply chain leader can promote sustainability; in many cases the chain efficiency also increases.
