However, a standardized fleet may lack flexibility in terms of payload and range given a complex route structure, thus limiting revenue potential. A set of fleet standardization indices for US carriers is developed to examine how standardization affects costs and profitability. Results show that standardization reduces costs but also reduces revenues.  The net effect on profitability depends on the cost-revenue tradeoff.</br>
