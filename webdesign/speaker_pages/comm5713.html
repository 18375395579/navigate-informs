<br>Title: A Structural Model for Asset Price Contagion and Systemic Risk</br><br>Author: Chen Chen, Columbia University, 500 W. 120th St., Mudd 323,, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, chenchen05@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Garud Iyengar, Ciamac Moallemi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a structural model for the analysis of systemic risk in financial markets based on asset price contagion. Specifically, we describe a mechanism of contagion where exogenous random shocks to agents in an economy force portfolio rebalancing. This creates an endogenous chain reaction as agents trade in reaction to price changes. Our approach allows us to quantify the effect of attributes such as leverage and portfolio diversity on asset price contagion.</br>
