With non-linear demand and the retailer¡¯s cost asymmetric information, a revenue sharing contract is proposed in a regular scenario. After retailer¡¯s cost is disrupted, we obtain the optimal emergency strategies of supply chain by considering deviation cost. We illustrate the results by numerical examples.</br>
