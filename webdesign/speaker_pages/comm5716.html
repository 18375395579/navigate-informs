<br>Title: Equilibrium Bidding in Unit Commitment Auctions</br><br>Author: Ramteen Sioshansi, University of California, Berkeley, Industrial Engineering and Operations Re, 1117 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1777, United States of America, ramteen@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Emma Nicholson</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The efficiency ranking and incentive properties of centralized and decentralized unit commitment remains an open question. While centralized commitment can find the most efficient dispatch, the auction mechanism used to solicit generator data is thought to provide poor incentives. Decentralized commitment will suffer coordination losses but may have better incentive properties. We analyze a simple equilibrium model and compare the generator incentives and settlement costs of the two regimes.</br>
