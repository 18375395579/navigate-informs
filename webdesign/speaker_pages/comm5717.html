We find out that the Generalized Nash-Bargaining problem leads to a unique equilibrium price and characterize the optimal launch time in closed form. The manufacturer may find it optimal to launch the product “immediately? delay it or not introduce it at all. We then study the price competition between the firm and local generics.
