Title: Subsidizing a Supply Chain to Facilitate Coordination<br>Author: Nicolas Stier-Moses, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, Uris Hall 418, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, stier@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Maille<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: It is well known that self-interested agents may introduce inefficiencies in a supply chain. We consider a mechanism based on subsidies that allows agents to redistribute the gains arising from a coordinated solution. Indeed, the budget for subsidies comes from the savings arising from the more efficient solution. The main insight is that the inefficiency of an equilibrium can be reduced by the correct selection of subsidies.
