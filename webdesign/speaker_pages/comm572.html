When there is no secondary market for a product, a firm can base the amount of a trade-in rebate on the customer's willingness-to-pay rather than on the condition of the returned unit since the customer lacks a reference.  If the firm decides to sell remanufactured units, she loses this ability to perfectly price discriminate.  We analytically study this trade-off.</br>
