Demand in each period is additive. Pricing and ordering decisions are made at the beginning of each period and all shortages are backlogged.  Ordering cost is a concave function of the amount ordered. We show that under certain conditions that the generalized (s,S) inventory policy maximizing expected profit over the finite horizon.
