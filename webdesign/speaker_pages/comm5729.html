<br>Title: How Inventory Is (Should Be) Financed: Trade Credit in Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Song Alex Yang, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Sussex Place, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, sayang@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Birge</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: As an integrated part of a supply contract, trade credit has intrinsic connections with supply chain contracting and inventory management. Using a model that explicitly captures the interaction of firms?operations decisions and financial risks, this paper attempts to develop a deeper understanding of trade credit from an operational perspective. Using a sample of firm-level data from Compustat, we find that the inventory financing pattern our model predicts exists in a wide range of firms.</br>
