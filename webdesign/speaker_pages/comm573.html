<br>Title: Optimal Auctions for Spiteful Bidders</br><br>Author: Pingzhong Tang, Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Dept, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, kenshin@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tuomas Sandholm</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We derive the optimal auction for spiteful (and altruistic) bidders. It chooses an allocation that maximizes bidders?generalized virtual valuations. The payment rule is less intuitive. It takes each bidder’s own report into consideration. Bidders pay even if the seller keeps the item. The auction sometimes subsidizes losers when another bidder wins. We derive a revenue equivalence and present a template for comparing the revenues of any auctions that have the same allocation rule for the prior.</br>
