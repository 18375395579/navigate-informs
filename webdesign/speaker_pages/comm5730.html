<br>Title: Effects of Competition on PBM Profitability in Drug Distribution: Rebates and Price Spreads</br><br>Author: Yixuan Xiao, Washington University in St. Louis, One Brookings Drive, Campus Box 1133, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States of America, xiaoy@wustl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis, Nan Yang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We model the competition among Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) for the patronage of a client organization. Each PBM determines prices to be charged to the client for branded and generic drugs (price decision) and assigns branded drugs to preferred or non-preferred formulary tiers (formulary decision). Drug manufacturers offer rebates to PBMs for drugs on preferred tier. We show the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium on prices and formulary decisions, and study the impact of model primitives.</br>
