The supplier has a fixed capacity that is shared by both retailers' orders.   Retailers have the option to place an advance order. Later, after uncertainty is resolved, they can increase their order size if they wish. At both ordering points, the supplier applies the uniform allocation rule to distribute capacity to retailers. We characterize the equilibrium behavior of this supply chain game.</br>
