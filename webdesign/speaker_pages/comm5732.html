We analyze the difficulties of incentivizing flexible generation in a model of a dynamic electricity market with capacity and ramping costs. We show that average prices coincide with average marginal costs of capacity. Hence, ramping costs are not covered by the market. If the market includes a ramping price, then the competitive equilibrium is no longer unique. We give a complete characterization of possible prices.</br>
