Upon arrival, each utility-maximizer consumer  must decide either to buy at the full price, or to place a non-withdrawable reservation at a discount price and wait until the end of the sales season where the leftover units are allocated according to an “earlier reservations first?priority. We characterize cases where this scheme provides benefits over the usual markdown practice.
