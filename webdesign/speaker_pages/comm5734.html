Title: Risk Bounds and Near-Optimal Algorithms in Revenue Management with Unknown Demand Function<br>Author: Omar Besbes, PhD Student, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, ob2105@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Assaf Zeevi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a single product revenue management problem where realized demand is observed over time, but the demand function that governs these observations is not known. We define different information levels that characterize the a priori knowledge of the decision maker, and provide lower and upper bounds on the optimal performance of joint learning and pricing schemes. These results illustrate the risk-reward tradeoff with regard to the assumptions made on the underlying demand model.
