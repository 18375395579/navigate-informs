Title: Network Neutrality from Agency Perspective<br>Author: Jean Walrand, Prof. of EECS, University of CA, Berkeley, 257M Cory Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, wlr@EECS.Berkeley.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): John Musacchio, Galina Schwartz<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of network neutrality on provider incentives when investment irreversibility is present. At the aggregate level, we model the network as a monopolistically competitive industry (Dixit-Stiglitz (1977)), which produces a variety of goods. Each variety is produced by two providers (transit and content), who share the surplus. We model the network as a collection of simultaneous surplus sharing games, in which provider interactions are subject of a hold-up problem.
