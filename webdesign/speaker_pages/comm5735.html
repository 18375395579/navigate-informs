At the aggregate level, we model the network as a monopolistically competitive industry (Dixit-Stiglitz (1977)), which produces a variety of goods. Each variety is produced by two providers (transit and content), who share the surplus. We model the network as a collection of simultaneous surplus sharing games, in which provider interactions are subject of a hold-up problem.</br>
