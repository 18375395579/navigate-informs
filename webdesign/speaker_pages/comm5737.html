<br>Title: Procurement Strategies for Multiple Inputs</br><br>Author: Pascale Crama, Singapore Management University, 50 Stamford Road, Singapore, 78899, Singapore, pcrama@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Onur Boyabatli</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the procurement decision of a firm that produces a single commodity output using two commodity inputs. The firm can source the two inputs in advance of the selling season through long-term contracts or from the spot markets. We investigate the impact of using different contract types (fixed-price versus index-priced) on the profitability of the firm. The main motivation comes from a soda ash producer located in India that procures multiple commodity inputs for production.</br>
