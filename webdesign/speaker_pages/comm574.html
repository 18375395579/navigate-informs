Specifically, we consider a  supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer in newsvendor  settings. In addition to regular supply, the manufacturer may offer a backup supply to satisfy demand not met by the retailer. We study when to offer backup supply, how it affects regular supply and overall supply chain profit.</br>
