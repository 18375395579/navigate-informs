Title: Price-only Contract with Backup Supply<br>Author: Yao Zhao, Rutgers University, 180 University Ave, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States, yaozhao@andromeda.rutgers.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xiaowei Xu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We explore a new potential way to mitigate the ``double  marginalization effect by a backup supply. Specifically, we consider a  supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer in newsvendor  settings. In addition to regular supply, the manufacturer may offer a backup supply to satisfy demand not met by the retailer. We study when to offer backup supply, how it affects regular supply and overall supply chain profit.
