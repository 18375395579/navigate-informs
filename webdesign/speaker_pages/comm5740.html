Each airline tries to maximize expected revenue from an initial, finite inventory of seats over a finite time horizon. The price point structure is the same for both.  Customers seek the lowest price in the market; when the prices match they make a random choice.  We allow a nonzero probability that a customer does not buy.  All necessary probabilities are known to each airline and the price points can change at each customer request.</br>
