Title: Real-time Optimization of Personalized Assortments<br>Author: Hamid Nazerzadeh, Assistant Professor, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, hamidnz@marshall.usc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Negin Golrezaei, Paat Rusmevichientong<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of personalizing the assortment of products to each arriving customer. Through actual sales data from an online retailer, we demonstrate that personalization based on each customer's location can lead to over 10% improvements in revenue, compared to a policy that treats all customers the same. We propose a family of index-based policies with performance guarantee that effectively coordinate the real-time assortment decisions with the backend supply chain constraints.
