Title: Joint Pricing and Ordering Decisions Under Satisfaction Guaranteed Sales<br>Author: Yalcin Akcay, Koc University, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, Sariyer, Istanbul, 34450, Turkey, yakcay@ku.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Tamer Boyaci<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Satisfaction Guaranteed (SG) is a returns policy in which customers can take products that do not meet their expectations back to the seller for refund. We show that SG policy is not simply a marketing gimmick.  By re-selling returned items as open-box products at discount prices, the firm can tap in the segment of more price-sensitive customers, allowing the firm to price-discriminate consumers. We develop a framework of SG sales that jointly optimizes product prices and order quantities.
