Title: Optimal Market-making with Risk Aversion<br>Author: David Simchi-Levi, Professor, MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave. Rm. 1-171, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, dslevi@MIT.EDU<br>Coauthor(s): Miao Song, Kan Huang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Market-makers have the obligation to trade securities at quoted bid or ask prices, and their inventories are exposed to the potential loss when the market price moves in an undesirable direction. One approach to reduce this risk is to adjust the inventory at the price of losing potential spread gain. We show that a threshold inventory control policy is optimal with respect to an exponential utility criterion, and more general results are obtained for mean-variance analysis.
