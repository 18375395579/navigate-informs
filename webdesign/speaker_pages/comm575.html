Downstream firms may also need to invest to be able to use them. We investigate the effects of different industry and firm factors on the complementary R&D investments of two tiers of oligopolies. These investments improve the upstream technology and the final products?capabilities. We discuss which supply chain structures are more conducive to product innovations.
