Title: Product Line Design in a Supply Chain Network<br>Author: Nan Xia, Sheldon B. Lubar School of Business, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States of America, xian@uwm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sampath (Raj) Rajagopalan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate product line decisions for a monopoly producer who sells goods to multiple retailers. Retailers have incentives for offering more variety to attract customers, but whether the producer who incurs most of the associated costs could benefit from increased variety is unclear. We derive the producer's optimal strategies of product variety/complexity and pricing using a framework that captures retailers' strategic behaviors.
