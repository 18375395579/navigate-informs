Title: Locational Tying of Complementary Retail Items<br>Author: Ebru Bish, Associate Professor, Virginia Tech, Dept. of Industrial and Systems Engg., Blacksburg, VA, 24061-0118, United States of America, ebru@vt.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Bacel Maddah<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study the benefits of locational tying  (LT), a cross-category selling strategy involving two complementary items: a primary item and a secondary item. The retailer stimulates demand for the primary item by offering the secondary item in close proximity to it. We characterize the structure of the optimal prices and inventory decisions under LT, compare it to the traditional selling strategy, where the two items are sold independently, and derive managerial insights.
