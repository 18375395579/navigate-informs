Title: A Larger Slice or a Larger Pie? Investigating Bargaining Power in the Distribution Channel<br>Author: Michaela Draganska, Stanford University, Graduate School of Business, Stanford, CA, United States of America, draganska_michaela@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sofia Villas-Boas, Daniel Klapper<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We investigate the determinants of channel profitability and the relative power in the channel by considering consumer demand and the interactions between manufacturers and retailers in an equilibrium model. In a departure from the standard literature, which assumes that manufacturers set wholesale prices unilaterally, we model the negotiations between manufacturers and retailers using a Nash bargaining game. The model is estimated using data for the German ground coffee industry.
