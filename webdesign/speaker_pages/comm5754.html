Stern School of Business, 44 West 4th Street, KMC 8-93, New York, NY, 10012, United States, arun@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ke-Wei Huang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We model the optimal pricing of on-demand computing taking four critical factors into account: the costs of deploying IT in-house, the business value of this IT, the scale of the provider's infrastructure, and the variable costs of providing on-demand computing. Three distinct pricing models emerge as optimal among all possible pricing functions, which describe when volume discounting, free usage and demand caps should be used to manage demand appropriately and profitably.</br>
