<br>Title: Revenue Management of Perishable Products Under Competition</br><br>Author: Benny Mantin, Sauder School Business, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 2C1, Canada, benny.mantin@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Granot, Frieda Granot</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a multi-period no-replenishment model of competition between retailers. Consumers return to the same retailer with probability P and purchase an identical good once price is below their valuations. We find that prices decline exponentially as long as P is not too close to 1, consumers?surplus is maximized when they zigzag between retailers, and changing monopoly to duopoly dramatically affects prices, while further intensifying competition to oligopoly marginally affects prices.</br>
