If a customer defaults on its lease, the manufacturer will have to resell the used aircraft in the secondary market. The manufacturer is thus exposed to the risk of declining prices for used equipment, as well as credit risk. The manufacturer is also exposed to the interest rate risk. We develop a three-factor model to value and risk manage aircraft leases subject to credit, asset, and interest rate risk.</br>
