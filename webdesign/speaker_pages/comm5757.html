<br>Title: Partial Complementarity, Strategic Decision and Performance of Firms in Decentralized Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Xiang Fang, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, xiang.fang@case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yunzeng Wang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Consider multiple manufacturers each producing a different product. The manufacturers rely on each other to fulfill a common demand stream from a type of customers who buy the multiple products as complementary sets. In addition, each manufacturer faces a separate customer type who buys only the manufacturer’s own product. All streams of demands are uncertain. We explore the equilibrium behavior of manufacturers in choosing their individual production capacities or quantities.</br>
