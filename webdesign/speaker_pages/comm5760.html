Hence, the authorities offer different kinds of incentives for people to become vaccinated such as subsidizing vaccination or placing vaccination centers in malls to make the process more accessible. We built a theoretical epidemiological game model to find the optimal incentive for vaccination and the corresponding expected level of vaccination coverage. The model was supported by survey data from questionnaires regarding people’s perceptions about influenza and the vaccination against it. Result suggest that the optimal magnitude of the incentives should be greater when less contagious seasonal strains of influenza are involved and in regions where vaccination coverage is expected to be higher. The optimal incentive should be also greater for the nonelderly population rather than the elderly, and should rise as high as $57 per vaccinated individual so that all children between the ages of six months and four years will be vaccinated.
