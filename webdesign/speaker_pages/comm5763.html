When a global company introduces a new product to the market, there is no past data to accurately calibrate the demand distribution. We use a Bayesian scheme to learn about the demand distribution based on historical demand/sales data and make operational decisions dynamically that optimize the performance of a global supply chain in a multi-period problem.</br>
