Title: Global Supply Chain Management with Unknown Demand Distribution<br>Author: Arnab Bisi, Assistant Professor of Management, Purdue University, 403 W. State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, abisi@purdue.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Maqbool Dada<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We address the optimal procurement and distribution policies for managing global supply chains of both seasonal and non-seasonal products. When a global company introduces a new product to the market, there is no past data to accurately calibrate the demand distribution. We use a Bayesian scheme to learn about the demand distribution based on historical demand/sales data and make operational decisions dynamically that optimize the performance of a global supply chain in a multi-period problem.
