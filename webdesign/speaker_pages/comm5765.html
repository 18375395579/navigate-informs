Title: Impact of Product Substitution/Complementarity on Prices and Capacity and Flexibility Investments<br>Author: Betul Lus, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 160 Governors Drive, Amherst, MA, United States, blus@acad.umass.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ana Muriel<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We compare two alternative measures of product substitutability/complementarity for linear demand functions that are commonly used in the literature in a variety of price/quantity decision and capacity investment problems. Using the right measure of product substitutability, we find that the optimal investment in manufacturing flexibility for a monopoly firm tends to decrease as the products become closer substitutes/complements and identify the conditions under which it increases.
