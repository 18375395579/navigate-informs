<br>Title: The Impact of Supplier Pricing on Manufacturers?Replacement of a Substance of Concern</br><br>Author: Tim Kraft, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia, Darden School of Business, Charlottesville, VA, United States of America, kraftt@darden.virginia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gal Raz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we analyze how a supplier can influence the adoption of a replacement for a substance of concern. We consider the impact of the existing regulatory threat, market sensitivity, and supplier price. As extensions we consider: 1) a scenario where firms can collaborate to replace the substance and 2) a setting in which the supplier first targets an alpha customer before offering the replacement to the entire industry.</br>
