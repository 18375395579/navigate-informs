Title: A Transaction Cost Economics Model of Vertical Integration Drivers for Remanufacturing Operations<br>Author: Pinar Martin, Bocconi University, Milan, Italy, pinarmartin@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Guide<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Despite recent attention to closed-loop supply chains, there is scant information about organizational design for OEMs engaging in remanufacturing. Based on literature and six case studies we propose a framework for vertical integration. Results show that brand name and IP are powerful drivers favoring vertical integration. We also find that forward outsourcing activities can have a profound impact on the profitability of OEMs.
