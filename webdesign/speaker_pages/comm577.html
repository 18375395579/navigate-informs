We designed an experiment to examine how a shift from a decentralized referral system, characterized by a close relationship between general practitioners and specialists, to a centralized referral system would affect referral rate. The results indicated that high confidence doctors referred significantly fewer patients in a close-relationship condition in comparison with the centralized referral system.
