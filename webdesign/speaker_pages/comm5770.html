Title: Who Has the Hot Product? Competing for Strategic Consumers When Market Share is Uncertain<br>Author: Robert Swinney, Doctoral Student, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut St. Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, rswinney@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gerard Cachon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider competition between two firms that produce horizontally differentiated products with uncertain consumer value. Consumers may purchase an item early, before value has been realized, or late.  Firms produce inventory prior to learning their individual market shares.  We find equilibrium consumer and firm behavior, and consider how the ability of a firm to quickly react to updated demand information by producing additional inventory (quick response) affects the game.
