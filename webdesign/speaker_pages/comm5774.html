Title: The Value of the Price Envelope<br>Author: Bahadir Aral, SAS Institute, SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC, 27511, United States of America, Bahadir.Aral@sas.com<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: In Business-to-Business pricing (B2B pricing) the price recommendation is often provided in the form of a price envelope. This is a series of reference points that supports the seller in negotiating the price. Examples of such reference points are the triple of a starting price, a target price, and a floor price.  There are some practical and intuitive reasons for this approach, but in this paper we show the value by means of a simulation.
