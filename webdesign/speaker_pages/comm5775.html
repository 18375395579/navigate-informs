Title: Competing Retailers and Inventory: An Empirical Study of U.S. Auto Dealerships<br>Author: Marcelo Olivares, Assistant Professor, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, Uris Hall #417, New York, NY, 10027, United States, molivares@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Gerard Cachon<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We estimate empirically the effect of local competition on inventory holdings of U.S. automobile dealerships. Competition can affect inventory through two mechanisms: (1)by influencing dealers demand; (2) by affecting the buffer stock that retailers choose to carry. Using cross-sectional variation across geographically isolated markets, we estimate the effect of sales and local competition on inventory. We find a strong positive non-linear effect of competition on service level.
