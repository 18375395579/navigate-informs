Competition can affect inventory through two mechanisms: (1)by influencing dealers demand; (2) by affecting the buffer stock that retailers choose to carry. Using cross-sectional variation across geographically isolated markets, we estimate the effect of sales and local competition on inventory. We find a strong positive non-linear effect of competition on service level.</br>
