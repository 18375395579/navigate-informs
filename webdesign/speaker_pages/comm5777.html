Title: Optimal Pricing for a Short Life-cycle Product When Customer Price-sensitivity Varies Over Time<br>Author: Hongmin Li, Arizona State University, W.P. Carey School of Business, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, Hongmin.Li@asu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tim Huh<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Demand for technology products often resembles a diffusion process, with weak demand in the beginning and end of the life cycle and high demand intensity in between. The customer price-sensitivity also changes over the life cycle of the product. We study the pre-announced pricing decision for a product that exhibits such demand characteristics and determine the optimal set of discrete prices and the times to switch from one price to another, when a limited number of price changes are allowed.
