We establish the relationship between weekly sales performance of a retailer with respect to weekly store traffic, labor force deployment, and intra-day traffic variability. We devise a strategy to allocate limited funds for advertising, early-bird promotions, and labor force for weekly operation in order to maximize store profit.</br>
