Title: Dynamic Inventory Games with Substitution<br>Author: Rodney Parker, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect St, New Haven, CT, 06520-8200, United States of America, rodney.parker@yale.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Tava Olsen<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider multi-period stochastic games involving substitutable inventory and study when the equilibrium behavior is consistent with that observed in the equivalent static game. For inventory substitution games, we show the sustained equilibrium inventory policy is base-stock and when compared to the integrated firm, there is greater overall inventory holding but individual firms may stock less.
