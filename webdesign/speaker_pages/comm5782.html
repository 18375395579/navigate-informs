Parrilo<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Multi-item iterative auctions are commonly employed in practice, for instance in the context of spectrum auctions and procurement auctions, often without efficiency guarantees. In this work, we focus on a special but realistic class of valuation functions, which we refer to as graphical valuations, and develop simple efficient iterative auctions. The auctions we provide are applicable in various practical environments and allow for items that exhibit value complementarity and substitutability.
