<br>Title: Semi-parametric Estimation of Ticket Purchases at a Theater</br><br>Author: Necati Tereyagoglu, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Management, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, necati.tereyagoglu@scheller.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Senthil Veeraraghavan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a semi-parametric competing proportional hazard framework that models the dynamic effects of an organization's show and time related pricing decisions on the customer's propensity to purchase a ticket for a variety of shows during a specified timeframe. We test our model on ticket sales and seat pricing data for a season of 21 concerts from a leading performing arts organization. We suggest a discounting policy using these estimates.</br>
