<br>Title: Dynamic Acceptance Sampling Plans in a Supply Chain with Endogenous Product Quality</br><br>Author: Tian Ni, PhD student, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, ni10@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaowei Xu, Hong Wan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This article studies a firm that procures a product from a supplier in a repeated setting. In each period, based on the historical public information the firm determines the optimal acceptance sampling plan and the supplier strategically determines the quality effort level. Internal product failure and external product failure coexist in our model. Sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of Nash equilibrium are also provided.</br>
