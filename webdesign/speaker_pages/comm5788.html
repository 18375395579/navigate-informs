Title: Coordination Via Discounts and Rebates in a Two-level System with Lot-sizing Cost Structures<br>Author: Joseph Geunes, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, geunes@ise.ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Wilco van den Heuvel, Yusen Xia, Xiangtong Qi, Edwin Romeijn<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a two-stage decentralized supply chain where a supplier serves a retailer with a single item. Both stages face fixed order costs and linear procurement and holding costs over a finite horizon. We analyze the use of rebates, wholesale price discounts, and holding cost subsidies for improving supply chain efficiency in the presence of an uncooperative retailer.  Using an efficiency metric, we evaluate the potential for these simple mechanisms to achieve operations coordination.
