Both stages face fixed order costs and linear procurement and holding costs over a finite horizon. We analyze the use of rebates, wholesale price discounts, and holding cost subsidies for improving supply chain efficiency in the presence of an uncooperative retailer.  Using an efficiency metric, we evaluate the potential for these simple mechanisms to achieve operations coordination.</br>
