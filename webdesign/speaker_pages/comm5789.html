Dual sourcing encourages competition and reduces informational rent paid to a supplier, but it may increase total informational rent paid by the manufacturer. We find conditions under which dual sourcing enhances the value of perfect information for the manufacturer. Compared to sole sourcing, dual sourcing may increase the quantity risk of the manufacturer.</br>
