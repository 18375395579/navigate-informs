Title: Supply Disruptions, Asymmetric Information, and Dual Sourcing<br>Author: Zhibin Yang, zhibiny@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Goker Aydin, Damian Beil, Volodymyr Babich<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We examine how the manufacturer uses dual sourcing and supplier backup production under asymmetric information about supplier reliability. Dual sourcing encourages competition and reduces informational rent paid to a supplier, but it may increase total informational rent paid by the manufacturer. We find conditions under which dual sourcing enhances the value of perfect information for the manufacturer. Compared to sole sourcing, dual sourcing may increase the quantity risk of the manufacturer.
