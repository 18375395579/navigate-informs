Title: Revenue Management with Costly Price Adjustments<br>Author: Sabri Celik, Columbia University, sc2190@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alp Muharremoglu, Sergei Savin<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study the problem of dynamic pricing of inventories in the presence of price adjustment costs. In many retail settings, changing the price involves extra costs, be it through the re-labeling of inventories or advertising the price change to customers. We formulate the problem as a finite horizon dynamic program and describe structural properties of the optimal policy. We introduce several fluid-based heuristics and establish their asymptotic optimality.
