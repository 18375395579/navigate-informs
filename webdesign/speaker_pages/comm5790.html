Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, chenming@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zhi-Long Chen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a markdown pricing problem with two dependent products.

We propose a solution approach for maximizing the revenue under the worst-case demand scenario.
