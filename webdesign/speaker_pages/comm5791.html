<br>Title: Stochastic Model for Limit Order Book with Asymptotic Analysis</br><br>Author: Xinyun Chen, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, 323 Mudd Building, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, xc2177@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jose Blanchet</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The new abstract is: We develop a stochastic model for the limit order book that describe the joint evolution of the full order book and the stock price. We show that our model is able to capture stylizing features of limit order book from empirical observations. In the end, we show that our model leads to a jump diffusion approximation for the stock price.</br>
