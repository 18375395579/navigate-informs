Title: The Impact of Cost and Quality on Illegal Goods in the Supply Chain<br>Author: Maqbool Dada, Professor, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, 100 International Drive, Baltimore, MD, 21202, United States of America, dada@jhu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Arkadi Seidscher, Stefan Minner<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: A manufacturer of a branded product may deter competition from parallel imports, smuggled goods or counterfeits by investing in higher quality and lowering price. A four stage model of competition is developed to examine the impact of such competition. The analysis also has implications for legal means of competition; for example, from store brands in supermarkets or generic drugs in pharmacies.
