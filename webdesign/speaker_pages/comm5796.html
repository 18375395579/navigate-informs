Title: Online Product Reviews: Do They Benefit Retailers?<br>Author: Young Kwark, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, United States of America, youngk082@utdallas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Srinivasan Raghunathan, Jianqing Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the effect of online product reviews on an online retailer that carries two substitutable products produced by different manufacturers. Products differ in qualities and fits to consumer needs. We find quality-information homogenizes consumers' utility differences between products and increases upstream competition. Fit-information heterogenizes consumers' estimated fits to products and softens upstream competition. We show when retailer benefits from reviews and how preference differs.
