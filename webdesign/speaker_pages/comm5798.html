Title: Pricing Via Robust Optimization<br>Author: Aurelie Thiele, P.C. Rossin Asst Professor, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, aurelie.thiele@lehigh.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We present a robust optimization approach to the problem of pricing a capacitated product over a finite time horizon in the presence of demand uncertainty. We introduce a budget of resource consumption by the uncertainty, establish the existence of a reference price for the product and show that this new parameter plays a crucial role in understanding the impact of uncertainty on the optimal prices.
