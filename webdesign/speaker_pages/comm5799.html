Title: Price Trends in Dynamic Pricing Models<br>Author: Xiaowei Xu, Associate Professor, Rutgers Business School, 1 Washington Park, Room 958, Newark, NJ, 07102-3122, United States of America, xiaoweix@business.rutgers.edu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider a seller that has a limited amount of asset to liquidate in a finite time horizon. Demand signals are updated at preset time spots and the seller can adjust the product price accordingly. We offer the managerial insights of how probabilistic price trends are affected by time-varying and price-sensitive demand forms via exploring the recursive structure of the optimal pricing policy and the implied martingale decomposition.
