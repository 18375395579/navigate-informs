<br>Title: Integration of Operational and Financial Hedging</br><br>Author: Rong Li, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 50 Stamford Road, Singapore, 178899, Singapore, rongli@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis, Qing Ding</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study a multi-period hedging problem for a manufacturer who faces uncertain demand of commodity components. Traditional inventory management studies operational hedging only. In this research, we consider different types of financial hedging together with two operational hedging methods, which include a long-term flexible contract with a supplier and spot market participation. Optimal hedging policies are determined for a risk-averse manufacturer.</br>
