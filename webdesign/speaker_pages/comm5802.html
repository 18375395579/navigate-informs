Title: An MPEC Approach to Dynamic Pricing with Learning Under Competition<br>Author: Carine Simon, PhD Student, MIT Operations Research Center, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, casimon@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis, Soulaymane Kachani<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider an oligopoly for multiple perishable products where each firm dynamically updates its optimal prices (resp. allocations), while learning the demand (resp. price) function, using observed data. We  formulate the problem as a Mathematical Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC) and design a solutions algorithm. We prove that as the horizon increases, learning is achieved and discuss computational results.
