Title: Dynamic Pricing of Flight Passes<br>Author: Yuri Levin, Professor, Queen's School of Business, 143 Union str., Kingston, Canada, ylevin@business.queensu.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Mikhail Nediak, Huseyin Topaloglu<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many airlines have recently introduced a flight pass which targets customers in a frequent traveler segment. This product permits its holder to obtain a seat on a specified number of flights at a fixed price. Dynamic pricing of passes is contingent upon pricing of individual flights and how forward-looking customers choose between passes and individual bookings. We present a stochastic dynamic programming formulation for this problem and analyze the properties of the pricing policy.
