Title: Stochastic Models for Joint Pricing and Revenue Management<br>Author: Ayse Kocabiyikoglu, Assistant Professor, Bilkent University, Department of Business Administration, Bilkent, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, aysekoca@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Ioana Popescu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We extend the traditional revenue management paradigm to simultaneously optimize price and capacity allocation decisions, under a stochastic price dependent demand model. We provide conditions for the monotonicity of the capacity allocation policy, as well as the uniqueness of the optimal solution. We provide bounds on the optimal revenue and the results of numerical experiments, which demonstrate significant improvements in revenue from joint price-capacity allocation optimization.
