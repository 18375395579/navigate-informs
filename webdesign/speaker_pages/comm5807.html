Title: Pricing Restaurant Reservations<br>Author: Jaelynn Oh, University of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School, Philadelphia, United States of America, jaelynn@wharton.upenn.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Xuanming Su<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many restaurants offer reservations to delay sensitive customers and charge a fee for no-shows.  Strategic customers make a reservation only when the expected utility of doing so is greater than that of walking in without a reservation.  We study the restaurant’s pricing problem when serving both reservation holders and walk-in customers.  We characterize equilibrium prices and profits and discuss model implications.
