Title: Re-configurations of an Assembly Supply-chain and Subassemblies to Manage Supply-chain Disruptions<br>Author: Jeonghan Ko, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 175 Nebraska Hall, Industrial and Management Systems Eng., Lincoln, NE, 68588, United States of America, jko2@unl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hans Boeschen<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In the assembly supply chain, supplier or logistics disruptions usually lead to the delay in the assembly of products, often requiring supply chain re-design. This paper presents a mathematical model for the optimized re-configurations of subassemblies and re-assignment of these subassemblies to suppliers for the supply chain re-design.
