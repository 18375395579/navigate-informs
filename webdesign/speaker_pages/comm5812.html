Specifically, we show that ascending combinatorial auctions that do not use both bundle (non-linear) prices and personalized (non-anonymous) prices can not achieve social efficiency with general bidder valuations.  This casts doubt on the performance that can be achieved using the simpler auctions suggested in the literature, and justifies the added complexity in the auctions suggested by Parkes and Ungar (2000) and Ausubel and Milgrom (2002). Our impossibility results are very robust in several senses: they hold for any price update system, pattern of interaction with agents, or payment determination rule.  They do not depend on strategic aspects of the bidders, on computational limitations or on communication limitations.  Finally, we show that the loss of efficiency is severe and that only a diminishing fraction of the social welfare may be captured.</br>
