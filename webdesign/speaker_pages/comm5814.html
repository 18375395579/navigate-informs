Title: Pricing, Assortment and Inventory Decisions under Cross Selling<br>Author: Bacel Maddah, American University of Beirut, Bliss Street, Beirut, Lebanon, bm05@aub.edu.lb<br>Coauthor(s): Ahmed Ghoniem, Ameera Ibrahim<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We formulate a nonlinear integer program that jointly optimizes a retailer's decisions on assortment, pricing, and inventory for two complementary categories, primary (e.g. toys) and secondary (e.g. batteries). Decisions of the two categories are coupled by asymmetric cross-selling, where a stream of customers who purchase from the primary category would also buy from the secondary category.  We show that an exact linear reformulation of the problem exists, and draw managerial insights.
