<br>Title: Stocking More versus Less: The Roles of Demand Volatility and Profit Margin under Market Valuation</br><br>Author: Wenqiang Xiao, Assistant Professor, New York University, 44 W 4 Street, KMC 8-72, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, wxiao@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guoming Lai</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the effects of asymmetric information of demand volatility on the inventory decision of a public firm who cares about not only its operational profits but also its market value. We find that the firm, when it faces a high demand volatility (less efficient), overstocks if the profit margin is low and understocks if the profit margin is high, while the firm with a low demand volatility (more efficient) may either overstock or understock in both cases.</br>
