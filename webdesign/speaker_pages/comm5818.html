Title: Dynamic Pricing and Customers Reluctance Behavior<br>Author: Victor Araman, Assistant Professor, New York University, Henry Kaufman Management Center, 44 West 4th Street, New York, NY, 10012, United States, varaman@stern.nyu.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of pricing a finite capacity when customers exhibit reluctant behavior, i.e. an arriving customer spends random time observing the price before making a decision to buy or leave the system. We suggest a modeling framework, compute optimal policies and show that neglecting information about in-the-system potential sales may lead to suboptimal pricing decisions.
