Title: Managing Cost Salience and Project Output Quality: A Principal-agent Model<br>Author: Yaozhong Wu, Assistant Professor, NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117592, Singapore, bizwyz@nus.edu.sg<br>Coauthor(s): Vish Krishnan, Karthik Ramachandran<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We develop a principal-agent model in which agents decide how much effort to spend in each period of a two-period project. The agent has an immediacy bias such that the immediate cost is more salient, and future costs are hyperbolically discounted.  Unequal effort allocation results in low output quality and incurs a cost to the principal.  We study the incentive design problem in this context.  We also investigate how the principal should assemble the project team according to agent types.
