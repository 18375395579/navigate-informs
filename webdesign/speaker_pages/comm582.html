<br>Title: Managing Time-based Contracts with Delayed Payments</br><br>Author: Dharma Kwon, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Business Administration, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, hyok-jon.kwon.2008@anderson.ucla.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven Lippman, Kevin McCardle, Chris Tang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Some manufacturers impose a time-based contract on their suppliers    under which each supplier is paid only when all of the suppliers have completed their tasks.  We set up a model with one manufacturer and two suppliers and study the impact of the time-based contract on each supplier's effort level and on the manufacturer's profit.  When the suppliers' completion times are uncertain, the time-based contract is more profitable if and only if the manufacturer's project is sufficiently small.</br>
