Title: Revenue Management for Products with Unknown Quality and Observable Price and Sales History<br>Author: Laurens Debo, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, laurdebo@andrew.cmu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nicola Secomandi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: This paper studies pricing strategies of a monopolist when customers are strategic and infer the product quality from historical sales and price paths. The monopolist can sell a finite amount of inventory during a finite horizon. Its pricing policy controls the inventory as well as the customer learning. We derive the structure of the optimal pricing strategy and discuss the implications of strategic customer behavior.
