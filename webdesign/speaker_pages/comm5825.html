We study in this work how retail companies can benefit from available information about reluctant customers to adjust their prices accordingly. We assume a Poisson arrival of customers interested in some item who will spend a positive amount of time before deciding whether to buy or not. We compare such model to that of a generic one where customers are revealed only when they buy the item.</br>
