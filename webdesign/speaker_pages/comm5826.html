<br>Title: How Consumers Shop Online: Data, Models and Pricing Decisions</br><br>Author: Zachary Leung, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, zacleung@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis, Pavithra Harsha</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study an Internet retailer selling fashion items. We propose a demand model, where customers may not buy the item on their initial visit, but return over time and may purchase items on subsequent visits. We propose and analyze a markdown optimization pricing model with returning customers. Using clickstream data collected from an online fashion retailer, we estimate our demand model and quantify the benefit of applying our model.</br>
