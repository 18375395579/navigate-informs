Title: Cardinality Bundles for Spence-Mirrlees Reservation Prices<br>Author: Jianqing Wu, Purdue Univercity, 403 W.

In CB, the price depends on the number but not on the specific goods purchased; e.g., when songs are sold with CB, consumers may choose any songs up to the specified number. We develop polynomial time algorithms for various cost structures assuming that a customer purchases at most one bundle. Subsequently, we relax this assumption and study the impact of this assumption on seller profits.
