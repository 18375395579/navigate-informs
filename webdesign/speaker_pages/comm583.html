Risk-pooling is favored under uncertain demand and risk-diversification is favored under the risk of disruptions. In this talk we discuss how dynamic sourcing retains partial benefits from both policies. We formulate an integer programming model to study the impacts of this strategy on supply chain design decisions.</br>
