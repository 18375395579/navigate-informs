Title: Supply Base Design: The Number and Capacity of Suppliers<br>Author: Cuihong Li, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT, United States of America, Cuihong.Li@business.uconn.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Building redundancy in the supply base is important to mitigate supply chain risks. Acquiring more suppliers reduces the procurement cost risk, while investing in more total capacity counters the demand risk. The number and capacity of suppliers also influence supplier competition, driving suppliers' choice of cost-reduction efforts. We analyze the number and capacity of suppliers in supply base design, considering supplier cost uncertainty, supplier competition, and demand uncertainty.
