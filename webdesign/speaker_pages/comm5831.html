Title: Closed-loop Supply Chain Management<br>Author: Gilvan Gil Souza, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, gsouza@rhsmith.umd.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Closed-loop supply chains have flows of products (post-purchase) back to manufacturers, for example, consumer returns, and leasing.  I define basic terms: differences with respect to forward chains, sources of returns, disposition options, strategic, tactical, and operational issues, and regulatory issues. I provide an overview of remanufacturing practices in select industries, and review the academic literature on closed-loop supply chains, focusing on business and management aspects.
