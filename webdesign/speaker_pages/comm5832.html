Title: Push, Pull, or Both?  A Behavioral Study of Inventory Risk on Supply Chain Performance<br>Author: Andrew Davis, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, adavis@cornell.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Elena Katok<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We experimentally investigate how the allocation of inventory risk affects supply chain performance. We first evaluate two wholesale price contracts that differ in which party holds the inventory and develop a behavioral model. We then apply this model to a third  contract and find that it qualitatively matches behavior.
