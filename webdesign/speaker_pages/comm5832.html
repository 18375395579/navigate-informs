A Behavioral Study of Inventory Risk on Supply Chain Performance</br><br>Author: Andrew Davis, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, adavis@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elena Katok</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We experimentally investigate how the allocation of inventory risk affects supply chain performance. We first evaluate two wholesale price contracts that differ in which party holds the inventory and develop a behavioral model. We then apply this model to a third  contract and find that it qualitatively matches behavior.</br>
