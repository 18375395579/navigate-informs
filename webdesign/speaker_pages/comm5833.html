<br>Title: Information Asymmetry and Advance Purchase Discounts in Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Krishnan Anand, Assistant Professor, Operations and Information Management, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, anandk@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karan Girotra</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Advance Purchase Discounts (APD) have been shown to be beneficial in acquiring early demand information from customers ((Tang et al (2004)) and in coordinating two-tier supply chains (Cachon (2001)). In this study, we investigate the administration and benefits of APDs in two-tier supply chains where the two tiers have asymmetric information. We study the effect of APD contracts on the profits of the individual agents in the supply chain, as well as on total supply chain profits and welfare.</br>
