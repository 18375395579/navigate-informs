Title: Joint Procurement and Production Decisions in Remanufacturing with Uncertainty in Quality and Demand<br>Author: Huafan Ma, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 3202 N. Maryland Ave, S333, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States, mahuafan@uwm.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Samar Mukhopadhyay<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We address the uncertainty issue due to the random yield and demand in a remanufacturing system where both used and new parts can serve as inputs in the production process to satisfy the demand. We determine the optimal procurement and production quantity for the firm. Three different cases are presented depending on the amount of information the firm has on the yield rate. We also investigate how the degree of availability of information about yield rate affects the firm’s decision making.
