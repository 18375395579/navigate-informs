We model cumulative demand as a Brownian motion with unknown drift. This drift is the mean demand per unit time, and the posterior distribution of the unknown drift is continuously Bayesianly-updated. The manufacturer's policy is a triple: the initial price, the reduced price, and the (stopping) time when the price is to be reduced. We find the optimal policy and its comparative statics.</br>
