Title: When to Adjust Price under Incomplete Information<br>Author: Dharma Kwon, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Business Administration, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, dharma.kwon@gmail.com<br>Coauthor(s): Steven Lippman, Chris Tang<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: When, if ever, should the manufacturer of a new product whose demand is at yet unknown reduce its price? We model cumulative demand as a Brownian motion with unknown drift. This drift is the mean demand per unit time, and the posterior distribution of the unknown drift is continuously Bayesianly-updated. The manufacturer's policy is a triple: the initial price, the reduced price, and the (stopping) time when the price is to be reduced. We find the optimal policy and its comparative statics.
