Title: Dynamic Pricing and Replenishment with Customer Upgrades<br>Author: Oben Ceryan, Drexel University, LeBow College of Business, 3141 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, oceryan@drexel.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ozge Sahin, Izak Duenyas<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study the impact of product upgrades on a firm’s pricing and replenishment policies.  We consider a multiple period, nested two-stage model where at each period, the firm first sets prices and replenishment levels, and then decides whether to upgrade any of the realized demand to a higher quality product.  We characterize the structure of the optimal upgrade policy as well as the optimal pricing and replenishment policies.
