We consider a multiple period, nested two-stage model where at each period, the firm first sets prices and replenishment levels, and then decides whether to upgrade any of the realized demand to a higher quality product.  We characterize the structure of the optimal upgrade policy as well as the optimal pricing and replenishment policies.</br>
