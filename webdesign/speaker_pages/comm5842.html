<br>Title: Allocating Objects in a Network of Caches: Centralized and Decentralized Analyses</br><br>Author: Karthik Kannan, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 403 West State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, kkarthik@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mohit Tawarmalani, Prabuddha De</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we analyze object allocation in a network of caches that share web content to exploit network externality benefits.  The analysis is presented for both centralized and decentralized scenarios, and is carried out using operations research and game-theoretic tools. The optimal allocation is found for each case, and cache incentives are aligned with the socially optimal welfare by devising appropriate pricing mechanisms.</br>
