We analyze the effect of competition on the promotional and ordering decisions in a two-stage supply chain using game theory to model the interactions between competing retailers and manufacturers. We focus on  “retailer incentive?and “customer rebate?promotions and find the equilibrium decisions under different demand models and market conditions.
