Title: Supply Chain Coordination with Risk-Averse Players: A Behavioral Analysis<br>Author: Julie Niederhoff, Washington University in St Louis, Olin School of Business, One Brookings Drive; Campus Box 1133, St Louis, MO, 63130, United States, julieniederhoff@wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study supply chain coordination under risk-aversion.  Players are measured for risk preferences and then act as profit-maximizing suppliers or retailers to determine which mechanisms are most effective.  We use the two-member newsvendor supply chain.  We use traditional theory of risk-neutral and risk-averse players as a benchmark to measure actual performance.
