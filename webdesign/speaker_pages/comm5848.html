This research compares the pricing and welfare effects of different pooled procurement structures for new vaccines. Analysis reveals that homogenous income pools are beneficial to low income countries, manufacturers, and welfare. However, when heterogeneous, pool composition affects the benefits of pooled procurement and could even disadvantage certain member countries.
