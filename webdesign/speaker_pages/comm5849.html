Title: Should Purchasing Activities be Outsourced Along with Production?<br>Author: Rachel Zhang, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, United States, rzhang@ust.hk<br>Coauthor(s): Kaijie Zhu, Xi Yang<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: When outsourcing its production to a contract manufacturer, a brand name company may also let the manufacturer take on the procurement of materials to save overhead costs and to focus on its core competency. But outsourcing the purchasing function may induce the manufacturer to seek inexpensive but low-quality suppliers, which may in turn damage the market share of the brand name company. We use a game-theoretic approach to evaluate the option of outsourcing purchasing activities.
