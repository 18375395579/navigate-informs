Title: First Mover (Dis)advantage with Private Information and Dynamic Supply Condition<br>Author: Sridhar Seshadri, Professor, University of Texas, Professor, IROM Dept., CBA 6.446, Mail code B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, Sridhar.Seshadri@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Milind Sohoni, Aditya Jain, Jiri Chod<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider 2 competing retailers ordering sequentially, based on private forecasts. Most papers on first mover advantage ignore changes in supply conditions resulting from information dissemination due to decisions of first mover. Our model incorporates a common supplier who sets the wholesale prices. We characterize conditions that result in first mover advantage under various information disclosure scenarios, and examine the supplier’s incentive to disseminate the first mover’s information.
