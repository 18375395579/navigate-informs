Title: Explicit Optimal Base-Stock Levels with Stochastic Demand and Purchasing Cost<br>Author: Victor Martinez de Albeniz, Assistant Professor, IESE Business School, Av.

We consider a model where the purchase price is assumed to follow (i) a geometric Brownian motion or (ii) a mean-reverting process. Using the single-unit decomposition approach, we present a simple procedure to compute in closed-form the optimal base-stock levels, which depend on the current price, its expected evolution and its volatility.
