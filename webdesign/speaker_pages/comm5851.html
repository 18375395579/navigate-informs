Title: Optimal Production and Admission Policies in Make-To-Stock/Make-To-Order Manufacturing Systems<br>Author: Tieming Liu, Assistant Professor, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States, tieming.liu@okstate.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Seyed Iravani, David Simchi-Levi<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study production and admission controls in manufacturing systems that produce two types of products. The first type consists of identical items that are produced to stock, while the second are products with varying features that are produced to order. We show a modified basestock policy is optimal with exponential production times and Poisson arrival demands for each product. We extend the results to problems with multiple make-to-order products and with cancelable make-to-stock backorders.
