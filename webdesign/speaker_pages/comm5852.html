We consider a lot-sizing problem where production, inventory, transportation, and pricing decisions are integrated to maximize profits. We assume general concave revenue functions and fixed charge production cost functions. We develop polynomial-time solution approaches to solve these problems under a number of different inventory holding and transportation cost structures.</br>
