Title: Lot-Sizing Problems Integrating Production, Transportation, Inventory, and Pricing Decisions<br>Author: Mehmet Onal, PhD Student, University of Florida, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, monal@ufl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): H. Edwin Romeijn<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Through pricing decisions the demand levels a firm should satisfy can be controlled and higher profits can be obtained. We consider a lot-sizing problem where production, inventory, transportation, and pricing decisions are integrated to maximize profits. We assume general concave revenue functions and fixed charge production cost functions. We develop polynomial-time solution approaches to solve these problems under a number of different inventory holding and transportation cost structures.
