The downside risk-averse supplier is the Stackelberg leader in the decentralized chain and designs the “optimal?contract parameters.  We compare the performance of this decentralized contract with channel performance under two centralized coordinating contracts: coordinating contracts with and without consideration of agent risk perspectives.</br>
