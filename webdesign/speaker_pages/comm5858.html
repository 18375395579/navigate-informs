Title: Successive Demand Updating and Inventory Ordering after Observations of Sales and Lost Sales<br>Author: Annabelle Feng, Asssitant Professor, McCombs School of Business, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, annabelle.feng@mccombs.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Alain Bensoussan, Metin Cakanyildirim, Suresh Sethi<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Customer demands are often partially observed due to the lack of tracking lost sales.  A two-stage multi-period inventory model is studied to understand the policy impact of the lost sales observation. We demonstrate two different roles of inventory here: satisfying the demand and deducing the demand information. To explain the counterintuitive policy behaviors, we show that additional information of the demand may lead to an increased cost evaluation when the demand observation is censored.
