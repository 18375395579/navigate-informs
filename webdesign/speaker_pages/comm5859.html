Title: Inducing Reliable Supply: Simple Versus Simplistic Contracts<br>Author: Woonam Hwang, PhD Candidate, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, whwang.phd2009@london.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nitin Bakshi, Victor DeMiguel<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Disruption risk in supply can be mitigated through the supplier's effort, but it is often not contractible in a decentralized supply chain. We show that a sufficiently complex contract can coordinate the supply chain. However, complex contracts are often not practicable. Therefore, we investigate the trade-off between simplicity and efficiency of contracts. We find that efficiency hinges critically on the type of supply risk and the relative bargaining power of the parties involved.
