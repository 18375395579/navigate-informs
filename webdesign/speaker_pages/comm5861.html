Title: Selling New Products to Strategic Customers with Learning Externality<br>Author: Yufei Huang, PhD Student, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, yufei.huang.10@ucl.ac.uk<br>Coauthor(s): Bilal Gokpinar, Onesun Yoo<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a seller’s optimal pricing strategy and capacity decision when selling a new/innovative product to risk-averse customers who are uncertain about their valuations. Customers are strategic, who may deliberately delay their purchase for a lower price or more information from other customers to reduce their valuation uncertainty. We then analyse the effect of learning externality on the seller’s pricing strategy and capacity decision.
