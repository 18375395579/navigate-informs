Title: Supply/demand Synchronization through Demand Shaping and Customer Analytics<br>Author: Roger Lederman, Postdoctoral Research Scientist, IBM, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, rdlederm@us.ibm.com<br>Coauthor(s): Marek Petrik<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Demand shaping is the ability to sense demand patterns, evaluate, and execute actions to steer demand to better integrate the supply chain horizontally. We present a suite of mathematical models that enable demand shaping through dynamic management of product availability, price discounts, and sales levers across a portfolio of partially substitutable products. We discuss sensing, computation of optimal shaping actions, and insights from a real-life server computer manufacturing environment.
