Mudd Building Room 334, New York, NY, United States, kachani@ieor.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kyrylo Shmatov</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We address the problem of simultaneous determination of pricing and inventory decisions for multiple firms, where each firm offers a line of complementary and substitute products with multiple attributes, under stochastic demand. We consider several models of consumer demand and propose an iterative relaxation algorithm that computes Nash equilibrium solutions.  We study a large-scale real-life problem and compare cooperative and competitive situations.</br>
