We characterize the situation as a game-theoretic model consisting of sequential decisions made by the OEM and the contract manufacturer (CM) in two scenarios - the CM offering the contract to the OEM, and vice-versa. We contrast the results for the two scenarios in the absence and presence of information asymmetry about cost structure.
