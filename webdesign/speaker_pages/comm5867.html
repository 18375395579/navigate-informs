Title: Optimal Spot Market Inventory Strategies  in the Presence of Cost and Price Risk<br>Author: Ming Yuen, UC Berkeley, IEOR, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, ming@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Phil Kaminsky, Xin Guo, Pascal Tomecek<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a firm facing random demand at the end of a period. At any time, the firm can either increase or decrease inventory by buying or selling on a spot market where price fluctuates randomly over time. We show that this is equivalent to a two-dimensional singular control problem, and use this insight combined with recent control-theoretic results to characterize the optimal policy. Finally, we explore the managerial implications of both our closed-form solutions and computational study.
