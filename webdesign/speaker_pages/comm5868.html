Title: Competitive Newsboy Problem with Non-identical Retailers and Asymmetric Information<br>Author: Evren Korpeoglu, Bilkent University, Industrial Engineering Dept., Ankara, 06800, Turkey, evrenko@bilkent.edu.tr<br>Coauthor(s): Alper Sen, Kemal Guler<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider the competitive newsboy problem with two non-identical firms under asymmetric cost information. The market demand is initially allocated to two firms and the excess demand is re-allocated to the firm with remaining inventory. We examine the role of competition and private information on inventory decisions and the total inventory. When the costs of two firms have non-overlapping support, we show that the asymmetric and full information cases lead to the same total inventory.
