<br>Title: Vertical Integration under Competition: Forward, Backward, or No Integration?</br><br>Author: Yen-Ting Lin, Assistant Professor, University of San Diego, Olin Hall 334, San Diego, CA, 92110, United States of America, linyt@sandiego.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jayashankar M. Swaminathan, Ali Parlakturk</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider two competing supply chains, each consisting of a supplier, a manufacturer and a retailer. The supplier controls the product quality, and the retailer sets the retail price. Each manufacturer can choose to (1) forward integrate, (2) backward integrate, or (3) staying disintegrated. We analyze the resulting equilibrium supply chain structure, and examine the effects of competition, demand perishability, and cost of improving quality on manufacturers?choice.</br>
