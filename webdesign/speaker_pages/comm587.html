Firms often use a Tailored Base-Surge(TBS) Policy (Allon and Van Mieghem 2010) in such cases: Procure a constant quantity from the regular supplier in every period and choose the emergency procurement quantity dynamically.  We present a set of analytical results to understand when these policies are most effective.
