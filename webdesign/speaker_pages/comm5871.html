Title: A Cover-based Competitive Location Model<br>Author: Tammy Drezner, California State University, Fullerton, Department of ISDS, Fullerton, CA, 92834, United States of America, tdrezner@fullerton.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Pawel Kalczynski, Zvi Drezner<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We propose a new approach to estimating market share captured by competing facilities. Each competing facility has a 'sphere of influence' determined by its attractiveness level. More attractive facilities have a larger radius of the sphere of influence. The buying power of a customer in the sphere of influence of several facilities is equally divided among the competing facilities. The buying power of a customer in the sphere of influence of no facility is lost.
