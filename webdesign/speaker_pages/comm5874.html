Title: On the Threshold Purchasing Behavior of Customers Facing Dynamically Priced Perishable Products<br>Author: Yong-Pin Zhou, University of Washington, Business School, Seattle, WA, United States, yongpin@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ming Fan, Minho Cho<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Dynamic pricing is a standard practice that firms use for revenue management. As price fluctuates with the changes in inventory and time, a strategic customer may postpone a purchase in anticipation of lower prices in the future. We analyze a threshold purchasing policy for the strategic customer, and use numerical studies to study its impact on both the strategic customer’s utility and the firm’s revenue. We find that in most cases the policy can benefit both.
