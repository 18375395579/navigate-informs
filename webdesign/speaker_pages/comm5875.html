<br>Title: The Power of Uniform Subsidies to Incentivize Demand ?Optimal and Near-optimal Results</br><br>Author: Gonzalo Romero, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 100 Main Street, E62-461, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, gromeroy@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi, Georgia Perakis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a subsidy allocation problem with endogenous market response under a budget constraint. The central planner allocates subsidies to heterogeneous producers to maximize the consumption of a commodity. We identify marginal cost functions such that uniform subsidies are optimal, even under demand uncertainty. This is precisely the policy usually implemented in practice. Moreover, we show that uniform subsidies have a guaranteed performance in important cases where they are not optimal.</br>
