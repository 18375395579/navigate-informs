The facility operates in a make-to-order mode with a limited buffer area. We formulate the problem as an MDP to maximize the expected total discounted profit and show various characteristics of an optimal policy. We demonstrate the value of price and lead time quotation flexibility through numerical analysis and provide results on a simple heuristic to determine effective quotes.</br>
