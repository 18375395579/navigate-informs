<br>Title: How Do Customers Respond to Service Quality Competition?</br><br>Author: Ryan Buell, Assistant Professor, Harvard Business School, Morgan Hall T37, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, rbuell@hbs.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dennis Campbell, Frances Frei</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: When does increased service quality competition lead to customer defection, and which customers are most likely to defect? We find that customers defect at a higher rate from the incumbent following increased service quality (price) competition when the incumbent offers high (low) quality service relative to existing competitors in a local market. We further show that it is the high quality incumbent's most profitable customers who are the most attracted by superior quality entrants.</br>
