Graves<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We describe, model, and optimize the reverse logistics that support the warranty system used by a Fortune 100 company that sells consumer electronics. Since this company uses refurbished devices to satisfy warranty claims, their reverse logistics operation is also a closed-loop supply chain.  Within this setting, our main contributions are: (i) Policies for managing inventory of refurbished devices in this system;  (ii) An algorithm for assigning refurbished items in inventory to customers.
