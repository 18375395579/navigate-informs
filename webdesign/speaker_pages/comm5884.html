<br>Title: Modeling Collaboration among Rail Carriers in Transporting Goods Arriving on Spot Markets</br><br>Author: Elise Miller-Hooks, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Department of Civil & Environmental Engin., 1173 Glenn Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, elisemh@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): April Kuo</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Concepts of collaborative decision-making are incorporated within a combinatorial auction-based framework to support competing rail carriers operating within an alliance in co-transporting one-off loads arriving on spot markets. A train space leasing problem is also addressed. The proposed techniques aid in forming profitable trains that might otherwise have been underutilized and permit carriers to compete with truck transport on the spot market.</br>
