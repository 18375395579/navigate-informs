Title: Designing Consumer Subsidies with Industry Response for Green Technology Adoption<br>Author: Maxime Cohen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, maxcohen@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ruben Lobel, Georgia Perakis<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study the problem of designing consumer subsidies for adopting green technologies. We introduce a model where the government sets subsidies to achieve an adoption target level while minimizing its expenditures whereas industry decides production and price to optimize its profit. We derive insights on the impact of demand uncertainty by comparing the optimal policies for stochastic demand to an average case approximation. Finally, we analyze the supply-chain efficiency.
