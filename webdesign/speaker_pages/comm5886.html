<br>Title: Optimizing the Timing of New Product Introductions in the Presence of Strategic Customers</br><br>Author: Jigar Patel, NYU-Stern, 44 West 4th Street, KMC 8-152, New York, 10012, United States of America, jigar@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ilan Lobel, Jiawei Zhang, Gustavo Vulcano</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of a technology firm deciding the optimal timing of its product introductions. Consumers are strategic and weigh the value of purchasing improved products in light of future technological improvements. We show that the optimal policy consists of alternating cycles, with long introduction intervals following short ones. We also show how to implement such policies when the firm does not have the power to commit to future launch dates.</br>
