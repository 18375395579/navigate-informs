<br>Title: Let the Market Decide the Price: The (Non-)Use of Buy-now Price in Online Auctions as a Value Signal</br><br>Author: Kursad Asdemir, University of Alberta, School of Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada, kursad.asdemir@ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chun Qiu, Peter Popkowski-Leszcyc</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A buy-now price is a feature frequently used by sellers in online auctions. We study buy-now price as a value signal that influences the bidders?beliefs.  A rational expectations equilibrium in which high and low buy-now prices are not used is derived. A high buy-now price is detrimental to the seller; because it raises a bidder’s expectation of the value; and reduces the credibility of the seller’s signal. We provide experiments that support our results.</br>
