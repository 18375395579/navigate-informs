<br>Title: Capacitated Procurement Planning with Price-sensitive Demand and General Concave Revenue Functions</br><br>Author: Joseph Geunes, Associate Professor, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, geunes@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yasemin Merzifonluoglu, Edwin Romeijn</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We provide solution methods for discrete-time, finite-horizon procurement planning problems with economies of scale in procurement, price-sensitive demand, and time-invariant capacities. We assume general concave revenue functions in each period, and maximize total net revenue.  We consider the case where prices vary dynamically, as well as when a constant price is required.  Under mild conditions on revenue functions, we provide polynomial-time solution methods for this problem class.</br>
