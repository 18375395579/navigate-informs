Title: Sell or Lease? Stories on Electric Cars and Textbooks<br>Author: Yangfang Zhou, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, 50 Stamford Rd, Singapore, 178899, Singapore, helenzhou@smu.edu.sg<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We investigate the problem of whether to sell or lease products by considering the strategic customer behavior of waiting. Two examples of such products are electric vehicles and textbooks. We examine how this decision (sell or lease) is affected by the customer impatience and the rate of product cost reduction. We find that under certain conditions, it is even more valuable for car manufacturers to lease electric cars, and for the publishers to rent books.
