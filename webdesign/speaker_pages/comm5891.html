Title: Make or Buy: Impact of Information on Optimal Production/Outsourcing Policies with Limited Capacity<br>Author: Liwen Chen, PhD Student, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station B6500, IROM Department, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, liwen.chen@mail.utexas.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Genaro Gutierrez<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study a production/outsourcing problem with limited capacity and outsourcing option using a formal Bayesian framework. We show find the optimal production/outsourcing policy. We provide monotonicity results of the critical points w.r.t. the production capacity and the information acquiring time. We find that the knowledge that we are going to get demand information later will change our operational decisions. We also explore mismatch cost, outsourcing option value.
