Title: Group-Buying under Strategic Consumers<br>Author: Navaporn Surasvadi, New York University, 44 West Fourth St, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, nsurasva@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Christopher Tang, Gustavo Vulcano<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We study a revenue management problem in which a retailer operates a group-buy  mechanism under strategic customers. At the beginning of the selling season, the retailer  announces a regular price and a lower group buy coupon price.  The low price becomes available as soon as a threshold number of consumers subscribe to the coupon. We analyze the subgame played among consumers and show that they follow a threshold-type purchasing rule in equilibrium. Then, through a numerical study, we calculate the retailer’s expected  revenues under our proposed mechanism and compare it with other benchmarks.
