At the beginning of the selling season, the retailer  announces a regular price and a lower group buy coupon price.  The low price becomes available as soon as a threshold number of consumers subscribe to the coupon. We analyze the subgame played among consumers and show that they follow a threshold-type purchasing rule in equilibrium. Then, through a numerical study, we calculate the retailer’s expected  revenues under our proposed mechanism and compare it with other benchmarks.</br>
