<br>Title: Coordination of the Influenza Vaccine Supply Chain in the Presence of Costly Effort</br><br>Author: Xinghao Yan, Ivey Business School, Western University, London, ON, Canada, xyan@ivey.uwo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Greg Zaric</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we develop a model of the influenza vaccination supply chain consisting of a health authority, a vaccine manufacturer, and the general population. We show that in the decentralized case the optimal order quantity is never less than the vaccination demand. Unlike previous research, the optimal fraction vaccinated may be lower than the level that attains herd immunity. We find coordinating contracts under different assumptions about what pieces of information are verifiable.</br>
