Title: Financing Consumer Purchases - Optimal Credit Strategies for a Monopolistic Retailer<br>Author: Robert Grueter, EBS University, Konrad-Adenauer-Ring 15, Wiesbaden, 65187, Germany, robert.grueter@ebs.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Sebastian Heese<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Consumer loans offered directly by retailers are an increasingly important marketing instrument. These loans enable credit-constrained customers to purchase needed goods. On the other hand, longer credit terms imply increased default risk for the retailer. We study a monopolistic retailer’s optimal customer financing decisions for different economic and informational settings.
