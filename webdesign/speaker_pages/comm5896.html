Title: On Supply Risk and Asymmetric Information<br>Author: Zhibin Yang, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, zhibiny@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Goker Aydin, Volodymyr Babich, Damian Beil<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a manufacturer using dual-sourcing and backup-production (manufacturer’s or supplier’s) options to manage supply risk under asymmetric information about supplier reliability.  These options may be more or less valuable for the manufacturer under asymmetric information. Asymmetric information discourages the manufacturer from using dual-sourcing and supplier backup production options with the less reliable supplier type. Higher reliability may not be a substitute for information.
