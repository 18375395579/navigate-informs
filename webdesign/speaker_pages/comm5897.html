Title: Competitive Equilibrium under Restrictions on Hazardous Substances<br>Author: Erica Plambeck, Professor, Stanford Graduate School of Business, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, plambeck_erica@gsb.stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Terry Taylor<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: New laws restrict sale of electronics containing hazardous substances. Manufacturers may test competitors' products and thus prevent sale of noncompliant products. We characterize the equilibrium in the manufacturers?investments to eliminate toxics, testing of competitors?products, and sales quantities. The new laws may cause entry by noncompliant, nonbranded manufacturers.
