Manufacturers may test competitors' products and thus prevent sale of noncompliant products. We characterize the equilibrium in the manufacturers?investments to eliminate toxics, testing of competitors?products, and sales quantities. The new laws may cause entry by noncompliant, nonbranded manufacturers.</br>
