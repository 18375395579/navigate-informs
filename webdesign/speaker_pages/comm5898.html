Given the day-ahead and spot  markets?clearing rules set by a system operator and the fact that LSEs?and GenCo’s maximize their risk-adjusted profits, we derive the forward and spot market equilibrium prices which incorporate the transmission congestion information. Empirical analysis is conducted to test our model.</br>
