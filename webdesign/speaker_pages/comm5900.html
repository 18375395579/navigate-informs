Bookbinder</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider joint decisions on pricing and shipment-release policies for a transportation provider whose customers are sensitive to both price and delivery-time guarantee.  For differential and for uniform pricing schemes, the profit rate is maximized through the choice of length of consolidation period.  We also report on optimality structures when there are freight discounts.</br>
