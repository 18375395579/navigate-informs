Title: Product Quality Selection: Contractual Agreements in a One Manufacturer Multiple Supplier Environment<br>Author: Mehmet Sekip Altug, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, 3022 Broadway, Uris Hall 4J, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, msa2104@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We consider a model with one manufacturer who makes an end product using multiple components, each provided by a different supplier. Suppliers sell components at a wholesale price that depends on component quality. The quality of the end product is determined by the quality of the individual components. The manufacurer seeks to maximize profits by trading off quality and component cost. This creates competition among the suppliers. We analyze possible contractual agreements in the channel.
