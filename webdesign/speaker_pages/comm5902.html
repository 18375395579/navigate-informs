Title: Contracting for Supply Flexibility Under Asymmetric Information<br>Author: Tianjun Feng, University of California-Irvine, The Paul Merage School of Business, Irvine, CA, 92697, United States, fengt@uci.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Fuqiang Zhang<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: This paper studies a buyer's procurement problem when there are either one or multiple potential suppliers with private cost information. The market demand is uncertain and the supplier needs to make capacity decisions before demand is realized. We derive the optimal procurement mechanism for the buyer and also identify simple mechanisms that perform well.
