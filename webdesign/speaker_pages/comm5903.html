Our auction design economizes information needed from bidders, uses a simple and intuitive price adjustment procedure, and accommodates explicit reserve prices. Despite these features, it stops in a finite time, has a sincere bidding ex-post Nash equilibrium, and the ending prices and revenue depend only on reserve prices.</br>
