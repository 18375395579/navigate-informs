<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing with Strategic Customers under Price Adjustment Policy</br><br>Author: Boxiao (Beryl) Chen, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, boxchen@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiuli Chao, Hyun-Soo Ahn</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing strategy of a monopolist serving heterogeneous forward-looking customers. The firm offers a price adjustment policy, which guarantees current buyers a full refund of the difference if they find a lower future price within a certain time window. We establish the existence of a subgame perfect equilibrium pricing policy and show that the firm sets different equilibrium pricing patterns in different regions of system parameters.</br>
