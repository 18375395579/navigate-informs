Title: Retailing with Opaque Products<br>Author: Adam Elmachtoub, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, ane@mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Yehua Wei<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: An opaque product is where the consumer only learns of the entire product's characteristics after the purchase is complete. Opaque products have been used in the travel industry, where consumers can buy airline tickets without knowing which airline or flight they will receive. Unlike airlines, we propose that online retailers sell opaque products directly alongside traditional products. Our results show that retailing with opaque products is beneficial from both revenue and cost perspectives.
