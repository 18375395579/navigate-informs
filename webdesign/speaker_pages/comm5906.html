Opaque products have been used in the travel industry, where consumers can buy airline tickets without knowing which airline or flight they will receive. Unlike airlines, we propose that online retailers sell opaque products directly alongside traditional products. Our results show that retailing with opaque products is beneficial from both revenue and cost perspectives.</br>
