Title: Optimal Dynamic Buy-it-now Pricing for Sponsored Search Advertising<br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, University of California-Berkeley, Department of Industrial Engineering, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, chen@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Asian search engines have pervasively adopted the buy-it-now options for selling the positions to advertisers. These buy-it-now options allow the advertisers to prematurely end an auction to obtain the position and have swamped the underlying ascending auctions. We demonstrate the quality uncertainty due to the discrepancy between nominal and actual positions, and characterize the optimal dynamic buy-it-now pricing in this sponsored search business model.
