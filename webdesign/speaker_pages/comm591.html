Customers are heterogeneous in quality valuations and arrive according to a Poisson process. We model product-focused and product-flexible production processes via queuing systems. We derive the optimal capacity, product variety, and quality levels, the resulting market coverage, segmentation, and effects on congestion levels, and provide managerial insights.</br>
