Title: Product Variety and Congested Production Systems: Capacity Investments and Vertical Differentiation<br>Author: Sergio Chayet, Assistant Professor, Olin School of Business, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO, 63141, United States, chayet@wustl.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis, Dennis Yu<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We investigate product line design and capacity investment decisions for vertically differentiated products on design quality levels. Customers are heterogeneous in quality valuations and arrive according to a Poisson process. We model product-focused and product-flexible production processes via queuing systems. We derive the optimal capacity, product variety, and quality levels, the resulting market coverage, segmentation, and effects on congestion levels, and provide managerial insights.
