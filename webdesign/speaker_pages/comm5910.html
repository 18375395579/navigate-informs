Title: Optimal Marketing over Social Networks<br>Author: Vahab Mirrokni, Google Research, New York, NY, United States of America, mirrokni@theory.csail.mit.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Jason Hartline, Mukund Sundararajan<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We discuss the use of social networks in viral marketing. While influence maximization has been studied in this context, we study revenue maximization. In our model, a buyer's decision to buy an item is influenced by the price of the item and the set of buyers that own the item. To solve this problem, we identify influence-and-exploit strategies. We first argue why such strategies are reasonable and then show how to use submdoualr maximization to implement these strategies.
