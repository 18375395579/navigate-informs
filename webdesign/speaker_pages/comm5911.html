The retailer decides how many bundles to form and what prices to charge for the bundle so that expected profits over season are maximized. Product demands follow a Poisson Process and customer reservation prices are assumed to have a joint distribution. We study the impact of reservation prices, inventory levels, arrival rates and bundle formation costs.</br>
