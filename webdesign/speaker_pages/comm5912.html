Demand processes evolve with time requiring forecast updating by the retailer. Our analysis shows the impact of product variety and capital budgeting on the bullwhip effect along with methods to mitigate this effect. The paper is motivated by a production planning problem encountered at a bicycle manufacturer selling through multiple independent small-scale retailers.</br>
