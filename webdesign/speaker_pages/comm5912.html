Title: The Effect of Capital Budgeting on a Multi-Product Stocking Problem<br>Author: Avi Giloni, Associate Professor, Sy Syms School of Business, Yeshiva University, 500 West 185th Street, New York, NY, 10033, United States, agiloni@ymail.yu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Vishal Gaur, Ganesh Janakiraman<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We model the inventory decisions of a retailer serving demand for several products, and facing a capital budget constraint. Demand processes evolve with time requiring forecast updating by the retailer. Our analysis shows the impact of product variety and capital budgeting on the bullwhip effect along with methods to mitigate this effect. The paper is motivated by a production planning problem encountered at a bicycle manufacturer selling through multiple independent small-scale retailers.
