Title: Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Control: Centralized and Decentralized Analysis of Dual-Channel Supply<br>Author: Tao Yao, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University, 310 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, tyy1@engr.psu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Terry Friesz, Yongma Moon<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We deal with manufacturer¡¯s redesign of traditional channel structures by engaging in direct internet sales. Consumer demand for the two channels depends on the prices and customer acceptance of these channels. For a vertical integration case, a continuous time optimal control problem is modeled and necessary (sufficient) conditions are provided. For a competition situation, a differential variational inequality formulation is applied to solve it as a Cournot-Nash-Bertrand game.
