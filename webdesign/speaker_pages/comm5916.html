Title: Assortment Selection and Pricing for Configurable Products<br>Author: Betzabe Rodriguez, PhD Student, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, betzabe@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Goker Aydin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Consider a retailer selling a configurable product, whose price depends on what option the customer chooses for each feature. We analyze the retailer’s option assortment and pricing problem. We utilize a two-stage consumer choice model: The customer first decides whether or not to visit the retailer, followed by the actual purchase decision.  We show that options with higher demand uncertainty will be dropped from the assortment and tighter service level goals result in narrower assortments.
