Title: Investing in Product Reusability: The Effect of Remanufacturing Cost and Demand Uncertainty<br>Author: Andreas Robotis, Post-Doctoral Fellow, McGill University, Canada, andreas.robotis@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Tamer Boyaci, Vedat Verter<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Recent closed loop supply chain management literature positions uncertainty as one of the most important challenges for firms intending to invest in closed-loop systems. We focus on two types of uncertainty and their impact upon these investments: remanufacturing cost and demand uncertainty.  We adopt a 2-period setting, and we find that remanufacturing cost uncertainty has a positive effect, while the effect of demand uncertainty is negative.
