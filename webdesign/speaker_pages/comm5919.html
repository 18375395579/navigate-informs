Title: Using Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines to Predict Bids for Highway Construction Projects<br>Author: Seth Guikema, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, 3136 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843-3136, United States of America, sguikema@civil.tamu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Roshan Pawar<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Estimating bid prices for a project is important for both bidders and state agencies. Predictions of competitor bids can help bidders estimate their chances of winning the bid. Bid predictions can help state agencies formulate better price estimates early in the project life-cycle. We will use data from actual highway projects to demonstrate that MARS models can yield fairly accurate bid prices based on past bids and help agencies and bidders better understand the major drivers of bid prices.
