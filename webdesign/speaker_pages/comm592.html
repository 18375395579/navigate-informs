<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing in e-Services under Demand Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Cathy Xia, Associate Professor, The Ohio State University, Dept. of Industrial & System Engineering, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, cathyhxia@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Parijat Dube</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: High volatility of the e-Services market, due to increasing competition, low life cycle of products, and easy availability of information, makes the demand for service offerings quite uncertain. Revenue management in such markets calls for real-time techniques to learn the demand and its dependence on both the price and the offered service level. We propose a novel learning approach that is guaranteed to converge to the optimal offering and meanwhile near Bayesian optimal.</br>
