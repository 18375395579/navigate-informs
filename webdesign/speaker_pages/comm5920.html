We present a detailed analysis of a large rental car company that  gave us unprecedented access to its operations.  We show that it can significantly increase profits by keeping its cars twice  as long as it currently does and discounting  the prices of older cars to induce its customers to rent them.  These predictions were confirmed in a field experiment run by the company.</br>
