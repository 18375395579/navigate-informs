Title: Risk-Averse Newsvendor Networks: Resource Flexibility, Sharing, and Hedging<br>Author: Jan Van Mieghem, Harold L. Stuart Distinguished Professor of Managerial Economics, Professor of Operations Management, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, MEDS Department, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-2009, United States, VanMieghem@kellogg.northwestern.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We discuss how differences in risk exposure and risk attitude affect optimal resource levels in a multi-product network.  While the focus is on theory, results may apply to capacity controls on recent flexible revenue management products.  Ideas are illustrated by two networks that serve two markets through two dedicated or one flexible resource but differ in the position of the flexible resource. Revenue maximization suggests to increase (decrease) parallel (serial) flexibility.
