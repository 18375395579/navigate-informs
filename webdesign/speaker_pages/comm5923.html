Wine is a highly branded product produced in a few countries and shipped thousands of miles to consumers. Furthermore, there is a limited supply and at least one large consumer, the US, legally restricts distribution through a three-tier system. We will describe some OR challenges in this supply chain, from the winery to the importer, the distributor, and the retailer.</br>
