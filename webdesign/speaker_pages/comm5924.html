The literature in this field proposes different auction designs using linear or non-linear personalized prices. In this talk, we will describe the results of laboratory experiments testing different ICA designs, most notably ALPS, the Combinatorial Clock auction, iBundle, and the VCG auction based on different valuation models.</br>
