Title: Iterative Combinatorial Auction Designs in the Lab<br>Author: Martin Bichler, TU Munchen, martin.bichler@in.tum.de<br>Coauthor(s): Kemal Guler<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs) are economic mechanisms where bidders submit bundle bids in a sequence and an auctioneer computes allocations and ask prices in each auction round. The literature in this field proposes different auction designs using linear or non-linear personalized prices. In this talk, we will describe the results of laboratory experiments testing different ICA designs, most notably ALPS, the Combinatorial Clock auction, iBundle, and the VCG auction based on different valuation models.
