Mudd Building Room 334, New York, NY, United States, kachani@ieor.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Attakrit Asvanunt<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We consider a strategic customer who wishes to purchase a plane ticket when the airline prices according to the model of Gallego and van Ryzin (Management Science, 1994), or the airline uses the EMSR method for seat allocation. We establish that the optimal purchasing policy is a threshold price policy for both pricing rules, and a threshold time policy for the first pricing rule. We perform numerical analyses to study the effectiveness of the policy under forecasting errors and mispricing.
