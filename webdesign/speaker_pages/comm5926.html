We characterize (S-adapted open-loop and Markov perfect) equilibrium investments, hydropower scheduling, and thermal outputs. We compare duopoly equilibrium outcomes  with the socially efficient outcomes. In particular, the degree of overinvestment in thermal-capacity and the  efficiency of water-use are analyzed.</br>
