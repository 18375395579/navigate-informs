Title: Dynamic Competition in Electricity Markets: Hydropower and Thermal Generation<br>Author: Talat Genc, University of Guelph, Dept. of Economics, Guelph, ON, N1G2W1, Canada, tgenc@uoguelph.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Henry Thille<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: We study dynamic duopolistic competition between hydropower and thermal generation plants under demand uncertainty. We characterize (S-adapted open-loop and Markov perfect) equilibrium investments, hydropower scheduling, and thermal outputs. We compare duopoly equilibrium outcomes  with the socially efficient outcomes. In particular, the degree of overinvestment in thermal-capacity and the  efficiency of water-use are analyzed.
