Title: Contracting with Risk-averse Newsvendor<br>Author: Wenjie Tang, INSEAD, Blvd. de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, wenjie.tang@insead.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Nils Rudi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We find that while risk aversion with price only contracts always results in a smaller equilibrium quantity, the newsvendors expected profit might actually be larger. Furthermore, we find that a two-part tariff under risk aversion can coordinate the supply chain and split the total profit in any proportion.
