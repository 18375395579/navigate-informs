<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing and Mail-in-Rebate Design with Limited Inventory</br><br>Author: Shanshan Hu, Assistant Professor, Indiana University, Kelley School of Business, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, hush@indiana.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Mail-in-rebate and direct discount (i.e., instant rebate) are both used by retailers. However, their actual costs might be different in that, among the customers with mail-in-rebates, a sizable portion will fail to redeem them.

Our paper characterizes the optimal dynamic pricing and rebate offering policy, and establishes interesting insights into the above question.</br>
