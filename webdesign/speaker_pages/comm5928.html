Title: Dynamic Pricing and Mail-in-Rebate Design with Limited Inventory<br>Author: Shanshan Hu, Assistant Professor, Indiana University, Kelley School of Business, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, hush@indiana.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Mail-in-rebate and direct discount (i.e., instant rebate) are both used by retailers. However, their actual costs might be different in that, among the customers with mail-in-rebates, a sizable portion will fail to redeem them. The question arises: for a retailer with pressure to move inventory, how to use these tools, individually or concurrently? Our paper characterizes the optimal dynamic pricing and rebate offering policy, and establishes interesting insights into the above question.
