<br>Title: A Retailer-Driven Reverse Logistics Model</br><br>Author: Jie Li, Operations Research Analyst, Iowa State University, Black Engineering 2019, Ames, IA, 50011, United States, jieli@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jo Min</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a closed-loop retailer-driven reverse logistics model with product remanufacturing. The retailer in the supply chain acts as the Stackelberg leader and the used product returning is market-driven. We study the cases of the retailer vs. a third-party acting as the collecting agent. The pricing and resulting profits, the degrees of remanufacturing, and the policy implications for the model are explored analytically and numerically.</br>
