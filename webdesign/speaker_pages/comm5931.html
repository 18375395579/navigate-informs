Title: Organizational Decisions in Co-Development<br>Author: Svenja Sommer, Assistant Professor of Management, Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, 403 W. State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, ssommer@purdue.edu<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: In many industries the same supplier develops similar parts for several manufacturers. This creates a risk of information leakage, both about parts developed by the supplier and about final product characteristics. To prevent this, the aircraft industry typically requires its suppliers to create separate organizations, adding substantial costs by doing so. This research explores the circumstances under which requiring separate organizations at the supplier site benefits the manufacturers.
