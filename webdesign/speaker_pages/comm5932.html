We analyze the optimal strategy of a price-setting manufacturer who operates in two markets with uncertain demand and faces a gray market. We explore the impact of market conditions and product characteristics and provide insights about the viability of the uniform pricing policy that has been used by some companies to eliminate gray markets.</br>
