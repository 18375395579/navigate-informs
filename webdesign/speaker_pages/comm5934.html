Nick Street, Padmini Srinivasan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper examines a popular stock message board and finds that only 17.3 percent of posts include a user-provided sentiment of “strong buy? “buy? “hold? “sell? or “strong sell? but many of the remaining include sentiment only within the context of the post. Supervised learning methods were used to infer the sentiment from these posts' text and this predicted sentiment is found to be more predictive of the underlying stock's price directional change than the user-provided sentiment.</br>
