In recent years several big retailing firms have entered the market traditionally dominated by small mom-and-pop stores. We consider asymmetric competition between a small (budget constraint) and large (capitalized) retailer in a market comprising of multiple segments (poor and rich). Using simple model we illustrate how presence of large retailer impacts pricing and assortment decisions, and consumer welfare.
