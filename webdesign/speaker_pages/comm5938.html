<br>Title: Competition Dynamics in Cloud Computing Market</br><br>Author: Hossein Ghasemkhani, PhD Candidate, University of Washington, Foster School of Business, Seattle, WA, United States of America, hossein@uw.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yong Tan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the dynamic competition of forward-looking cloud computing providers using a differential game model with rate of capacity provision as the control variable. We derive the long-run stationary equilibrium and analyze the short-run strategies of the firms. We posit that although initial market shares do not affect the steady-state outcomes, initial capacities, budgets and cost of capacity provision are all important in determining the steady-state market structure and long-run profits.</br>
