<br>Title: Reputation, Trust, and Rebates: How Online Auction Markets Can Improve Their Feedback Mechanisms</br><br>Author: Lingfang Li, University of California, Irvine, 6336 Adobe Circle, Irvine, CA, 92617, United States, lingfanl@uci.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In current online auction markets only half of the buyers leave feedback after transactions, and nearly all of it is positive. This paper proposes a mechanism whereby  sellers can provide rebates to buyers contingent on buyers' providing reports.  In both a pure adverse selection model, and a model with adverse selection and moral hazard, there exists a pooling equilibrium where both good and bad sellers choose the rebate option, even though their true types are revealed through feedback.</br>
