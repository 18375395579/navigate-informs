Title: Inter-temporal Pricing and Consumer Stockpiling<br>Author: Xuanming Su, Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, xuanming@haas.berkeley.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a dynamic pricing problem for a class of products with stable consumption patterns over an infinite time horizon (e.g., household items, staple foods). Consumers may stock up the product at current prices for future consumption, but they incur inventory holding costs. We analyze the firm's equilibrium pricing strategies and consumers' equilibrium stockpiling strategies.
