<br>Title: Numerical Analysis of Optimal Product-line Design</br><br>Author: Chi-Guhn Lee, Associate Professor, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, cglee@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Ferreira</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this research we have developed an optimization framework to find a product-line, a collection of products with varying specifications and prices, which maximizes the expected total. We have performed optimization in various market situations to shed light on how optimal product-line reacts to changing market conditions. We also carried out the analysis on a large scale consumer survey.</br>
