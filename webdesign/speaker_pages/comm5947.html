Title: Value of Dynamic Pricing in a Decentralized Supply Chain<br>Author: Tamer Boyaci, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, tamer.boyaci@mcgill.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Saibal Ray, Yuyue Song<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We study a decentralized manufacturer-retailer chain in a two-period non-stationary framework with price-sensitive, stochastic correlated retail demand. We allow one or more retail and wholesale pricing (i.e. contracting) opportunities. We show how optimal decisions behave temporally and are affected by system characteristics. Comparing profits with the centralized scenario, we show how the value of pricing flexibility and the division of supply chain profits are influenced by decentralization.
