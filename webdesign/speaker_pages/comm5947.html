We allow one or more retail and wholesale pricing (i.e. contracting) opportunities. We show how optimal decisions behave temporally and are affected by system characteristics. Comparing profits with the centralized scenario, we show how the value of pricing flexibility and the division of supply chain profits are influenced by decentralization.</br>
