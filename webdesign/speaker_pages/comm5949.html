We demonstrate that, in many cases, the optimal strategy for coping with supply uncertainty is exactly opposite to the conventional wisdom from the OM literature on coping with demand uncertainty.  Using a combination of analytical and simulation studies, we illustrate this contrast in various settings, including risk pooling, inventory placement, supplier diversification, and others.</br>
