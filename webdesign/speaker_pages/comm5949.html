Title: Supply and Demand Uncertainty in Multi-Echelon Supply Chains<br>Author: Lawrence Snyder, Assistant Professor, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, larry.snyder@lehigh.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Zuo-Jun Max Shen<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: We discuss the effects of both demand and supply uncertainty in multi-echelon supply chains.  We demonstrate that, in many cases, the optimal strategy for coping with supply uncertainty is exactly opposite to the conventional wisdom from the OM literature on coping with demand uncertainty.  Using a combination of analytical and simulation studies, we illustrate this contrast in various settings, including risk pooling, inventory placement, supplier diversification, and others.
