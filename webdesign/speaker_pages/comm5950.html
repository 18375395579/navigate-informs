Title: Optimization of Fuel Contract Management and Maintenance Scheduling for Thermal Plants<br>Author: Niko Iliadis, Engineering Analyst, EnerCoRD, Plastira street 4, Nea Smyrni, Athens, 171 21, Greece, Niko.ILIADIS@EnerCoRD.com<br>Coauthor(s): Raphael Chabar, Sergio Granville, Mario PEREIRA<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This work presents a tool that determines, in an integrated approach, the optimal dispatch and maintenance schedule strategy of thermal power plants while considering the specifications of Take or Pay contracts. Electricity purchase and selling at the spot market and a detailed modelling of the power plant are considered during the optimization. The problem is time-coupled, multi-stage with stochastic electricity spot prices. The methodology applied is Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP).
