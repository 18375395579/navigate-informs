Title: Supply Chain Dynamics and Contracting in the Presence of Gray Market<br>Author: Mehmet Sekip Altug, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, maltug10@gsb.columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain with one manufacturer and several authorized retailers that face uncertain demand and a potential gray market. While the gray market can be seen as an opportunity to sell any excess inventory, it also is a threat for authorized retailer's demand. We characterize the equilibrium market-clearing gray market price and analyze how gray market changes the supply chain dynamics including certain contracts that are provided by the manufacturer to its authorized retailers.
