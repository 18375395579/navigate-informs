Each supplier offers all-unit quantity discounts. The buyer is allowed to submit multiple orders to the selected suppliers during a repeating order cycle. The buyer’s demand rate is price sensitive. The model finds the optimal number of orders and corresponding order quantities, and the optimal demand rate and selling price that maximizes the buyer’s total profit per time unit.</br>
