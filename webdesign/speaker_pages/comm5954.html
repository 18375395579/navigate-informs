<br>Title: Capacity and Inventory Control in a Two-Stage Supply Chain with Limited Information Sharing</br><br>Author: Fikri Karaesmen, Koc University, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, Istanbul, 34450, Turkey, fkaraesmen@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alper Altan, Selcuk Karabati</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a decentralized supply chain consisting of a retailer and a supplier. The retailer faces a Poisson demand process whose rate is price-sensitive and employs a base-stock inventory policy. The supplier operates a capacitated production system modeled by a queue. Optimal capacity, inventory and pricing decisions in this supply chain and their impacts are investigated under the assumption that some cost parameters are not common knowledge.</br>
