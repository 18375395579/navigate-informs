A number of these consumers arrive each period, each with an initial valuation that will be varying with time governed by a Markov chain. Consumers can buy the product and leave the “system?at anytime if the price at this time is below their valuation. Moreover, any consumer in the system might at some point stop being interested in the product and also leave. We look at finding the optimal pricing strategy that will maximize the long run average revenue function.</br>
