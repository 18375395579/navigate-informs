<br>Title: Remanufacturing Planning with Different Quality Levels for Product Returns</br><br>Author: Mark Ferguson, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Management, 800 W. Peachtree Street NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States, Mark.Ferguson@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gilvan Souza, Daniel Guide</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a remanufacturing production planning problem observed in such firms as Pitney Bowes and HP. Returns are categorized into a finite number of quality categories. Cost depends on the quality category; it is higher at worse levels of returns quality. We solve for the amount of each quality type return to remanufacture, inventory, or recycle each period so that all demand is met and total cost is minimized. Comparisons in costs are made against traditional production planning methods.</br>
