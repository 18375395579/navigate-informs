In particular, we find that increasing market uncertainty affects the value of responsive pricing adversely due to the spread effect and the manipulation effect. Furthermore, it can be shown that the price commitment can boost the seller's revenue substantially, and the information can be much more valuable under strategic consumers than under myopic consumers.</br>
