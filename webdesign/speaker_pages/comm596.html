Title: Effective Reputation Mechanisms<br>Author: Christina Aperjis, Stanford University, caperjis@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ramesh Johari<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: In online marketplaces potential buyers have to decide whether to buy an item and how much to pay for it without being able to observe it and without knowing whether the seller is trustworthy. Reputation mechanisms promote trust by giving information about past transactions. With the goal of incentivizing sellers to advertise truthfully, we study how the marketplace is affected by (i) the  reputation mechanism, and (ii) the way buyers interpret the seller’s reputation score.
