Title: Revenue Maximization using Dynamic Mechanism Design with Two-dimensional Buyers and Type Uncertainty<br>Author: Chaitanya Kaligotla, PhD Student, INSEAD, INSEAD Europe Campus, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, Chaitanya.KALIGOTLA@insead.edu<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: I study a decision problem to maximize seller revenue under two-dimensional buyer space with private information. I consider the general case of a single seller with a single good to sell to buyers with private attribute values arriving over 2 time periods.  I use dynamic mechanism design theory to find an incentive compatible mechanism for the seller. I investigate structural conditions for the optimal seller policy.
