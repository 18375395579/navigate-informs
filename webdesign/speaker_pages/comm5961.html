<br>Title: Unbundling Information Goods: An Empirical Analysis of Consumer Created Custom CDs</br><br>Author: Jesse Bockstedt, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, jesse.bockstedt@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kim Huat Goh</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We perform an empirical analysis of over 25,000 consumer-created custom CDs to gain insights into consumer behavior in the context of unbundling and customized bundling of information goods.  We find that slight differences in the pricing scheme have a dramatic impact on the distribution of bundle sizes.  We also analyze the bundle contents to determine whether consumers tend to create bundles of hits or long tail songs.  This paper provides insights for selling unbundled information goods.</br>
