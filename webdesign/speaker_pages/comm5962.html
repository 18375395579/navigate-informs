Michelle Chen, Prabhudev Konana</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This study investigates differentiated product competition for consumer consideration and choice in online retailers. We find that despite the greater product variety suggested by the Long Tail in online retailers, more than half of the purchase decisions are made by consumers considering two or fewer alternatives. The results show that being first considered by consumers plays a dominant role in product competition, and that pricing strategies only influence product competition for choice.</br>
