Title: A Revenue Management Approach to Product Recovery<br>Author: Mark Ferguson, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree Street NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, Mark.Ferguson@mgt.gatech.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Moritz Fleischmann<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Products coming off of lease are returned to the OEM’s remanufacturing facility where a disposition decision is made to either remanufacture the returned unit or to disassemble it to recover spare parts. The disposition decision contains the basic properties of a traditional revenue management (RM) problem. We exploit this analogy and formulate a RM model of the disposition problem.  We show that a RM approach can significantly enhance the value recovered, relative to current practice.
