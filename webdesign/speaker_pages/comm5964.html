Title: Supply Chain Coordination under Uncertainty in the Electricity Industry<br>Author: Carlos Ruiz Mora, University Carlos III de Madrid, Avda. de la Universidad, 30, Leganés, Spain, caruizm@est-econ.uc3m.es<br>Coauthor(s): Fernando Oliveira<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We propose a game-theoretical model to analyze the behavior and efficiency of the supply chain in electricity markets. We consider multiple generators and retailers that interact at different trading floors of the market and that simultaneously seek to maximize their respective profits. To this end, each agent anticipates the potential equilibria of the subsequent markets as well as the uncertainties associated to the final consumer’s behavior and the generation production costs.
