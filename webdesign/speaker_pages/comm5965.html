Title: Optimal Production and Subcontracting Policies in Assemble-to-Order Systems<br>Author: Ananth Krishnamurthy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States of America, ananth@engr.wisc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ashesh Kumar Sinha<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We consider an assembled-to-order manufacturing system where components required for assembly can be manufactured either in-house or by subcontracting. We use Markov decision process to evaluate tradeoffs (costs, lead times, service levels) and determine optimal production and subcontracting policies. Optimal policies are also compared with myopic policies used in practice.
