Title: Contractual Provisions to Mitigate Holdup: Evidence from Information Technology Outsourcing<br>Author: Anjana Susarla, University of Washington, asusarla@u.washington.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ramanath Subramanyam, Prasanna Karhade<br>Year: 2007<br>Abstract: Contractual incompleteness combined with the need for relationship-specific investments gives rise to the holdup problem in IT outsourcing. We suggest that extensibility terms in contracts reduce the holdup problem. We also find that extensibility terms are important even when contracts are well designed with respect to the extent of initial contingencies. We also test for ex post efficiency of contract design by examining contract renewals between firms and vendors.
