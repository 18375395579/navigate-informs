Title: Collateral Risk in Residential Mortgage Defaults<br>Author: Tyler Yang, President, IFE Group, 51 Monroe Street, Suite 801, Rockville, MD, 20850, United States of America, tyler.yang@ifegroup.com<br>Coauthor(s): Che-Chun Lin, Man Cho<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: This paper introduces a systematic framework to model the collateral house values underlying a mortgage portfolio.  Future house price dynamic is decomposed into time series volatility of the overall housing market fluctuation and cross sectional deviation of a particular house¡¦s growth rate from the overall housing market.  Such decomposition allows a mortgage investor or insurer to differentiate and better manage the systematic part from idiosyncratic part of mortgage default risk.
