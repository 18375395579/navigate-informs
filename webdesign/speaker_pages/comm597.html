Title: Feedback Pricing Policies<br>Author: Costis Maglaras, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, cm479@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Omar Besbes<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study a revenue maximization problem for a seller that is subject to a set of financial and sales milestone constraints. The goal is to choose a pricing policy that satisfies these constraints over time in a revenue maximizing manner, and the focus is in settings with limited or no market information. The motivating application is pricing of large scale real estate projects.
