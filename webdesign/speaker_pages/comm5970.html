Title: Price Distributions, Store Sequencing, and Strategic Shopping Behavior<br>Author: Sreekumar Bhaskaran, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, United States of America, sbhaskar@mail.cox.smu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): John Semple<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Building on empirical data that suggests buyers purchase groceries from multiple stores, we investigate the optimal sequence of store visits for items whose prices are unknown. We find that the shape of the price distribution plays an influential but sometimes non-intuitive role in lowering expected costs for the buyer. In addition,  randomizing prices at the store level improves equilibrium profits for both stores. Effect of loyal consumers on equilibrium prices are also investigated.
