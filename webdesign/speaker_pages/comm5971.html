Title: A Stochastic Multiple Leader Stackelberg Model: Analysis, Computation, and Application<br>Author: Victor de Miguel, Associate Professor, London Business School, Regents Park, London, UK, United Kingdom, avmiguel@london.edu<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We study an oligopoly consisting of M leaders and N followers that supply a homogeneous product. Leaders choose their supply levels first, knowing the demand function only in distribution. Followers make their decisions after observing the leader supply levels and the realized demand function. We show the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium, propose a computational approach to find the equilibrium, and apply this framework to model competition in the telecommunication industry.
