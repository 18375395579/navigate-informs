Title: Learning Customers?Preferences through Repetitive Sale Interactions<br>Author: Paulo Rocha e Oliveira, Assistant Professor of Marketing, University of Miami, United States, paulomiamiedu@yahoo.com.br<br>Coauthor(s): Rene Caldentey, Gabriel Bitran<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: Knowing customers' preferences enhances a firm's ability to design and offer the right menu of products. Learning is not free, and companies must allocate valuable resources if they really want to know their customers better. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off between the value and cost of learning. We use an axiomatic approach to develop a learning model and investigate how pricing policies can be used to speed up the learning process while maximizing the firm’s financial performance.
