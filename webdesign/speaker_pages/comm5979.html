Title: A Multi-period Equilibrium Pricing Model for Weather Derivatives<br>Author: Yongheon Lee, yhlee@ieor.berkeley.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Weather derivatives are gaining popularity as financial instruments for hedging price or volumetric risk, however pricing such instruments is challenging due to the lack of a valued underlying. We introduce a multi-period equilibrium pricing model based on supply and demand for weather derivatives that are determined dynamically from utility indifference pricing and portfolio optimization. A numerical example illustrates the equilibrium pricing methodology and hedging results.
