Title: Do Centrally Committed Markets Provide Useful Price Signals?<br>Author: Ramteen Sioshansi, Assistant Professor, The Ohio State University, 240 Baker Systems, 1971 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43215, United States of America, sioshansi.1@osu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ashlin Tignor<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: The promise of restructured electricity markets is that prices, that are computed in a day-ahead unit commitment, provide signals for generation and transmission to enter and exit the market. We show that the prices generated by a centrally committed market are highly sensitive to which near-optimal solution is used, resulting in variable generator profits. We also show that peaking generators and transmission zones most prone to congestion are most likely to experience such variability.
