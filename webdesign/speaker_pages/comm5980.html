Title: Optimal Pricing and Product Development Policies under Consumer Memory<br>Author: Hasan Arslan, Suffolk University, Boston, MA, 02108, United States of America, harslan@suffolk.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Soulaymane Kachani, Kyrylo Shmatov<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: We consider pricing and product development policies for successive product generations, when demand is impacted by the reference price and reference innovation level formed by consumers. We characterize the pricing and product development policies explicitly for two successive generations, and propose a general quasi-analytic solution. We also extend the analysis to a competitive environment. We derive Nash equilibria among firms adopting different pricing and product development policies.
