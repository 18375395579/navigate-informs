Tim Huh</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A multi-period model of a firm that replenishes inventory periodically and conducts auctions within each period to sell the product was recently studied by Van Ryzin and Vulcano (2004). In the absence of fixed costs for replenishment, they showed that the optimal replenishment policy has the order-up-to structure. With fixed costs, we show that the optimal inventory replenishment policy is of the (s,S) type. We also present extensions to other types of sales channels.</br>
