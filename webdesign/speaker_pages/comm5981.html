Title: Optimality of (s,S) Replenishment Policies for Inventory Systems with Heterogeneous Sales<br>Author: Ganesh Janakiraman, Assistant Professor, Stern School of Business, New York University, 44 West 4th Street, New York, NY, United States, gjanakir@stern.nyu.edu<br>Coauthor(s): W. Tim Huh<br>Year: 2006<br>Abstract: A multi-period model of a firm that replenishes inventory periodically and conducts auctions within each period to sell the product was recently studied by Van Ryzin and Vulcano (2004). In the absence of fixed costs for replenishment, they showed that the optimal replenishment policy has the order-up-to structure. With fixed costs, we show that the optimal inventory replenishment policy is of the (s,S) type. We also present extensions to other types of sales channels.
