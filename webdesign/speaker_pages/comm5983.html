Jack Hu, Goker Aydin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a complexity measure for an assembly supply chain, based on the information entropy. Using two potential applications (choosing the product variety to be offered by the supply chain and choosing between two given supply chain configurations), we study the degree of consistency between decisions made according to the complexity and decisions made according to the cost. The complexity measure is found to be particularly useful when choosing the level of product variety.</br>
