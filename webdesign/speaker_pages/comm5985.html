Lee<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: We analyze the investment decisions on responsible operations by suppliers under three sourcing modes: (1) spot market, (2) long-term relationships, and (3) long-term contracts. The results show that the sourcing mode can affect the supplier's investment decisions in non-trivial ways.
