We examine the impact of EPR policies on manufacturers?choice of optimal product design attributes and channel coordination incentives. We show how some commonly used contractual forms, such as two-part tariffs, quantity discounts, leasing, and buy-backs perform under EPR and their effect on product design, channel profits and environmental outcomes.</br>
