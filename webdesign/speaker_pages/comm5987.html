Title: Block T Discounts on the Internet<br>Author: John Wilson, Ivey School of Business, Univ. of Western Ontario, London, Canada, jwilson@ivey.uwo.ca<br>Coauthor(s): Jing Chen<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: Many of the new internet discount outlets have some form of a promotion involving T items offered at a discount price. Selling at a discount would cannibalise from the retailers current customers since they could buy at the cheaper price. However, it would take customers from the retailer’s competitors. For a wide class of distributions, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a promotion to be optimal.
