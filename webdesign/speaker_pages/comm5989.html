Title: Advertisement Allocation for Generalized Second Pricing Schemes<br>Author: Hamid Nazerzadeh, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, Palo Alto, CA, United States of America, hamidnz@stanford.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Ashish Goel, Mohammad Mahdian, Amin Saberi<br>Year: 2008<br>Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in algorithms that allocate advertisement space in an online revenue-competitive manner. Most such algorithms, however, assume a pay-as-you-bid pricing scheme. We show these algorithms fail to achieve a bounded competitive ratio if the ad space is priced using the widely-used generalized second price (GSP) scheme. On the positive side, we present algorithms to achieve constant competitive ratio.
