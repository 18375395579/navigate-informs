<br>Title: Effects on E-waste Regulation on New Product Introduction</br><br>Author: Qiong Wang, Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, NJ, United States of America, qwang@research.bell-labs.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erica Plambeck</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In our infinite-horizon model of new product introduction, firms set the development time and expenditure for each new version of a durable electronic product. Consumers?willingness to pay depends upon the time until the next new-and-improved product is introduced. E-waste regulations increase the equilibrium development time, R&D spending and hence product quality. The increase in development time reduces E-waste and also increases consumers?willingness to pay, which increases firms?profits.</br>
