When inventory level does not match with demand, transshipment across channels may be beneficial. We characterize and compare the effectiveness of the retailer's optimal pricing and transshipment policy. Furthermore, we investigate how the optimal pricing policy is affected by the transshipment policy, and vice versa.</br>
