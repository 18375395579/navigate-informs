Title: Dynamic Pricing or Dynamic Logistics?<br>Author: Thunyarat Amornpetchkul, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48104, United States of America, thunyara@umich.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Hyun-Soo Ahn, Ozge Sahin<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Retailers who sell their products through multiple channels often hold inventory at separate locations, dedicated for demand arriving at each channel. When inventory level does not match with demand, transshipment across channels may be beneficial. We characterize and compare the effectiveness of the retailer's optimal pricing and transshipment policy. Furthermore, we investigate how the optimal pricing policy is affected by the transshipment policy, and vice versa.
