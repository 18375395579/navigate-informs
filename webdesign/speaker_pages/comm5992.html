Title: In or Out? Competitive Aspects of Assortment Planning<br>Author: Victor Martínez de Albéniz, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, Av. Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, Valbeniz@iese.edu<br>Coauthor(s): H. Sebastian Heese<br>Year: 2013<br>Abstract: Retailers use their assortment planning decisions not only to maximize store profits but also to influence supplier competition. We present a model where the retailer can decide how much information can be passed onto the suppliers. We find that it is usually best to pre-announce the assortment breadth but not to declare which suppliers are included, as opposed to requesting bids from all candidates selected in the  assortment.
