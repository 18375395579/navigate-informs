We characterize conditions under which the supplier and a given retailer prefer that the retailer order pre- or post demand realization.  When the retailer prefers ordering after demand realization, we consider mechanisms the supplier can use to induce an early order, as well as the conditions under which it is in the supplier's best interest to apply these mechanisms.</br>
