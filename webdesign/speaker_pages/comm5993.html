Title: Order-timing Strategies and Incentives in a Multi-retailer, Single-period Setting<br>Author: Joseph Geunes, Associate Professor, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 303 Weil Hall, P.O.

We characterize conditions under which the supplier and a given retailer prefer that the retailer order pre- or post demand realization.  When the retailer prefers ordering after demand realization, we consider mechanisms the supplier can use to induce an early order, as well as the conditions under which it is in the supplier's best interest to apply these mechanisms.
