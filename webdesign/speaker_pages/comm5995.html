We find the publisher-coordinator contract to be a double-sided moral hazard problem, and the coordinator-advertiser contract a double moral hazard problem with agent¡¯s effort observed. We further show that an efficient pricing strategy has the power to deter click fraud, which is a major problem facing the internet advertising industry recently.</br>
