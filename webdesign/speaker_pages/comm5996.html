Title: Competitive Control of Market Goodwill and Strategic Exit<br>Author: Hongzhong Zhang, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, hz2244@columbia.edu<br>Coauthor(s): H. Dharma Kwon<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We consider the problem of two firms competing for market goodwill, which randomly evolves in time. Each firm can make irreversible investment to increase its goodwill to improve its profit stream and decrease its rival firm's goodwill.  They also have an option to exit the market at any point in time. We formulate the problem as a stochastic singular control and stopping game, and we obtain a rich variety of Markov perfect equilibria.
