Title: Managing the Customer Mix and Crowding for Shared Services via Pricing and Capacity Allocation<br>Author: Dimitris Kostamis, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Kenan-Flagler Business School, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, dimitris_kostamis@unc.edu<br>Coauthor(s): Serhan Ziya<br>Year: 2012<br>Abstract: We study a system serving two classes; within each class, customers are heterogeneous in their inherent willingness to pay for service, but their utilities are also affected by the type and number of other customers. Under price discrimination, an exclusive system can be optimal and that depends only on classes' perceptions about each other. Under a single price, an exclusive system is even more likely. We also show when and how the provider should allocate capacity to prevent class interaction.
