        <br>Title: Hierarchical Logistic Regression Model for Crystal Growth Processes</br><br>Author: Hongyue Sun, Virginia Tech, Grado Department of Industrial and Syste, m Engineering, 112 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, hongyue@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kaibo Wang, Xinwei Deng, Ran Jin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, modeling crystal growth process is crucial for enhancing the initial quality of silicon ingots and all downstream productions. However, such a process modeling poses great challenges due to complex functional data structures. In this work, we propose a hierarchical logistic regression model to address this challenge. Both a simulation and a case study in a continuous crystal growth process are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</br>
