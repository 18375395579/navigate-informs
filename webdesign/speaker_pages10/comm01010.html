        <br>Title: A Decision Analysis Framework for Water Quality Management Decision Support</br><br>Author: Bill Labiosa, US Geological Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd, MS-531, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, United States, blabiosa@usgs.gov</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: I describe a decision analysis framework for evaluating water quality management strategies using:  1) causal Bayesian networks to predict outcomes; 2) penalty functions on targets; and 3) hypothesis variables to model highly uncertain aspects of the management problem.  The framework allows the comparison of strategies, prioritization of studies, and the interpretation of new monitoring results in the context of hypotheses.  Since the penalties are parametric, non-consensus is allowable.</br>
