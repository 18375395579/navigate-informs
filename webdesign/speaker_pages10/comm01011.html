        <br>Title: Optimizer's Curse and Risk in Portfolio Selection</br><br>Author: Janne Kettunen, Assistant Professor, George Washington University, Department of Decision Sciences, 2201 G Street NW, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, jkettune@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ahti Salo</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: When selecting project portfolios using uncertain estimates of project value, projects whose values have been overestimated are more likely to be selected, thus resulting in post-decision disappointment. We examine how this affects the estimated and realized portfolio risk for different correlation structures of project values and estimation errors. Our results can be used to improve the accuracy of risk estimates and the design of project portfolio selection processes in general.</br>
