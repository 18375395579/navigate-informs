        <br>Title: Combining Multiple Subjective Probabilities: Applications to Aviation Safety Risk Assessment</br><br>Author: Kazim Topuz, PhD Student, Rutgers University, Department of Industrial & Systems Engin, 96 Frelinghuysen Road CoRE Building, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, mktopuz@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): James T. Luxhoj</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We focus on combining subjective probabilities in aviation safety.  We used Subject Matter Experts in probability elicitation for separate risk assessment models.  A composite model requires combining subjective probabilities.  We proposed three probability combining protocols: Rational Combination is inspired by the Expected Utilization Theory; Irrational Combination is inspired by Prospect Theory; Realistic Combination involves using the results of the individual models selected to combine.</br>
