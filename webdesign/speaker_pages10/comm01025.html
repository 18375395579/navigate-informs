        <br>Title: STRONG: A Design-of-experiment-based Simulation Optimization Framework</br><br>Author: Hong Wan, Assistant Professor, School of IE, Purdue Univ., 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, hwan@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kuohao Chang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: STRONG  is a newly developed DOE-based simulation optimization framework. It has nice convergence guarantee and does not require human intervention in the process. We will present a general version of STRONG which relaxes the normal assumption of the responses (compared to the traditional response surface methodology) to any general distribution with bounded second moment.</br>
