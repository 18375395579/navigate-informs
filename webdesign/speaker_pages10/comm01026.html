        <br>Title: A Fast Swap-based Local Search Procedure for Location Problems</br><br>Author: Renato Werneck, Researcher, Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, 1065 La Avenida, Mountain View, CA, 94043, United States, renatow@microsoft.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mauricio G. C. Resende</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a new implementation of a widely used swap-based local  search procedure for the P-median problem, proposed in 1968 by Teitz and  Bart. It produces the same output as the best alternatives described in  the literature and, even though its worst-case complexity is similar,  it can be significantly faster in practice: speedups of up to 3 orders  of magnitude were observed.  We also show that our method can be easily  adapted to implement path-relinking and tabu search.</br>
