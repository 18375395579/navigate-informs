        <br>Title: Nonlinear Problems in Efficiency Analysis under Multiple Perspectives</br><br>Author: Xiaopeng Yang, University of Toronto, 200 College Street, Toronto, ON, Canada, xiaopeng.yang@utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hiroshi Morita, Joseph Paradi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Multiple perspectives have different input/output classifications, which always result in nonlinear problems in either efficiency evaluation or improvement processes. To address such problems, we propose a new DEA model by incorporating SQP method into actual calculation. An application in banking sector is used to validate our model.</br>
