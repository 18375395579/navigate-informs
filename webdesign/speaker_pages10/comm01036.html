        <br>Title: Scoring Rules and the Measurement of Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Eric Bickel, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, C2200, Austin, TX, United States of America, ebickel@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Strictly proper scoring rules (SPSRs) continue to play an important role in probability assessment. While many such rules have been developed, relatively little guidance exists as to which rule is the most appropriate. All SPSRs reward calibration. In this presentation, we focus on how differing rules reward sharpness and argue that log scoring is the only rule that is consistent with entropy as a measure of uncertainty.</br>
