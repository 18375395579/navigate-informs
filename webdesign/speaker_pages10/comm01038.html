        <br>Title: How Much Is a Model Upgrade Worth?</br><br>Author: Sven Sandow, Director, Quantitative Analytics, Standard & Poor's, 55 Water Street, 46th Floor, New York, NY, 10041, United States, sven_sandow@standardandpoors.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Huang, Craig Friedman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We compute, from the point of view of an expected-utility-maximizing  investor, the monetary values of probabilistic models that are used for financial decision-making. In the case of nearly homogeneous returns, the value of a model upgrade can be approximated by a function of the likelihood ratio.</br>
