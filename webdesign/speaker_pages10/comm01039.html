        <br>Title: Aggregating Aircraft Mission Capable Rates to Determine Total Airlift Availability</br><br>Author: Bill Cunningham, Professor of Logistics Management, AF Insitute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way, Bldg 641, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, United States of America, william.cunningham@afit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Johnson, Alan Johnson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine the Logistics Balanced Scorecard metrics for aircraft Mission Capable (MC) rates and recommend a MC rate aggregation method for families of aircraft and a method for defining the mission areas of Red, Yellow, and Green stop light standards used by the Air Force. We used an Analytic Hierarchy process to classify aircraft in terms of speed, range, and payload.  Capability-weighting factors were developed to enable standardization to a C-17 equivalent.</br>
