        <br>Title: Feature Subset Selection as a Bi-Objective Optimization Problem</br><br>Author: Belén Melián, University of La Laguna, Dpto. E.I.O. y Computación, La Laguna, Spain, mbmelian@ull.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marcos Moreno, Miguel García, Jose Moreno-Perez</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In feature subset selection applied to supervised classification, given a set of labelled instances, a model is induced with a subset of features to classify new non-classified instances. In this work we use a scatter search metaheuristic to solve the feature subset selection problem, in which both the classification error and the features subset size have to be minimized.</br>
