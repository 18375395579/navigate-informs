        <br>Title: Large-scale Expensive Black-box Function Optimization using an Adaptive Radial Basis Function Method</br><br>Author: Kashif Rashid, Principal Research Scientist, Schlumberger-Doll Research, 1 Hampshire Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, krashid@slb.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Benoit Couet, William Bailey</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Optimization of a computationally expensive black-box reservoir simulation model of many variables is demonstrated using an adaptive radial basis function method. The iterative proxy-based scheme is used to tune the control variables, distributed for finer control over a varying number of intervals covering the total simulation period, to maximize asset NPV. The method shows that large-scale simulation-based function optimization of several hundred variables is practical and effective.</br>
