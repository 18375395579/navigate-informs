        <br>Title: Model Free Stability Results in Clustering</br><br>Author: Marina Meila, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, Department of Statistics, Box 354322, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, mmp@stat.washington.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: If we have found a good clustering C of data set X, can we prove that C is not far from the (unknown) best clustering C ) for two clustering cost functions: the Normalized Cut and the squared distance cost of  K-means clustering. These bounds exist in the case when the data X admits a good clustering for the given cost.</br>
