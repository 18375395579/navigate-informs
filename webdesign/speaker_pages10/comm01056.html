        <br>Title: Modeling and Analysis of Surgical Demand in the Operating Room</br><br>Author: Ian Moore, Queens University, Dept. Math and Stats., Kingston, ON, Canada, icmoore@mast.queensu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Thomson, David Strum</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We investigated daily surgical demand at a large trauma hospital using Thomson's multitaper spectral estimator method and a harmonic F-test to extract the periodic components from the time series.  We employed an ARIMA model to investigate model residuals and showed the residuals were close to Gaussian post extraction. Finally we will present an analytical description of our model in state space format and discuss issues with detecting variance patterns in the remaining residuals.</br>
