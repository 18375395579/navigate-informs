        <br>Title: System-level Study of Metabolism in Yersinia Pestis Using a Genome-scale Mathematical Model</br><br>Author: Ali Navid, Microbial Systems Biology Group, Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab, 7000 East Ave, L-452, Livermore, CA, 94550, United States, navid1@llnl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eivind Almaas</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Mathematical methods such as network optimization are critical tools for analysis and use of the ever-growing deluge of biological data.  Here we report the successful coupling of linear optimization and genomic data with the aim of developing a system-level model of metabolism in the aetiological agent of the bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis.  The model predictions were compared with experimental observations to ensure the accuracy of the model and completeness of our metabolic network.</br>
