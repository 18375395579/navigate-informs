        <br>Title: A Simple Expansion Formula for Local Volatility Model</br><br>Author: Yingda Song, PhD Candidate, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Department of Industrial Engineering, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, ysong@ust.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ning Cai</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes a simple expansion formula for European options  under local volatility model.
