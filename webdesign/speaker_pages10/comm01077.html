        <br>Title: Monitoring Process Quality in Multistage Systems</br><br>Author: Paul Zantek, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, pzantek@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a monitoring method for detecting process quality changes in multistage systems.  The proposed method can also help identify the source(s) of such changes.  The performance of the method is studied, both analytically and numerically, and compared to that of existing methods.</br>
