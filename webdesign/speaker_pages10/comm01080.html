        <br>Title: Data Fusion for Degradation Modeling and Prognostic Analysis based on a Specified Degradation Model</br><br>Author: Kaibo Liu, Ph.D Candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, kbliu@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jianjun Shi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present a methodology for developing a composite health index for better characterizing the performance of a system through the selection and fusion of multiple sensor data based on a specified degradation model. This methodology includes data selection, data processing, and data fusion steps which can lead to an improved prognostic result. Our methodology was evaluated by a degradation dataset of an aircraft gas turbine engine that was generated by C-MAPSS.</br>
