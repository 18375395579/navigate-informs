        <br>Title: Determining Tolerable Dosages with Multiple Responses and Multiple Predictors</br><br>Author: Edward Boone, Associate Professor of Statistics, Virginia Commonweath University, 1001 West Main Street, Richmond, VA, 23112, United States of America, elboone@vcu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Determining tolerable dosages/exposures to toxic substances is often complicated by ill defined endpoints that can be measured by multiple outcome variables.  This is further complicated by having multiple stressors/predictors.  This talk presents a novel method for determining tolerable dosages using a Bayesian approach for this situation.</br>
