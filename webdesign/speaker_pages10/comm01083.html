        <br>Title: A Duality Theory for Set-valued Risk Measures and Applications</br><br>Author: Andreas Hamel, Princeton University, E-Quad, ORFE, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, ahamel@princeton.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We extend the concept of set-valued coherent risk measures introduced  2004 by Jouini et al. to set-valued monotone and cash-invariant risk measures and establish primal representation results in terms of acceptance sets. For the convex case, we give a complete duality theory. Examples are given among them set-valued counterparts for (negative) expectation, VaRs and AVaRs, the (negative) essential infimum and the entropic risk measure. Applications to risk allocation problems are discussed.</br>
