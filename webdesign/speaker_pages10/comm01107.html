        <br>Title: Multivariate Process Control of Process Variation</br><br>Author: Amit Mitra, Associate Dean, Auburn University, College of Business, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849-5240, United States, mitra@business.auburn.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In monitoring variability of processes involving multiple variables, control charts based on the generalized sample variance matrix are utilized. The measures are typically based on the variability of process output variables. In this paper, we consider variability in the process regulatory variables as well as those in the noise factors.</br>
