        <br>Title: Importance Sampling Methodology for Multidimensional Heavy-tailed Random Walks</br><br>Author: Jose Blanchet, Columbia University, &#8207;500 W 120th St # 450, 3rd Floor, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, jose.blanchet@columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Estimating small first-passage time probabilities for multidimensional heavy-tailed random walks involves an interesting interplay among the drift, the dependence of the coordinates and the position of a target set. We construct an importance sampling estimator with uniformly bounded coefficient of variation. The construction of our estimator hinges on a Lyapunov inequality that bounds its second moment. Moreover, it involves interesting connections between linear algebra and regular variation.</br>
