        <br>Title: Monitoring Nonlinear Profiles using Wavelet Filtering and B-Spline Approximation</br><br>Author: Shing Chang, Associate Professor, Kansas State University, 228 Durland Hall, Manhatta, Ka, 66506, United States of America, changs@ksu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A statistical process control framework is proposed to monitor nonlinear profiles. The proposed methodology identifies mean shifts or “shape changes?in a profile. Discrete wavelet transformation is applied to separate variation or noise from profile contours. B-splines are adopted to generate critical points to define the shape of a profile.</br>
