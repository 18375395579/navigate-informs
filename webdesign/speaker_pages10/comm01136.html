        <br>Title: Steep-Slope Sampling for Gaussian Process Model</br><br>Author: Lulu Kang, Assistant Professor, Department of Applied Mathematics, Illinois Institute of Technology, 10 W 32nd Street, E1-208, Chicago, IL, 60615, United States of America, lkang2@math.iit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): C.F. Jeff Wu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we develop a steep-slope sampling method for Gaussian process (GP) model. GP model has been known for its accurate prediction and extensive computation. To adapt the GP model for large data set, we propose a sampling approach called steep-slope sampling. The sampling probability of each observation is promotional to its correponding pseudo-derivative. Then the GP model is built using the sampled observations. Sequential procedure is developed to increase the prediction accuracy.</br>
