        <br>Title: Issues in Simulation of Process Execution Monitoring and Adjustment Schemes</br><br>Author: Dr. Russell Barton, Professor, Penn State, Department of Supply Chain and Informati, 406 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, rbarton@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jun Shu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: SPC methods can be applied to monitor the timeliness and correctness of the movement of physical or virtual entities through a process.  Comparison of process execution statistical monitoring methods with each other, or with traditional process execution management rules, can require sophisticated discrete-event simulation models.  We discuss the practical issues in building and using simulation models to study process execution monitoring schemes.</br>
