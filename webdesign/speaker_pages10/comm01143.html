        <br>Title: Restricted Error Regression - Some Preliminary Results</br><br>Author: James Cochran, Louisiana Tech University, College of Administration & Business, PO Box 10318, Ruston, LA, 71055, United States, jcochran@cab.latech.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the benefits and ramifications of restricting regression analyses so the error terms satisfy the conditions necessary for valid inference (homoskedasticity, normality, independence, and linearity/fit). Specifically, we assess the difficulty and time required to solve the resulting constrained nonlinear optimization problem. We appraise the validity of standard summary statistics and hypothesis tests for the restricted error regression.</br>
