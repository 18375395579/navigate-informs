        <br>Title: Bayesian Networks for Automatic Optimization Algorithm Selection</br><br>Author: Patricia Hough, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 969, MS 9159, Livermore, CA, 94551, United States, pdhough@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victoria Howle</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a two-phase approach to automatically selecting an optimization algorithm to solve a given simulation-based problem.  We first use a Bayesian network to classify an optimization problem based on its canonical description.  We then use probabilistic models of human expert recommendation combined with experimental performance data to choose a suitable algorithm.  Finally, we discuss initial studies on test problems and challenges associated with simulation-based problems.</br>
