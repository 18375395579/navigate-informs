        <br>Title: Utility of Dependence, Departure from Independence, and Bayesian Reliability</br><br>Author: Ehsan Soofi, Distinguished Professor, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Lubar School of Business, P.O. Box 742, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States of America, esoofi@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nima Jalali, Nader Ebrahimi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We formulate dependence in terms of the utility of predicting a variable from other variables. This approach integrates ideas from classic literature on dependence, the Bayesian expected utility in terms of uncertainty reduction, and measuring departure of a dependent model from the independence. We present applications to lifetime models such as Bayesian predictive joint distribution of components of a system and shock models, and Bayesian test of equality of parameters of lifetime models.</br>
