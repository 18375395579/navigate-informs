        <br>Title: A Bayesian Approach to Stochastic and Robust Optimization</br><br>Author: Constantine Caramanis, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, ENS 426, Mail Code C0803, 1 University Station, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, cmcaram@ece.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shie Mannor</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we consider a Bayesian approach to optimization under uncertainty, driven by data observations. We explore the complexity of such an approach, proving some negative results, while also providing a framework that yields a tractable algorithm for encorporating data in a Bayesian framework. We further consider asymptotic properties, stability properties, and relationship to traditional solution formulations from robust and stochastic optimization.</br>
