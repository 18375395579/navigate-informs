        <br>Title: Time-Tradeoff Sequences for Quantifying and Visualising the Degree of Time Inconsistency</br><br>Author: Han Bleichrodt, Erasmus University, PO Box 1738, Rotterdam, ZH, Netherlands, bleichrodt@bmg.eur.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Arthur Attema, Peter Wakker, Kirsten Rohde</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose time-tradeoff (TTO) sequences as a new tool to measure temporal discounting. TTO sequences make it easy to observe and exactly quantify deviations from constant discounting. They are easy to measure, do not need any assumption about utility, and allow for the empirical discrimination between several hyperbolic discounting models that have been proposed in the literature. Experimental testing of TTO sequences suggests some new directions for theories of intertemporal choice.</br>
