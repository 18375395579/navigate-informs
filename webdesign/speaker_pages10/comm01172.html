        <br>Title: A Novel Support Vector Data Description Algorithm</br><br>Author: Poovich Phaladiganon, PhD Candidate, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, United States of America, poovich.phaladiganon@mavs.uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim, Victoria Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Support vector data description (SVDD) is a one-class classification technique, which generates spherical boundary.  The goal is to maximize the number of observations and minimize the radius of sphere.  The boundary is determined by support vectors (SVs).  However, the boundary generated from SVDD does not consider the data density.  Thus, we utilize SVs to incorporate data density into SVDD.  The preliminary research shows that the proposed method performs better than the existing one.</br>
