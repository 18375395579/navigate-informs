        <br>Title: A Probabilistic Model for Assessing the Mortality Risk in Post-operative Patients</br><br>Author: Dmytro Korenkevych, 372 Maguire Village, Apt. 1, Gainesville, FL, 32603, United States of America, dmitriy@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Petar Momcilovic, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We used a probabilistic model based on Bayesian learning and optimization techniques to estimate the mortality risk in post-operative patients. The model incorporates discrete and continuous risk factors and provides a probabilistic score associated with the risk. The feature selection procedure was applied in order to discard irrelevant risk factors and 70/30 cross-validation analysis was performed to estimate the accuracy of the model.</br>
