        <br>Title: Semiparametric Bayesian Replacement Strategies</br><br>Author: Refik Soyer, Professor, Department of Decision Sciences, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, soyer@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jason Merrick</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider repairable systems that are subject to wear. We present a semi-parametric model by specifying a gamma process for cumulative intensity function and by taking into account effect of covariates by a parametric form. Use of the gamma process prior complicates the Bayesian analysis when the updating is based on failure count data. We develop a Bayesian analysis of the model using MCMC methods, which involves a data augmentation algorithm, and determine replacement strategies.</br>
