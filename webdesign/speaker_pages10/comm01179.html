        <br>Title: System Improvement Using Random Search in Simulation Studies</br><br>Author: Russell Cheng, University of Southampton, School of Mathematics, Southampton, Ha, SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom, R.C.H.Cheng@soton.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the use of simulation to optimize system performance under convexity assumptions, but using random search. There are two types of random variation: one occurs because system performance will vary according to the alternatives randomly searched, the other occurs because it will usually not be possible to make simulation runs long enough to determine system performance without noticeable error. We discuss how to model both types of variation and estimate their effect.</br>
