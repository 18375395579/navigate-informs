        <br>Title: Dynamic Spatiotemporal Warping for the Detection and Localization of Heart Attacks</br><br>Author: Chen Kan, University of South Florida, United States of America, chenkan@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Yang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI), also known as heart attack, is the leading cause of death. This paper presents a novel warping approach to quantify the dissimilarity of disease-altered patterns in 3-lead VCG signals. The hypothesis testing shows there are significant space-time signal pattern variations between healthy controls (HC) and various MIs. The new approach yields an accuracy of 94.7% for separating MIs and HCs and an accuracy of 96.5% for anterior-related MIs and inferior-related MIs.</br>
