        <br>Title: Market Price-based Convex Risk Measures: A Distribution-free Optimization Approach</br><br>Author: Jonathan Li, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, jli@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roy Kwon</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We extend a well-known risk measure that measures the impact of uncertainty  resulting from mis-specification of derivative models by using an  optimization-based approach that uses distributions based on non-parametric  specification. This allows for incorporation of a much wider class of  distributions that results in more revealing measures. Our risk measure can be  formulated as a semi-definite optimization problem and can be efficiently  solved.</br>
