        <br>Title: Spatiotemporal Pattern Recognition of Multi-Channel Sensing Data for Health Applications</br><br>Author: Chen Kan, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Ave. ENC 1205, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, chenkan@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Yang, Gang Liu, Yun Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Multi-channel sensing data are increasingly available in healthcare environments. This paper presents a novel spatiotemporal warping approach to quantify the dissimilarity of multi-channel profiles of cardiovascular function. Furthermore, functional profiles from each patient are embedded as a node in a high-dimensional complex network. This, in turn, greatly facilitates the recognition of disease patterns and smart health management.</br>
