        <br>Title: Performance-based Regularization in Mean-CVaR Portfolio Optimization</br><br>Author: Gah-Yi Vahn, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, United Kingdom, gvahn@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Noureddine El Karoui, Andrew Lim</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We introduce performance-based regularization (PBR), a new approach to addressing estimation risk in data-driven optimization, to mean-CVaR portfolio optimization. We assume the available log-return data is iid, and detail the approach for two cases: nonparametric and parametric (the log-return distribution belongs in the elliptical family). We show  that the PBR methods produce efficient frontiers that are, on average, closer to the population efficient frontier with less variability.</br>
