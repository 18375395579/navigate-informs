        <br>Title: An Efficient, Accurate, and Valid FMEA Priority Ranking Methodology</br><br>Author: James Bradley, Associate Professor, College of William and Mary, Mason School of Business, P.O. Box 8795, Williamsburg, VA, 23187-8795, United States of America, james.bradley@mason.wm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hector Guerrero</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: One shortcoming of an FMEA priority ranking is that it requires an invalid mathematical operation.  Methodologies proposed to resolve this issue, however, are more complex or more opaque to the decision-maker than the standard approach, or they misrepresent the decision-maker’s intentions.  We propose a ranking methodology that is efficient, reflects decision-makers?preferences accurately, and that is valid according to measurement theory.  We validate our approach with an empirical experiment.</br>
