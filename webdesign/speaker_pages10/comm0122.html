        <br>Title: Multiobjective Forest Management Model with Uncertain Weights</br><br>Author: Cristian D. Palma, Universidad del Desarrollo, Faculty of Industrial Engineering, Santiago, Chile, cristianpalma@ingenieros.udd.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): John D. Nelson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Defining weights in a multiobjective optimization framework is a difficult task, especially when many actors are involved in the decision-making process. We present a robust version of a multiobjective multiperiod forest management problem in which the weights are defined as a continuous range of possible values, and show that robust decisions produced more stable outcomes through the planning horizon than deterministic ones when weights may change over time.</br>
