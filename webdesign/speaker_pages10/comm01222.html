        <br>Title: Clustering Multiple Instance Data</br><br>Author: Erhun Kundakcioglu, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, erhun@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Onur Seref, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The multiple instance (MI) setting was introduced by Dietterich et al. for drug activity prediction and became a popular concept in supervised learning applications where incomplete information is available. We propose a novel MI setting for clustering, where a subset of data points are to be neglected during the regular clustering procedure. This approach is useful for biomedical applications where the aim is to discover the time of stimulus and detect the semantic features.</br>
