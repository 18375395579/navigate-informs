        <br>Title: Simulation-Optimization of Control Chart and Preventive Maintenance Policies</br><br>Author: Rajesh Swaminathan, Graduate Student, University of Arkansas, Bell Engineering, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, rswamin@engr.uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Pohl</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The problem combines the economic design of a control chart with the optimization of preventive maintenance policies.  The research areas of control chart design and preventive maintenance have received a great deal of attention separately in the quality and reliability research communities.  Our problem investigates the use of GA’s and ant colony optimization in simultaneously selecting parameters for a control chart (X-bar, EWMA) as well as the best replacement period for equipments.</br>
