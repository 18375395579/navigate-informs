        <br>Title: Process Modeling and Control Strategies based on Approximated Gaussian Processes</br><br>Author: Chia-Jung Chang, Assistant Professor, The Pennsylvania State University, 310 Leonhard Building, Universirt Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, cchang@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Gaussian process provides a powerful methodology for capturing the dynamics of a complicated system. However, the fitted Gaussian process model based on real data may lead to an over complex prediction model which makes it difficult for implementing control strategy to fulfill the purpose of system performance improvement. In this work, we develop a methodology to obtain an approximating Gaussian process model which provides the feasible control ability.</br>
