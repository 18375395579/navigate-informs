        <br>Title: Mixture-process Experiments Within a Split-plot Structure</br><br>Author: Connie Borror, Associate Professor, Arizona State University West, 4506 W. Kaler Circle, Glendale, AZ, United States of America, conni@asu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Mixture experiments involve factors that are components of a mixture or ingredients. The levels of the mixture components cannot be set independently of one other. Process variables are factors whose levels can be set independently of one another.  In some experimental situations, mixture components may be affected by changes in the process variables. Analysis of mixture-process experiments when some process variable levels are hard to change (producing a split-plot structure) will be discussed.</br>
