        <br>Title: Multiple Instance Learning Via Margin Maximization</br><br>Author: Erhun Kundakcioglu, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, erhun@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Onur Seref, Panos Pardalos, Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) refers to classification of unseen bags based on the labeled bags of instances as the training data. We first consider the margin maximization problem for multiple instance data and prove that the problem is NP-hard. We also propose solution methods and present computational results on publicly available data sets.</br>
