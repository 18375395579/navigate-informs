        <br>Title: A Discretization Method for Approximating ARL with the Markov Chain Method</br><br>Author: Chang-Ho Chin, Assistant Professor, Kyung Hee University, 1 Seocheon-dong, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Korea, Republic of, chin@khu.ac.kr</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The integral equation method and the Markov chain method are generally used to approximate the ARL of control charts. The former is more accurate than the latter. However, the integral equation method cannot be used with certain kinds of control charting problems. Although the Markov chain method is more versatile, it has an important limitation in implementation &#8722; a memory space problem due to the large state space. A discretization method to alleviate the difficulty is discussed.</br>
