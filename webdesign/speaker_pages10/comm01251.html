        <br>Title: Generating Multiple Solutions for Mixed Integer Programming Problems</br><br>Author: Emilie Danna, ILOG, Inc., 889 Alder Avenue, Suite 200, Incline Village, NV, 89451, United States, edanna@ilog.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zonghao Gu, Roland Wunderling, Mary Fenelon</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Decision makers like to use subjective criteria in conjunction with optimization software. Applications of this type that use MIP models would benefit from having several different good-quality solutions available, instead of a single optimal solution. We present a  modification of the branch-and-bound algorithm available in CPLEX that  generates multiple solutions significantly faster than previously known  algorithms, while providing an acceptable level of diversity in the  solutions produced.</br>
