        <br>Title: Bayesian Sequential Detection and Isolation of an Unobservable Change</br><br>Author: Savas Dayanik, Assistant Professor, Princeton University, ORFE, E-Quad, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, sdayanik@princeton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Goulding, H. Vincent Poor</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Suppose that the characteristics of a stochastic process change suddenly at an unobservable time to one of several alternatives. The problem is to detect simultaneously the change time and change type as quickly as possible after change happens. In a Bayesian setup we describe an optimal sequential decision rule and illustrate it on numerical examples.</br>
