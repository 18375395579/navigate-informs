        <br>Title: Stochastic Programming with Log-exponential Convex Measures of Risk</br><br>Author: Alexander Vinel, University of Iowa, 3131 Seamans Center, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, alexander-vinel@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pavlo Krokhmal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We aim to address the problem of decision-making under uncertainty in the case of heavy-tailed distributions of losses. In our study we introduce a family of risk measures, which we call log-exponential risk measures, and show that they posses important methodological properties, such as convexity. We expect, that the introduced measures may be suitable to model risk-averse decision making in the presence of catastrophic risk, and our case study with real-life data showed promising results.</br>
