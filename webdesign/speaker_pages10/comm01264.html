        <br>Title: Characterization of Demand using Leading Indicators</br><br>Author: S. David Wu, Dean of Engineering, Lehigh University, 19 Memorial Drive West, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, sdw1@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Berrin Aytac</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We developed a methodology that identifies leading indicators of demand trends. The core technique is a statistical method that examines the demand pattern of a given group of products and identify leading indicators that demonstrate patterns that predict the demand characteristics for the entire group. In this talk, we will discuss the use of multiple leading indicators as a variance reduction technique that improves the accuracy of existing forecasting methods.</br>
