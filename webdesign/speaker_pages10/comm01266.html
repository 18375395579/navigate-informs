        <br>Title: Evolutionary Algorithms in Addressing Contamination Threat Management in Civil Infrastructure</br><br>Author: Ranji Ranjithan, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, ranji@ncsu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Accurate and timely characterization of contaminant source in water distribution systems is an important problem, with challenges such as resolution of non-uniqueness and adaptive optimization.  An ongoing investigation of an evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based simulation-optimization approach coupled with system simulation models is presented.  New EA-based search procedures will be described and illustrated for resolving non-uniqueness and adaptive optimization under dynamic data environments.</br>
