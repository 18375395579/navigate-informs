        <br>Title: Classification Methods for Highly Imbalanced Class Sizes in Warranty Data</br><br>Author: Eunshin Byon, Texas A&M University, United States of America, esbyun@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding, Abhishek Shrivatsava</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This talk will analyze a set of warranty data encountered in quality control practice. The main challenge for data-mining operations is the small number of faulty units in a lot, implying a highly skewed distribution of the response variable.  We propose a statistical procedure to handle this class-imbalance data-mining problem and apply it to a real dataset from a cell phone manufacturer. Our method performs significantly better than some well known off-the-shelf data-mining methods.</br>
