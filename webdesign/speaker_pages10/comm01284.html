        <br>Title: Time Series Models for High Frequency Integer-valued Data; Applications in EMS Call Forecasting.</br><br>Author: Spencer Hays, Assistant Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, 1015 Floyd Avenue, Harris Hall, Room 4130, Richmond, VA, 23284-3083, United States of America, shays@vcu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: With the increasing sophistication of data collection, count data can be reliably collected to a near infinitesimal degree of fineness. With such high frequency of measurement, it is more realistic that measured data are discrete samples of continuous processes, rather than discrete Poisson processes. Applications include EMS call forecasting and other big data problems.</br>
