        <br>Title: Gurobi Optimization - Gurobi Compute Server, Distributed Tuning Tool and Distributed Concurrent MIP Solver</br><br>Author: Zonghao Gu, Gurobi Optimization Inc., 3733-1 Westheimer Rd., #1001, Houston, TX, 77027, United States of America, gu@gurobi.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We will present the Gurobi Compute Server, which allows you to seamlessly offload your optimization computations onto one or more dedicated optimization servers. We will also discuss the design and features of Gurobi Compute Server, and how to use it to build and deploy an application locally or in the cloud. Lastly, we will talk about our distributed features based on the Gurobi Compute Server, such as our new distributed automatic parameter tuning tool and distributed concurrent MIP solver.</br>
