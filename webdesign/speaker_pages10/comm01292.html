        <br>Title: Faster MIP Solutions via Prediction of the Optimum</br><br>Author: John Chinneck, Professor, Carleton University, Systems and Computer Engineering, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, ON, K1S5B6, Canada, chinneck@sce.carleton.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Wojtaszek</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: MIP solution effort can be reduced by changing the node selection rules. We predict the depth of the leaf during a depth-first dive and use this information to estimate the optimum objective function value.  This aspiration level then triggers backtracking out of dives that are not likely to reach optimality.  Empirical results are presented.</br>
