        <br>Title: Click Logs Analysis for e-Commerce</br><br>Author: Si-Chi Chin, The University of Iowa, 3087 LIB, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, si-chi-chin@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): W. Nick Street</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Click logs from e-Commerce sites provide a rich opportunity to acquire implicit feedback from users. Patterns derived from the time between a posted query and a click provide information on the ranking quality, reflecting the perceived relevance of a retrieved URL. This presentation applies the Kaplan-Meier estimator to study click patterns. The observed results demonstrate the potential of using click curves to predict the quality of the top-ranked results.</br>
