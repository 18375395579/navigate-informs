        <br>Title: The Utility of Reliability and Survival</br><br>Author: Nozer Singpurwalla, Distinguished Research Professor, George Washington University, Department of Statistics, 2140 Penn. Av., Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, nozer@gwu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: It is by now a well appreciated fact that the purpose of reliability and life testing is to make coherent decisions. Utility is a key element of decision making. In this talk I propose a model for eliciting a decision maker's utility for reliability. The model is motivated by the Rasch Model of item response theory. I describe how the model can be invoked in practice and propose a statistical approach for estimating the model parameters. I conclude by presenting a real life case study.</br>
