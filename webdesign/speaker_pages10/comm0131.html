        <br>Title: Wavelet Features from Wireless Vibration Sensor Array for Container Integrity Monitoring</br><br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Associate Professor, School of Industrial Engineering & Management, Oklahoma State University, 322 EN, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States, bsatish@okstate.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Of late, security and integrity of transportation container has assumed significant importance. Hurst exponents computed from wavelet analysis of vibration signals are found to capture the underlying burst patterns. The various integrity measures of a container, such as stability of the contents, terrain characteristics and transportation speed are estimated through the use of Hurst exponent and entropy features extracted through wavelet analysis of vibration signals.</br>
