        <br>Title: Automated Time Series Forecasting for Biosurveillance</br><br>Author: Galit Shmueli, Assistant Professor, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, gshmueli@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Howard Burkom, Sean Murphy</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: For robust detection performance, alerting algorithms for biosurveillance require input data free of trends, day-of-week effects, and other systematic behavior. We describe three forecast methods and compare their predictive accuracy on each of 16 authentic syndromic data streams. The methods are 1) a nonadaptive loglinear regression model using a long historical baseline, 2) an adaptive regression model with a shorter, sliding baseline, and 3) the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method.</br>
