        <br>Title: A Probabilistic L1–Method For High Dimensional Clustering</br><br>Author: Tsvetan Asamov, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Rd, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, tsvetan.asamov@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Adi Ben-Israel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Distance–based methods for clustering or classification of high–dimensional data often suffer from the unreliability of distances in very high–dimensional spaces. We propose a probabilistic clustering method based on the L1–distance that is less sensitive to the high dimensionality. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in the dimension of the data space, and its performance was observed to improve significantly as that dimension increases.</br>
