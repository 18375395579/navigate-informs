        <br>Title: Robustness of the N-CUSUM Stopping Rule</br><br>Author: Hongzhong Zhang, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, 928, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, hz2244@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Neofytos Rodosthenous, Olympia Hadjiliadis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the quickest change-point detection in a N-dimensional correlated Brownian system. It is assumed that the drifts after the changes are time invariant, but that their sizes and onset times may differ. The objective is the optimal detection of the first time at which any component in the system receives a drift. Under an extended Lorden’s performance index, we prove that the N-CUSUM stopping rule is asymptotically optimal as the mean time to the first false alarm increases without bound.</br>
