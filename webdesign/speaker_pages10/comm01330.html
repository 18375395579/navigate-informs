        <br>Title: Mining Social Media to Predict China Stock Market</br><br>Author: Yibo Chen, City University of Hong Kong, Department of Management Sciences, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, chenyibo@cityu.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tao Yan, Wenbin Zhu, Andrew Lim</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We employ text mining tools and statistical models to forecast China stock market movement based on collective online viewpoints of individual investors. We quantify the collective viewpoints by analyzing and aggregating their online posts related to the stock market, where the main challenge lies in the Chinese semantic analysis. Our statistical results suggest that there exists a strong causality relation between the collective viewpoints from Sina micro blog and China stock market movement.</br>
