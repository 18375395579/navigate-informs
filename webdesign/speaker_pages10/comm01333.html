        <br>Title: A DEA-based Method for Uncertain Productions</br><br>Author: Regina Fuchs, University of Hohenheim, Lehrstuhl Industriebetriebslehre (510A), Schloss, Osthof Nord, Stuttgart, 70599, Germany, regfuchs@uni-hohenheim.de</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Production is often influenced by uncertain variables which cannot be quantified. Thus at different moments we may observe different values of output for the same input and vice versa. This contribution discusses a DEA-based methodology that considers this uncertainty in efficiency measurement. Instead of comparing one single observation for each plant with the production possibilities we will use a sample of observations, which describes the production possibilities of the plant itself.</br>
