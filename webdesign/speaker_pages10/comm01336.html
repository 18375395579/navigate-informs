        <br>Title: Identifying the Time of Linear Change in the Mean of ARMA(p,q) Processes</br><br>Author: Marcus Perry, Florida International University, West Flagler Street EC 3172, Miami, FL, United States of America, perrym@fiu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, a maximum likelihood estimator for the time of linear change in the mean of an ARMA(p,q) processes is presented.  We outline the development of the estimator under the general ARMA framework, and provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the application of the proposed estimator.  We also present results of a Monte Carlo simulation study used to evaluate the expected performance of the estimator following EWMAST control chart signals.</br>
