        <br>Title: A Degradation Model of Solar Panel Efficiency under Dynamic Conditions</br><br>Author: Xiao Liu, Research Staff Member, IBM Research Collaboratory Singapore, 9 CBP 1, The IBM Place, Singapore, 486048, Singapore, liuxiao@sg.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Based on real experimental data, a statistical degradation model is developed for solar panel efficiency at dynamic environmental conditions. We also compare our model to conventional degradation models without considering the environmental conditions.</br>
