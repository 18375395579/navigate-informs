        <br>Title: Knowledge, Causality, and Hierarchy in System Design</br><br>Author: Roger Bohn, Professor, University of California - San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive #0519, IR/PS, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0519, United States, Rbohn@ucsd.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Although we design using hierarchies and modules, products and systems don't actually behave accordingly.  Knowledge about them can be described using causal graphs, and these graphs generally contain extensive linkages among nominally independent subsystems. Such knowledge is hard to learn, but critical to good design.</br>
