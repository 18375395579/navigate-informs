        <br>Title: Ab Initio Whole Genome Shotgun Assembly</br><br>Author: Paul Medvedev, University of Toronto, Deparment of Computer Science, 10 King's College Road, Room 3302, Toronto, ON, M5S3G4, Canada, pashadag@cs.toronto.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Brudno</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are capable of reading millions of short DNA sequences both quickly and cheaply. In this talk, we give a novel network flow-based algorithm for ab-initio genome assembly.  By taking advantage of the high coverage provided by NGS, it accurately estimates the copy counts of repeats in a genome. We also give a second algorithm that combines the predicted copy-counts with mate-pair data in order to assemble the reads into contigs.</br>
