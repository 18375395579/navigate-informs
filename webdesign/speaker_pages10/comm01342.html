        <br>Title: Evolutionary Designs for Robust Parameter Design Experimentation</br><br>Author: Eduardo Santiago, The Pennsylvania State University, 350 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, eus146@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Enrique Del Castillo</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In Robust Parameter Design, Crossed Array and Mixed Resolution designs have been suggested as alternative ways to perform experimentation. However, different constraints make some of these designs inadequate. We present the application of an evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) to produce optimal designs in terms of D and G optimality. The methodology presented allows the user to produce new experimental designs according to specific needs in number of runs, model and design space.</br>
