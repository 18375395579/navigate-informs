        <br>Title: Phase I Analysis of Optical Profiles in Low-E Glass Manufacturing</br><br>Author: Smriti Neogi, Graduate student, The University of Texas at Arlington, 500 West First Street, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, smriti.neogi@mavs.uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Li Zeng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Low-emittance (low-E) glass manufacturing has become an important sector of the glass industry due to its benefits in energy efficiency. One critical quality characteristic in low-E glass manufacturing processes is optical profiles measured on glass surface. In this study, a hybrid method is proposed for Phase I analysis of such profile data which integrates polynomial modeling, independent component analysis and nonparametric change detection procedures.</br>
