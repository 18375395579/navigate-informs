        <br>Title: Recent Advances in Remote Sensing Data Mining: Small Learning Sample Case</br><br>Author: Raju Vatsavai, Research Scientist, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, PO.Box 2008. MS-6017, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831, United States of America, vatsavairr@ornl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Budhendra Bhaduri</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a review of recent advances in remote sensing (RS) data mining, especially in the area of classification with few training samples. Recently significant efforts were placed on methods that use large number of unlabeled samples in conjunction with small number of labeled samples (aka semi-supervised learning). Here we present various extensions of semi-supervised learning, including spatial and multi-source cases, along with classification results on real RS images.</br>
