        <br>Title: In Situ Liquid STEM for Observing, Controlling and Quantifying Individual Nanoparticle Growth</br><br>Author: Nigel D. Browning, Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, WA, 99352, United States of America, Nigel.Browning@PNNL.Gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Evans</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A key first step to studying transient processes in materials science, chemistry and biology is to control the environment around the sample. In this presentation, I will discuss the development and implementation of an in-situ liquid stage that permits atomic resolution imaging of samples in solution. The functionality of this stage has a wide range of applications including visualizing and quantifying the nucleation and growth of individual nanoparticles.</br>
