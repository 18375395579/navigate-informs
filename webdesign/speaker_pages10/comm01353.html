        <br>Title: The Accuracy of Search Heuristics: An Empirical Study on Knapsack Problems</br><br>Author: Meinolf Sellmann, Assistant Professor, Brown University, sello@cs.brown.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Leventhal</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Theoretical models for the evaluation of search strategies are based on assumptions regarding the probability that a value selection heuristic makes a correct prediction. We provide an empirical evaluation of value selection heuristics for knapsack problems. We investigate how their accuracy varies as a function of depth in the search-tree, and how they are affected by the relative strength of inference methods like pruning and constraint propagation.</br>
