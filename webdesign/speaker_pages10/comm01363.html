        <br>Title: A General Bayesian Inference Procedure for Accelerated Tests</br><br>Author: Thomas Mazzuchi, George Washington University, 1776 G Street NW, EMSE Suite 101, Washington, DC, 20052, United States, mazzu@gwu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This talk presents development of a general model for accelerated life testing using the Bayesian paradigm. Both design and inference implications will be discussed. The inference procedure uses the well-known Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to derive posterior approximations. The approach is illustrated with an example.</br>
