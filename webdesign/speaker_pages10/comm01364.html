        <br>Title: Risk Assessment of GPS Spoofing</br><br>Author: Mihaela Quirk, Technical Staff Member, Los Alamos National Laboratory, PO Box 1663, MS 603, Los Alamos, NM, 87545, United States, pal@lanl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roger Johnston, Jon Warner, Edward Bitzer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Civilian Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers may be subjected to  attacks such as blocking, jamming, and spoofing.  This paper gives a methodolgy to assess the risk of GPS spoofing.  Probabilistic estimation is employed to process historical data on technology development.  The data on GPS spoofing is sparse, hence expert elicitation embeded into an approximate reasoning engine is used for risk evaluation.</br>
