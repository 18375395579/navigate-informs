        <br>Title: An Adaptive Methodology for the Quick Identification of Space-time Anomalies</br><br>Author: Michael Porter, North Carolina State University, Box 8203, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States, porter@stat.ncsu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This talk discusses an approach to anomaly detection (a specific type of change where the change occurs in a local region of space) for space-time point processes. Besides estimating the rate of change and change point, we also estimate the anomalous spatial region. This added complication leads us to adaptively estimate the unknown pre and post change parameters, thus expanding the common GLR, CUSUM, and Shiryaev-Roberts change detection methodologies.</br>
