        <br>Title: Self-Insurance Choices with INTER-period and INTRA-period Utility Functions</br><br>Author: Matthew Sobel, Professor, Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH, 44106-7235, United States, matthew.sobel@case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Danko Turcic</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We contrast optimal self-insurance choices with alternative models having inter-period versus intra-period utility functions.  After reviewing the axiomatic foundations of the models, we show that the intra-period model biases the decisions towards too little self insurance.  This result has implications for diverse settings in which the chosen size of an early commitment affects the magnitude of a subsequent risky consequence.</br>
