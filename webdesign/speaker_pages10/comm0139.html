        <br>Title: Simulation-based Estimation of Cycle Time using Quantile Regression</br><br>Author: Nan Chen, Assistant Professor, National University of Singapore, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 1 Engineering Drive 2,, Singapore, 129789, Singapore, isecn@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shiyu Zhou</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Production cycle time is an important performance measure, and it is of interest to characterize its distributional properties comprehensively. This article proposes a non-linear quantile regression model for the relationship between stationary cycle time quantiles and the throughput rates of a manufacturing system. The statistical properties of the estimated cycle time quantiles are investigated and the impact of dependent data from simulation output on parameter estimations is analyzed.</br>
