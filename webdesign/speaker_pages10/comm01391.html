        <br>Title: Efficient Modeling Abstractions for Simulating the Wafer Fab and the AMHS</br><br>Author: Jesus Jimenez, Assistant Professor, Texas State University-San Marcos, Ingram School of Engineering, 601 University Drive, San Marcos, TX, 78666-4616, United States of America, jesus.jimenez@txstate.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Simulation models representing the wafer processing steps and the automated material handling systems (AMHS) are used for wafer fab design. However, it takes too much time to build and analyze such models. This research presents several abstraction methods for simulating the fab at lower levels of detail, seeking to accurately and efficiently appraise the fab capacity and the AMHS. Our results show that some abstractions generate good performance estimates while reducing computational time.</br>
