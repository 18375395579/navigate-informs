        <br>Title: Statistical Analysis and Modeling of Wafer Variation</br><br>Author: Lulu Bao, PhD Candidate, Tsinghua University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Beijing, 100084, China, baoll11@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kaibo Wang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The aim of this work is to establish a statistical model for silicon wafer thickness which can be used to help monitor and control the quality of wafers. In the work, the failure mode of the wafer thickness data is discovered by statistics and analysis. And on that base, a model to describe wafer thickness is built. The within wafer variation is modeled using Gaussian Markov random fields while the wafer-to-wafer variation is reflected using the different changing directions of wafer thickness.</br>
