        <br>Title: Classification of Drug Activities for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer Using MILP</br><br>Author: Metin Turkay, Asst. Prof., Koc University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Sariyer, Istanbul, 34450, Turkey, mturkay@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): M.

We address early prediction and classification of activities of drug candidates using the MILP based hyper-box approach with partial least squares regression to determine the most significant molecular descriptors of the drug molecules for an efficient classification. Our results indicate that it is possible ti obtain a 100% classification accuracy.</br>
