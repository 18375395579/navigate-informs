        <br>Title: Structural Similarity Measures for the VRP</br><br>Author: Arne Lokketangen, Arne.Lokketangen@hiMolde.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Woodruff</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A decision maker might be equally interested in a set of different, good solutions, than in just the optimal solution. There is thus a need to distinguish between good solutions, based on some other concept than quality alone. We produce measures of difference of the type proposed in the Psychology literature . We suggest several such functions for the class of VRP problems, basing our difference on the underlying structure of solutions.</br>
