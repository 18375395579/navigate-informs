        <br>Title: Active Information Acquisition for Clustering and Classification</br><br>Author: Maytal Saar-Tsechansky, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, Maytal.Saar-Tsechansky@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The role of data-driven intelligence is becoming critical for supporting business decisions. Often the underlying data available for induction can be enhanced by acquiring unknown values. I will discuss and present experimental results of policies that aim to improve induction by acquiring new information cost-effectively. The policies employ estimations to enable effective ranking of potential acquisitions in settings where relatively little information is available about the underlying domain.</br>
