        <br>Title: Copulas-based Dependent Decision Lattice Approach</br><br>Author: Tianyang Wang, Assistant Professor, Colorado State University, Finance and Real Estate Department, Fort Collins, CO, United States of America, tianyang.wang@business.colostate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joe Hahn, James Dyer</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we present a general framework of a copulas-based dependent decision lattice approach for correlated uncertainties. The proposed dependent decision lattice model allows multiple dependent uncertainties with arbitrary marginal distributions to be represented in a recombining tree structure. This general framework significantly reduce the size of the tree for practical applications in decision analysis, real options valuations, and financial derivatives valuation.</br>
