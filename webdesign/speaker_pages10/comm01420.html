        <br>Title: Large Portfolio Loss: Conditionally Gaussian Approximations</br><br>Author: Justin Sirignano, Stanford University, 3 Gibbs Court, Irvine, CA, United States of America, jasirign@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kay Giesecke, Konstantinos Spiliopoulos</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We extend previous asymptotic results for the loss in a large credit portfolio by proving a first-order correction.  This conditionally Gaussian approximation satisfies a stochastic partial differential equation and is shown to offer accurate approximations to the finite portfolio loss distribution.  Numerical methods are developed to simulate the approximating loss.</br>
