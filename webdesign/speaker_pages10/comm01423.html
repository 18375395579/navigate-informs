        <br>Title: Estimating Quantile Sensitivities</br><br>Author: Jeff Hong, Assistant Professor, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Department of IE and Logistics Mgmt., Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, hongl@ust.hk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Quantiles of a random performance serve as important alternatives to the usual expected  value. They play very important roles in risk management. For instance, they are  used in financial industry as measures of capital adequacy and in service industry as  measures of service quality. To control or optimize the quantile performance, we need  to know how changes in the input parameters affect the output quantiles, which are  called quantile sensitivities. In this paper we show that there exists a closed form of  quantile sensitivity, which is in the form of a conditional expectation. Based on this  form, we first propose an infinitesimal-perturbation-analysis (IPA) estimator. The IPA  estimator is asymptotically unbiased, but it fails to be consistent. We then obtain a  consistent estimator by dividing data into batches and averaging the IPA estimates of  all batches. We also show that the estimator satisfies a central limit theorem for the  i.i.d. data. Therefore, the confidence intervals of the estimator can be constructed. The  numerical results show that the proposed estimator and confidence intervals work well  for practical problems.</br>
