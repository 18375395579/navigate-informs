        <br>Title: Nested Rare Event Simulation in Risk Management</br><br>Author: Jie Xu, Assistant Professor, George Mason University, 4400 University Dr, MS 4A6, GMU Engr Bldg RM2100, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, jxu13@gmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anand Vidyashankar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Nested simulation is an important tool in assessing actuarial and financial risks. When the loss function involves extreme percentiles, use of Monte Carlo simulations within nested simulations will render the simulation solution inefficient. We address this problem by introducing a nested rare event simulation solution and describe the theoretical properties of our algorithm. We establish consistency and efficiency of our algorithm and provide a precise description of the simulation cost.</br>
