        <br>Title: The Complexity of Creating a National Health Security Preparedness Index</br><br>Author: Evin Jacobson, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, United States of America, wqm4@cdc.gov</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: With input from more than 25 stakeholder organizations, the developmental draft of the National Health Security Preparedness Index was shared with states for feedback on April 2, 2013. The Index contains 120 candidate measures from 35 data sources. We analyze the complex process of rolling measures together to give a single value. Particularly we focus on statistical challenges such as determining outliers and weights for the measures as well as satisfying independence and normality assumptions.</br>
