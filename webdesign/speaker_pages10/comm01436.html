        <br>Title: Inverse Subordinators and Their Applications in Financial Modeling</br><br>Author: Yutian Nie, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridon Rd, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, YutianNie2016@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Linetsky</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate a class of stochastic processes called inverse subordinators, i.e., hitting time processes of increasing Levy processes. They are generally non-Markovian semimartingales that can be embedded in two-dimensional Markovian processes. We show their long range dependence (LRD) property and propose a two-factor model based on Levy processes time changed with inverse subordinators. We obtain analytical solutions for European options via Fourier inversion and Hilbert transform methods.</br>
