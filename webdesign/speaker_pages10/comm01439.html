        <br>Title: Monitoring Correlation within Nonlinear Profiles Using Mixed Models</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Birch, Professor, Virginia Tech, 406-A Hutcheson Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States, jbbirch@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Willis Jensen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Previous work on profile monitoring of nonlinear profiles has assumed that the measurements within a profile are uncorrelated. We propose the use of a nonlinear mixed model (NLMM) to account for the correlation structure. Our approach results in charts with good abilities to detect changes in Phase I data.</br>
