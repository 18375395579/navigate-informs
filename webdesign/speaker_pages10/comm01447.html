        <br>Title: Detecting Orbitopal Symmetries</br><br>Author: Timo Berthold, Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB), Takustr. 7, Berlin, 14195, Germany, berthold@zib.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc E. Pfetsch</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Symmetries are present in many IP models, but they are usually not desirable, since they derogate the performance of IP-solvers. Symmetries for which blocks of variables encode an assignment structure can be effectively handled with so-called orbitopes. We present an algorithm that detects orbitopal symmetries. It bases on the analysis of the IP's constraint graph. Furthermore, we show that the detection of orbitopal symmetries is as hard as the graph isomorphism problem for bipartite graphs.</br>
