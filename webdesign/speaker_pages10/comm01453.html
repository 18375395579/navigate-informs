        <br>Title: Online Automatic Process Control Using Observable Noise Factors for Discrete-part Manufacturing</br><br>Author: Judy Jin, Associate Professor, Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, IOE 2855, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, jhjin@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Different from offline robust parameter design (RPD) method, this research is to develop automatic process control methodology (APC) based on DOE response models for process variation reduction. A cautious control strategy, which explicitly considers the observation uncertainty in adjusting the settings of controllable factors, makes the system performance consistently more favorable when compared with the certainty equivalence control strategy and RPD.</br>
