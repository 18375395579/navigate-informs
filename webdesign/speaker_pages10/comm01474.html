        <br>Title: Petit Mal Seizure Detection Algorithm for Evaluating Antiepileptic Drug Effect</br><br>Author: Petros Xanthopoulos, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 11659, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, petrosx@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gregory Holmes, Steffen Rebennack, Jicong Zhang, Panos Pardalos, Basim Uthman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: For typical absence seizures there is sudden onset of 3 Hz generalized bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical spike- or multiple spike-and-slow wave complexes. In this study we present a wavelet variance based algorithm for detecting continoous spike and wave ac-  tivity. Then this activity in classi¯ed in seizure and non seizure activity and the e®ect of the antiepileptic drug (AED) under investigation is studied.</br>
