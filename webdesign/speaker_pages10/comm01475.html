        <br>Title: Managing Uncertainty and the Control of Risks in Decision Analysis</br><br>Author: Shweta Agarwal, PhD Candidate, LSE, London, United Kingdom, S.Agarwal@lse.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gilberto Montibeller</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In Decision Analysis models uncertainties are traditionally treated as external and thus ‘uncontrollable? However, in practice, managers often have levers to manage uncertainty and hence control risks. We propose representing this in influence diagrams as stochastic interventions (changing the probability distribution of state variables) that represent causal influences and model the corresponding probability revision using stochastic matrices. This technique can be useful in risk management.</br>
