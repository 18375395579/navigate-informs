        <br>Title: Distance-based Supertrees</br><br>Author: David Fernández-Baca, Professor, Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, fernande@cs.iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jianrong Dong, Mukul S. Bansal</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A phylogenetic tree represents the evolutionary history of a set of species:  leaves correspond to species and internal nodes represent hypothetical ancestors.  We study the problem of aggregating a collection of phylogenetic trees for partially overlapping subsets of a set of species into a single supertree that contains all the species.  We formulate this question as a median problem by defining various distance measures between trees.</br>
