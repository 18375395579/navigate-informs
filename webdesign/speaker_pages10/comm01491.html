        <br>Title: The Support Vector Decomposition Machine</br><br>Author: Geoff Gordon, Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science, Department of Machine Learning, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, ggordon@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In learning problems with many more features than training examples, dimensionality reduction can be essential. Some previous work has treated such problems in two phases: first reduce dimensionality using, e.g., an SVD, then classify using, e.g., an SVM.  Instead, we combine the two phases into a single learning objective, and present an algorithm which optimizes this objective directly. We demonstrate our algorithm classifying fMR brain images according to what subjects are thinking about.</br>
