        <br>Title: Supersparse Linear Integer Models for Predictive Scoring Systems</br><br>Author: Berk Ustun, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, ustunb@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stefano Traca, Cynthia Rudin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Supersparse Linear Integer Models (SLIM) are highly interpretable classification models that only require users to add, subtract and multiply a few meaningful numbers in order to generate a prediction. In this work, we show how to create SLIM scoring systems using mixed-integer programming, and present experimental results to show that these scoring systems are both accurate and sparse in comparison to state-of-the-art classification models.</br>
