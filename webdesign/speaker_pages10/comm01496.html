        <br>Title: MoPriGA: A Multiple Objective Prioritized Genetic Algorithm</br><br>Author: Heidi Taboada, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 W. University Av., El Paso, TX, 79902, United States, hataboada@utep.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Coit</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A newly developed multiple objective evolutionary algorithm is presented. MoPriGA, a multiple objective prioritized genetic algorithm, incorporates the knowledge of the decision-maker objective function preferences directly within the evolutionary algorithm. The idea behind this algorithm is to more intensely focus on the region of the Pareto set of interest to the decision-maker.</br>
