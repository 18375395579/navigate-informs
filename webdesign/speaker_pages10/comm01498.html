        <br>Title: Rognostics-based Identification of the Top-k Units in a Fleet</br><br>Author: Nagi Gabraeel, Assistant Professor, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, nagi@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This talk presents a novel approach that identifies the top-k (the k most reliable) units in a fleet using sensor-based prognostic information.  The proposed Prognostics-Based Ranking Algorithm (PBR-Algorithm) combines prognostics-based stochastic degradation models with state-of-the-art computer science based database ranking algorithms.</br>
