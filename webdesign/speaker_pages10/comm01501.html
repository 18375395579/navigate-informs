        <br>Title: A Data Mining Approach for Multivariate Statistical Process Control</br><br>Author: Thuntee Sukchotrat, University of Texas at Arlington, 500 W.First St.,?Box 19017,?420K Woolf, Arlington, TX, United States, tsukchotrat@uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seoung Bum Kim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a data mining approach for multivariate statistical process control. By using classification techniques, our proposed method can utilize both the in-control and out-of-control data information to build a control chart. The probability that a data point belongs to a certain class from classification result is plotted.</br>
