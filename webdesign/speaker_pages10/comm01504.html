        <br>Title: Pricing Asian Options via Compound Gamma and Orthogonal Polynomials</br><br>Author: Bacel Maddah, Associate Professor, American University of Beirut, Bliss Street, Beirut, Lebanon, bm05@aub.edu.lb</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hrayer Aprahamian, Joe Naoum-Sawaya</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop two novel approximations (CG3 and CGn) for arithmetic Asian options. CG3 utilizes a compound Gamma distribution of the price average. It is calibrated by analytically matching the first three moments.  CG3 outperforms many other approximations in the literature, on both accuracy and CPU time.  CGn expands CG3 utilizing the concept of orthogonal polynomials from Physics, and matches n > 3 moments.  CGn produces mostly near-“exact?results within one second.</br>
