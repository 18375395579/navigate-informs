        <br>Title: Planning of Accelerated Degradation Tests for Robust Design of Manufacturing Quality Parameters</br><br>Author: Jye-Chyi (JC) Lu, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30022, United States, jclu@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lingyan Ruan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Typical experimental designs for accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) assume that products are from the same manufacturing condition. This talk proposes a framework of designing ADTs for selecting manufacturing conditions that lead to longest product percentile lifetime, minimized variance of lifetime estimates and also least sensitivity of environmental noise factors creating variation of product reliability.</br>
