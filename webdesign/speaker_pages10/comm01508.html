        <br>Title: DA Tools for Communication between Modelers and DMs</br><br>Author: Mayank Mohan, Research Assistant, USC - CREATE, 1124 W 29th Street, #12, Los Angeles, CA, 90007, United States of America, mayank_mg@yahoo.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: User interaction is important for decision analysis models. This helps incorporating expert judgment on the values variables may take. It assists in keeping the model input dynamic. To achieve this level of user interaction we use tools like influence diagrams, color coding to ascertain bounds of variable values, user input using sliders and other control mechanisms. In this presentation we briefly demonstrate some of the tools using a real life example.</br>
