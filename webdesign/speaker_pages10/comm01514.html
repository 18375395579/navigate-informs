        <br>Title: Robust Risk Measurement and Model Risk</br><br>Author: Xingbo Xu, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, Rm. 313, New York, NY, 10025, United States of America, xx2126@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Glasserman</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Abstract Financial modeling is subject to model risk, and it can be amplified by combining optimization. We use relative entropy and Alpha-divergence to quantify model risk, and convert expectation optimization problems into robust problems. We exam various financial models and their vulnerability to model risk, where we compare the nominal models, their worst scenarios and candidate perturbations. We find uncertainty in parameters inadequate to describe the worst scenarios in most cases.</br>
