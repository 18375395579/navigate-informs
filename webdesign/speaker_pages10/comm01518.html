        <br>Title: A Simple Bayesian Regression Diagnostic to Account for Bias</br><br>Author: Theodore Allen, Associate Professor, Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, allen.515@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ravishankar Rajagopa</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: To provide diagnostic information about the bias and other summative information, we propose a model diagnostic that can be used like adjusted R2 but which explicitly accounts for bias errors. Unlike the Cp statistic, our proposed diagnostic can be estimated even if the bias sources are inestimable using ordinary least squares. The proposed diagnostic has the simple interpretation of being the expected plus or minus prediction errors in the units of the response.</br>
