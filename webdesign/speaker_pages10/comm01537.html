        <br>Title: Arc Reversals in Hybrid Bayesian Networks with Deterministic Variables</br><br>Author: Prakash P. Shenoy, Distinguished Professor, University of Kansas, School of Business, 1300 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS, 66045-7585, United States of America, pshenoy@ku.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Hybrid Bayesian networks contain a mix of discrete and continuous chance variables. A continuous chance variable in a Bayesian network representation is said to be deterministic if the variances of its conditional distributions are all zeroes. Arc reversals are used in making inferences in hybrid Bayesian networks and influence diagrams. We describe arc reversals between all possible kinds of pairs of variables.</br>
