        <br>Title: Approximate Methods for Dynamic Portfolio Choice with Learning</br><br>Author: Poomyos Wimonkittiwat, University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, poomyos@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Lim</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop approximate methods for dynamic portfolio choice problems with hidden states, where the transition probabilities may also need to be learned. We derive semi-explicit expressions for the optimal policy which can be implemented using tools from MCMC.</br>
