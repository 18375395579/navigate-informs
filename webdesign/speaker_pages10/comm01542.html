        <br>Title: Monitoring Progress of Branch-and-Bound Algorithms</br><br>Author: Osman Ozaltin, Graduate Student, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, ozaltn@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brady Hunsaker</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The most common methods to monitor the progress of branch-and-bound algorithms have drawbacks, particularly the fact that they do not improve monotonically. We consider new methods for monitoring the progress of branch-and-bound algorithms using the data extracted from the branch-and-bound tree. Our goal is to provide users with more useful information about the progress of the algorithm as well as the likelihood of it finding better solutions.</br>
