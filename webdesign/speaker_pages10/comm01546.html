        <br>Title: Modeling and Solving Non-convex Robust Portfolio Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Daniel Bienstock, Columbia University, dano@ieor.columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Robust optimization is a technique for building 'robustness', in a qualitative sense, into solutions to optimization models.  Real-world data uncertainty arising in the portfolio optimization context can exhibit non-convexities as well as hidden correlations among groups of assets.  In this talk we describe continuing work in the solution of robust optimization problems with these features.</br>
