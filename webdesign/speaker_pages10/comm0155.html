        <br>Title: IPOPT in a Software Package for Dynamic Optimization</br><br>Author: Yi-Dong Lang, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, lang@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andreas Waechter, Lorenz Biegler</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A software package, DynoPC, uses IPOPT as the NLP solver to solve discretized dynamic optimization problems simultaneously. It invokes ADOL-C to evaluate constraints, Jacobians and Hessians required by IPOPT, based on user-supplied models. The package has been updated according to new developments of IPOPT, and tested on challenging examples.</br>
