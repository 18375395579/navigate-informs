        <br>Title: Domain Decomposition Approach for Fast Gaussian Process Regression of Large Spatial Data Sets</br><br>Author: Chiwoo Park, Assistant Professor, Florida State University, 2525 Pottsdamer St., Tallahassee, FL, 32311, United States of America, cpark5@fsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jianhua Huang, Yu Ding</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a domain decomposition approach for fast computation of Gaussian process regression with a focus on large spatial data sets. The new approach has comparable or better computation complexity as other competing methods, but it is easier to be parallelized for faster computation. Moreover, the method can be adaptive to non-stationary features because of its local nature and, in particular, its use of different hyperparameters of the covariance function for different local regions.</br>
