        <br>Title: A Network Flow Approach to Select Significant Patterns in Large-scale Data Analysis</br><br>Author: Munevver Mine Subasi, Assistant Professor, Florida Institute of Technology, Department of Mathematical Sciences, 150 W. University Blvd, Melbourne, FL, 32901, United States of America, msubasi@fit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Juan Felix Avila-Herrera</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Current implementations of Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) use greedy-type heuristics to select patterns to form a classification model. We present a network flow based approach to identify significant patterns to generate an LAD model. Our approach allows the user-specified requirements such as statistical significance, Hamming  distance, homogeneity, hazard ratio and/or prevalence of patterns. We present experiments on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.</br>
