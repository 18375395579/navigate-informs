        <br>Title: Refining Decision Rules in Influence Diagrams</br><br>Author: Barry Cobb, Assistant Professor, Virginia Military Institute, Department of Economics and Business, Lexington, VA, 24450, United States, cobbbr@vmi.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Two existing influence diagram (ID) models -- discrete ID’s and mixtures of truncated exponentials (MTE) ID’s -- are compared to an extension of MTE ID’s.  This new model -- the continuous decision MTE ID -- develops more precise decision strategies for continuous decision variables and marginalizes continuous decision variables from the model by replacing them with deterministic chance nodes.</br>
