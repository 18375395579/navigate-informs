        <br>Title: Probability and Time Trade-Off with Multiple Outcomes</br><br>Author: Alessandra Cillo, ACillo@iese.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Manel Baucells</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Previous work has introduced a preference model for simple lotteries in which both time and risk dimensions were fully integrated through the probability and time trade-off. In this paper we propose an extension of this work to multiple outcome lotteries with delay. Predictions in terms of risk attitude are also analyzed in the paper.</br>
