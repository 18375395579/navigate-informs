        <br>Title: Convex Optimization Methods for Understanding Customers Preferences and Recommending Products</br><br>Author: Theodoros Evgeniou, INSEAD, Bd de Constance, Fontainebleau, France, theodoros.evgeniou@insead.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present two methods for analyzing customer data using optimization and regularization theory. The first extracts a few product features that are important for all people. The second is a generalization of the first that also generalizes well-known methods for collaborative filtering for product recommendations. Experimental results and theoretical justifications show the potential, relative to state of the art methods, of regularization for parameter estimation using optimization techniques.</br>
