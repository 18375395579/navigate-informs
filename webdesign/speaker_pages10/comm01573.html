        <br>Title: Evaluating the Impact of Targets with Correlated Attributes on Ranking and Selection</br><br>Author: Douglas Morrice, Professor, University of Texas at Austin, 2110 Speedway Stop B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, douglas.morrice@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Butler, Jason Merrick</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Using constraints in multiattribute ranking and selection (R&S) is gaining popularity. Intuitively, a constraint will increase the variance of attribute score(s) and reduce the effectiveness of an R&S procedure.  Further, the increase in variance will be largest when a constraint is close to an attribute mean.  We derive the impact on R&S procedures when there are two correlated normally distributed performance measures for a variety of utility functions that capture the notion of a constraint.</br>
