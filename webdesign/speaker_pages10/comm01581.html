        <br>Title: Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) Process Monitoring using Evolutionary Clustering Analysis</br><br>Author: Omer Beyca, Research Assistant, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, 74074, United States of America, beyca@ostatemail.okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhenyu (James) Kong, Satish Bukkapatnam</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Process monitoring for Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) is extremely crucial to detect process defects and ensure high quality of polished wafers in semiconductor industry. It is challenging due to the non-linear and non-stationary nature. We proposed a novel Recurrent Nested Dirichlet Process (RNDP) model to tackle this challenge by dynamically constructing mixture of Gaussian distributions in a Markovian manner. Our case studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</br>
