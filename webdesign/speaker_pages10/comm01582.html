        <br>Title: Machine Learning for Power Grid Reliability: Predicting Manhole Events in New York</br><br>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 100 Main Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, rudin@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: I will present innovations in proactive power grid maintenance stemming from a collaboration between Columbia University and Con Edison, NYC’s power utility company. Specifically, I will describe the Manhole Events Project, where the goal is to predict electrical failures, including manhole fires and explosions in New York City. I will discuss the data mining process by which we transformed extremely raw historical data into a ranking model that predicts manhole vulnerability. Our ranked lists are currently assisting with the prioritization of future inspections and repairs in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx.</br>
