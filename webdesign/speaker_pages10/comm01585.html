Corporate ratings are based on the quantitative data and qualitative data that investors do not obtain it completely. In this paper we propose the method to evaluate the determinant structure of corporate ratings given by the above four agencies using a hierarchical type neural networks method with the quantitative data of Japanese companies only.</br>
