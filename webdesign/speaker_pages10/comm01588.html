        <br>Title: Risk Adjustment in Health Insurance</br><br>Author: Tengjiao Xiao, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, tex209@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aurelie Thiele</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper introduces robust optimization models to address uncertainty in risk adjustment, which is used to quantify payment transfers across health plans. We develop robust scoring mechanisms at both individual level and aggregate level, investigate the usefulness of having ranges of risk scores instead of a single risk score, and test the impact of the time horizons involved. Learning is also incorporated in the risk adjustment models as more information becomes available over time.</br>
