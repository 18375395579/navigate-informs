        <br>Title: A Context Dependent Model of Decision Making Under Risk</br><br>Author: Kanchan Mukherjee, PhD Candidate, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebelau, 77305, France, Kanchan.MUKHERJEE@insead.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes a context dependent model of decision making under risk where the valuation of a gamble depends not only on its own probability-outcome structure but also on the other gambles in the choice set. The model draws motivation from the range-frequency theory (Parducci, 1965), uses lesser number of parameters than CPT and explains a large number of empirical phenomena. The model can also predict how behavior patterns change with changes in specific parameters of a choice situation.</br>
