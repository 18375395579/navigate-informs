        <br>Title: Efficient Rare-event Simulation for Portfolios of Black-Scholes Assets</br><br>Author: Jose Blanchet, Columbia University, &#8207;500 W 120th St # 450, 3rd Floor, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, jose.blanchet@columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating large deviations probabilities of a portfolio of assets driven by correlated lognormals (including calls or basket options). We present several estimators that can be rigorously shown to be asymptotically optimal. Our estimators, based on importance sampling and conditional Monte Carlo, are easy to implement and robust even in the presence of many assets.</br>
