        <br>Title: Bayesian Analysis of Accelerated Life Tests with a Generalized Eyring Time Transformation Function</br><br>Author: Thomas Mazzuchi, Professor and Chair, George Washington University, 1776 GSt NW, Washington, DC, 20012, United States of America, mazzu@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Refik Soyer, Selda Kapan Ulusoy</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this article we perform a Bayesian analysis of accelerated life testing data with two stress variables using the generalized Eyring time transformation function. Selection and definition of the prior distributions will be developed as well as the areas for posterior analysis using MCMC methods.</br>
