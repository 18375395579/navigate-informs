        <br>Title: Large-scale Gaussian Process Calculation Without Matrix Factorizations</br><br>Author: Jie Chen, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S Ave Bldg 240, Argonne, IL, 60439, United States of America, jiechen@mcs.anl.gov</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Gaussian processes are the cornerstone of statistical analysis in many application areas. The calculation is often limited by its need to use the Cholesky factorization on the covariance matrix. We present a matrix-free framework for approximating likelihoods, and demonstrate several large-scale computation results. The favorable scaling of the results shows the usefulness of the framework that eliminates the reliance on matrix factorizations in Gaussian process computations.</br>
