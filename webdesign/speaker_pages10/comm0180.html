        <br>Title: Selecting Process Variables to Classify Production Batches into Two Classes</br><br>Author: Michel Anzanello, ISE-Rutgers University, 793 Bevier Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, michelja@eden.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Susan Albin, Art Chaovaitwongse</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Production data often consists of many, correlated, noisy process variables. Our objective is to select the important variables to classify batches into classes, e.g., premium and regular. Integrating PLS regression and data mining tools, we classify 5 real data sets and find the reduced set of variables yielding accurate classifications.</br>
