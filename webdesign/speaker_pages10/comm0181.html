        <br>Title: Estimating a Nonparametric Non Input Homothetic S-shaped Production Function</br><br>Author: Ole Olesen, Professor, University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, Odense M, DK-5230, Denmark, ole@sam.sdu.dk</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Ruggiero</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The use of the convex hull estimation in data envelopment analysis (DEA) models is often maintained, although standard microeconomic production theory posits a nonconvex S-shaped production frontier. Recently for an input homothetic production function a nonparametric estimation approach that allows for a nonconvex S-shaped scaling law has been proposed. In this paper we generalize this approach to allow for certain non input homothetic isoquants.</br>
