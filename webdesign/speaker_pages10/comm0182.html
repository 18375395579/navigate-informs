        <br>Title: Averaging Frameworks for Discrete Simulation Optimization</br><br>Author: Andrei Prudius, Ph.D Student, Georgia Tech., Stewart School of ISyE, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, aprudius@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present two frameworks for designing random search methods for discrete simulation optimization that allow the estimated  performance of each system to be the average of all observations collected at that system. The methods within our frameworks may use all available information to decide adaptively on how to expend simulation effort and are almost surely convergent. We also demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of averaging and adaptivity in context of the simulated annealing.</br>
