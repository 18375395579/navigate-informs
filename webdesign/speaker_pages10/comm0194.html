        <br>Title: A Dual-Response Approach to Robust Parameter Design for a Generalized Linear Model</br><br>Author: William Brenneman, Senior Statistician, The Procter & Gamble Company, 8700 Mason-Montgomery Road, Mason, OH, 45040, United States, brenneman.wa@pg.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Myers, Raymond Myers</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Robust Parameter Design has been studied and applied, in most cases, assuming a linear model under standard assumptions.  More recently, RPD has been considered in a generalized linear model (GLM) setting.  In this paper we apply a general dual response approach when using RPD in the case of a GLM.  We motivate the need for exploring both the process mean and process variance, by discussing situations when a compromise between the two is necessary.</br>
