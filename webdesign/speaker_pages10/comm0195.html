        <br>Title: Dynamically-Integrated Planning and Control for the Distributed Enterprise</br><br>Author: Young-Jun Son, Associate Professor, The University of Arizona, Systems and Industrial Engineering, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, son@sie.arizona.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a multi-scale federation of simulation and decision models that support planning and control with dynamic updating through sensed and streamed data.  Planning and control models are updated both from real-world sensed data and from simulations.  While the real world may yield parameters such as current costs or inventory status, the simulation model, in synchronization with other federates in the supply network, will be used to compute lead times and effective resource availabilities.</br>
