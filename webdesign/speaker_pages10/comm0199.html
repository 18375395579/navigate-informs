        <br>Title: A Supervised Learning Approach to Detect Threatening Cargo</br><br>Author: Chris Boner, Senior Manager, Metron, Inc., 11911 Freedom Dr, Suite 800, Reston, VA, 20190, boner@metsci.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper describes a supervised learning technique to (a) learn joint cargo feature values that are good discriminators between threat and non-threat cargo, and (b) to estimate a threat probability for each new cargo shipment based on its strongest threat indicator. This approach is implemented in Metron, Inc.’s Shipping Cargo Anomaly Detection and Classification (ScanDeck) technology and has demonstrated impressive detection performance during evaluations at Customs and Border Protection.</br>
