        <br>Title: Multiobjective Clustering with Metaheuristic Technology</br><br>Author: Manuel Laguna, Professor, University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business, 419 UCB, Boulder, CO, 80309, United States, laguna@colorado.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rafael Marti, Julian Molina, Rafael Caballero</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a metaheuristic procedure for multiobjective clustering problems. Our goal is to find good approximations of the efficient frontier and provide a means for improving decision making in multiple areas of application and in particular those related to marketing. Clustering using multiple criteria and/or multiple data sources has received limited attention in the literature. Our procedure is general and tackles several problems classes within this area of combinatorial data analysis.</br>
