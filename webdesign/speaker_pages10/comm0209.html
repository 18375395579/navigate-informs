        <br>Title: A Behavioral Measure of Risk</br><br>Author: Philippe Delqui? Associate Professor of Decision Sciences, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, F-77300, France, philippe.delquie@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alessandra Cillo</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a measure of risk based on the behavioral assumption that individuals care about differences among the outcomes of a gamble. This new risk measure includes variance as a special case, among many other forms.  It also leads to Rank-Dependent Utility and Disappointment models of choice.  We discuss properties of the risk measure.</br>
