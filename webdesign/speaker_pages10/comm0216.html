        <br>Title: A Classifier-Based Distance Metric for Ensemble Prediction</br><br>Author: Senay Yasar Saglam, PhD Candidate, The University of Iowa Dept. of Management Sciences, S210 John Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, IA, 52242-1000, United States of America, senay-yasarsaglam@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): W. Nick Street</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose methods of ensemble classification based on a new measure of distance between points. We map data points into a new space defined by the class probability estimates from a pool of two-class classifiers. Then, we use the Euclidean distance to measure the distance between data points in this space. We integrate this method with k-nearest neighbor procedures and KNORA in our experiments. Our findings show that our proposed method improves accuracy.</br>
