        <br>Title: Intertemporal Choice Under Timing Risk: An Experimental Approach</br><br>Author: Selcuk Onay, PhD Candidate, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, selcuk.onay@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ayse Onculer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Timing risk, that is, having more than one possible outcome realization time, is an inherent feature of many intertemporal decisions. In this paper, we take an experimental approach to study individuals?attitudes towards such risks and how this attitude relates to risk and time preferences. In contrast to predictions of the discounted utility models, our results show that individuals are averse to timing risk and that the main driver of this aversion is nothing but probabilistic risk aversion.</br>
