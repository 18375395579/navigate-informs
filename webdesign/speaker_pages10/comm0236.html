        <br>Title: Modeling Stochastic, State-Dependent Correlations</br><br>Author: Adam Metzler, Assistant Professor, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, ametzle@uwo.ca</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Empirical evidence indicates that financial assets tend to be most sensitive to systematic risk factors when these factors take on adverse values.  Unfortunately this relationship is not accounted for in many standard approaches to modeling stochastic correlation, most notably in simple mixture models.  In this talk we introduce a novel family of correlation models that explicitly accounts for this type of state-dependence, and contains both the simple mixture and RFL models as extreme cases.</br>
