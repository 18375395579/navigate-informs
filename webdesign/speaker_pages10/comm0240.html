        <br>Title: Supply Chain Progress Monitoring Based on Individualized Trace Data</br><br>Author: Jun Shu, Assistant Professor, Penn State, Department of Supply Chain and Informati, 462 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, junshu@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dr. Russell Barton</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Although quality control is widely used in manufacturing, its use in supply chains is practiced ad hoc, rather than rigorously defined using statistical characterizations.  We    develop a mathematical framework to represent and manipulate individualized trace data at multiple levels of aggregation. Using this framework, we propose several generic quality measures for the progress of entities through a supply chain and describe methods to monitor these measures.</br>
