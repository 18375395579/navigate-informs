        <br>Title: The Value of Stochastic Modeling in Two-stage Stochastic Programs</br><br>Author: Erick Delage, Assistant Professor, HEC Montréal, 3000 ch. de la Côte-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, Qc, H3T2A7, Canada, erick.delage@hec.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sharon Arroyo, Yinyu Ye</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Decisions often need to be made with incomplete knowledge about some parameters of the problem. While formulating a stochastic model that captures accurately this knowledge can be a costly task, solving a stochastic program simply based on historical data can provide useful guidance. Unfortunately, one might worry of being misled by such a simplistic view. In this work, we propose tractable methods for bounding the improvements that could be achieved with a more accurate/expensive model.</br>
