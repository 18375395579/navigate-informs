        <br>Title: G-Selc: Optimization by Sequential Elimination Using Genetic Algorithms and Gaussian Processes</br><br>Author: C. F. Jeff Wu, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Fest Dr. NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, jeffwu@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Sequential Elimination of Level Combinations (SELC) algorithm by Mandal, Wu and Johnson (2006), though powerful, fails to extract substantial information from the data to guide the search efficiently as it is not based on statistical modeling. The proposed approach uses Gaussian Process modeling to improve upon SELC. Its performance is illustrated using test functions and on a real pharmaceutical data set for finding a group of chemical compounds with optimal properties.</br>
