        <br>Title: A Continuous Time Stochastic Model for Spread-price Dynamics in Order-driven Markets</br><br>Author: Xinyun Chen, Columbia University, Room 323 Mudd Building, 500 West 120th Street, New York, United States of America, xc2177@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jose Blanchet</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We construct and study a continuous time model that incorporates the whole limit order book to inform the joint evolution of the spread and the price processes. The construction of our model is guided by empirical data. In particular, empirical observations suggest a multi-scale asymptotic regime, under which we obtain a  jump-diffusion processes governing the evolution of the spread-price dynamics. The simulation results reproduce stylized features observed empirically.</br>
