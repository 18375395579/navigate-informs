        <br>Title: Improving Collaborating Filtering Using Aggregate Ratings</br><br>Author: Akhmed Umyarov, New York University. Stern School of Business., 44 W 4TH ST #8-185, New York, NY, United States of America, akhmed.umyarov@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Tuzhilin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This talk describes a method of how external aggregate ratings data can be used for improving estimations of individual ratings for a certain class of existing collaborative filtering methods. E.g., can the aggregate movie ratings data from the IMDB database improve estimations of individual Netflix ratings using collaborative filtering? We show both theoretically and empirically that this external aggregate ratings data helps to improve performance of these collaborative filtering methods.</br>
