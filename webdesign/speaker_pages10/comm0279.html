        <br>Title: Evaluation of  Batched Quantile Estimation Merhods</br><br>Author: Dave Goldsman, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of ISYE, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, sman@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christos Alexopoulos, James Wilson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the performance of asymptotically valid confidence intervals (CIs) methods for steady-state quantiles computed from nonoverlapping  batches. Our results form the basis for the development of fully sequential procedures that yield CI estimators of steady-state quantiles with user-specified absolute or relative precision.</br>
