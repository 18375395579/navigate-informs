        <br>Title: Technical Efficiency of Jute Farmers in Bangladesh</br><br>Author: Subir Bairagi, PhD Student, University of Nebraska Lincoln, 314E Filley Hall, Lincoln, NE, 68583, United States of America, subirkanti105@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Uttam Deb</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Technical efficiency of 259 Jute farmers in Bangladesh is measured using a non-parametric approach (O'Donnell index). Single output and four inputs are used, gathered from CPD field survey. The result shows that the mean efficiency is about 0.54. In the 2nd stage, a Tobit model will be used to identify the factors responsible for technical inefficiency in jute farming in Bangladesh.</br>
