        <br>Title: Automatic Detection of Influenza Reassortments</br><br>Author: Carl Kingsford, Assistant Professor, University of Maryland, College Park, Department of Computer Science, 3113 Biomolecular Sciences Bldg #296, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, carlk@cs.umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: When a single host is infected by two strains of influenza simultaneously, the  genomes of the progeny viruses can be a mixture of those strains.  We present a  novel framework for comparing weighted ensembles of phylogenetic trees to  detect such reassortment events. The method accounts for uncertainty in the  phylogenetic reconstructions when detecting disagreements between the trees for  different influenza segments by reducing the problem to finding maximum and  maximal bicliques.</br>
