        <br>Title: Variance Swaps on Levy Subordinated Diffusions</br><br>Author: Matthew Lorig, Postdoctoral Researcher, Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering, Princeton University, Sherrerd Hall, Charlton Street, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, mlorig@princeton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rafael Mendoza</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We compute the value of a variance swap when the underlying is modeled as a Levy subordinated diffusion process.  The underlying in this framework may exhibit jumps with a state-dependent Levy measure, as well as local stochastic volatility and default intensity.  Moreover, the Levy subordinator can be obtained directly from European call/put prices.</br>
