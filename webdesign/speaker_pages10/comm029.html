        <br>Title: Rank-based Sensitivity Analysis of Multiattribute Value Models</br><br>Author: Antti Punkka, Researcher, TKK, Otakaari 1 M, Espoo, 02150, Finland, antti.punkka@tkk.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ahti Salo</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We extend methods for multi-way sensitivity analysis of multiattribute value models by examining what rankings the alternatives can attain subject to incomplete information about attribute weights and alternatives' scores. These rankings - which complement other sensitivity results such as value intervals and dominance relationships - are computed from an MILP model that allows hundreds of alternatives to be analyzed efficiently. Numerical examples with university rankings are given.</br>
