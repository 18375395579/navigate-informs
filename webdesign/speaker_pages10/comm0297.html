        <br>Title: Data-fusion in Solar Energy Prediction: An Overview and Modification of Perez Model</br><br>Author: Heng Su, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, hsu31@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Wu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: For planning building energy consumption, it is crucial to have a good prediction of solar irradiation. Current practice in predicting solar irradiance on tilt surfaces is to use a model due to Perez (1991) using a simplified geometrical representation of the sky dome. In our work, the potential bias of this model is investigated using statistical methods, and a simple and effective calibration to correct the bias is given as well.</br>
