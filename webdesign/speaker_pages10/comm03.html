        <br>Title: Stochastic Kriging for Simulation Metamodeling</br><br>Author: Bruce Ankenman, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, Dept. of Ind. Eng., 2145 Sheridan Rd., Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, ankenman@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Barry L Nelson, Jeremy Staum</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We extend the theory of kriging, as applied to the design and analysis of computer experiments, to a stochastic simulation setting.  Kriging provides a flexible response surface which can fit an underlying surface well even if no structure is known.  This expanded version of kriging allows us to characterize the uncertainty in the response surface estimation and the variability inherent in the simulation itself.  We discuss the analysis and implications on sequential design of the experiment.</br>
