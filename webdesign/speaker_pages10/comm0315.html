        <br>Title: Dynamic Bayesian Information Measures for Duration Analysis</br><br>Author: Ehsan Soofi, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Lubar School of Business, PO Box 742, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States, esoofi@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nader Ebrahimi, S.N.U.A. Kirmani</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present measures of information about the parameters provided by observation from the residual life distribution where the support is truncated at the current age. The current age induces a dynamic into the information measures. Dynamic versions of well-known measures of information provided by the data about parameters are studied. These measures are applied to dynamic updating of information about parameters and predictive distributions for some well-known lifetime models.</br>
