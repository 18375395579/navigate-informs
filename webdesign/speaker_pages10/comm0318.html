        <br>Title: Features Selection via the Minimization of Misclassification Probabilities of Discriminant Functions</br><br>Author: Rene Villalobos, Associate Professor, Arizona State University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States, rene.villalobos@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hugo Garcia</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this presentation we discuss a novel approach for feature and sensor selection. This approach uses a normal approximation of the exact misclassification probabilities from linear and quadratic discriminant functions as a way to identify the subset of features/sensors that render the lowest misclassification rate. Our approach differs from other methods in two ways: the selection is based on the minimization of the probability of error and it is designed to optimize these particular functions.</br>
