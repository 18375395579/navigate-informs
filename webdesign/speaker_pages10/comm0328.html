        <br>Title: Convergence Properties of Truncated Markov Decision Processes with Unbounded Jump Rates</br><br>Author: Flora Spieksma, Leiden University, Mathematical Institute, Niels Bohrweg 1, Leiden, 2333, Netherlands, spieksma@math.leidenuniv.nl</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Modern queueing applications require allowing the jump rates to be unbounded. This  yields a non-uniformisable MDP, to which value iteration cannot be applied.    Truncation methods have to be applied, but these generally destroy structural properties.  Our new method smoothed rate truncation however preserves these.  We discuss conditions under which optimal strategies for the truncated model converge  to an optimal strategy for the original model. We illustrate this with a webfarm application.</br>
