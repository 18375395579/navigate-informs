        <br>Title: Automatic Feature Selection for Unsupervised Clustering of Cycle-Based Signals</br><br>Author: Shiyu Zhou, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, szhou@engr.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A cycle-based signal refers to an analog or digital signal that is obtained during each repetition of operation cycles in a manufacturing process.  Different from the available supervised classification approaches that depend heavily on the training dataset or the engineering field knowledge, this paper aims to developing an automatic feature selection method for unsupervised clustering of cycle-based signals. The technique is a data pre-processing technique for process monitoring and diagnosis.</br>
