        <br>Title: Software Architecture, Algorithms, and Data Models for Radiotherapy OptimAl Design (RAD) - Part II</br><br>Author: Paul Uhlig, Associate Professor of Mathematics, St. Mary's University, One Camino Santa Maria, Dept. of Mathematics, San Antonio, TX, 78228-8560, United States, puhlig@stmarytx.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Allen Holder, Arthur Hanna</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Radiotherapy optimAl Design (RAD) is an academic radiotherapy treatment planning system.  RAD uses a database which stores the necessary anatomical data in RTOG format. That data is processed into a computer model that is used in the design and optimization stage.  This processing includes curve fitting for boundaries of tissues of varying types, labeling of regions, and efficient storage of the model.  This presentation outlines these processes that create the model.</br>
