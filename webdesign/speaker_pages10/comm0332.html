        <br>Title: Value of Information in a Competitive Game</br><br>Author: Josh Helms, Probability and Statistics Course Director, Department of Mathematical Sciences, United States Military Academy, 646 Swift Road, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, josh.helms@usma.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Scott Provan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop concepts related to modeling the acquisition and use of information in a simple matrix game. We apply this model to a battlefield game to measure effective game values. The results show that there is value in the information gained by partitioning the matrix game based on information sets and more finely partitioned information sets provide more valuable information.
