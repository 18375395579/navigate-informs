        <br>Title: Is It Better to Average Probabilities or Quantiles?</br><br>Author: Casey Lichtendahl, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia, Darden School of Business, 100 Darden Blvd, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States of America, lichtendahlc@darden.virginia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yael Grushka-Cockayne, Robert L. Winkler</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider two ways to aggregate expert opinions: the average probability forecast and the average quantile forecast. We examine several analytical properties of these forecasts and compare their ability to harness the wisdom of the crowd. We show that the two average forecasts have the same mean and that the average quantile forecast always has lower variance. We present empirical evidence that the average quantile forecast outperforms the average probability forecast on four scoring rules.</br>
