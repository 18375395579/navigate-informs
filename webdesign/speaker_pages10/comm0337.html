        <br>Title: Affine Point Processes for Multi-Name Credit</br><br>Author: Kay Giesecke, Assistant Professor, Management Science & Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, giesecke@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The value of any credit derivative is a function of market wide risk factors generated by the complex web of relationships in the economy. To incorporate these factors, we value credit derivatives from the top down by modeling the dynamics of aggregate losses directly. We make this approach computationally tractable within the affine point process framework. Affine point processes account for both cyclical dependence and contagion. They support Fourier transform based pricing and implementation.</br>
