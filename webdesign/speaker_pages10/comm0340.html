        <br>Title: Estimating Cargo Airdrop Collateral Damage Risk</br><br>Author: Jeffery Cochran, Professor of Operations Research, Air Force Institute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433, United States of America, jeffery.cochran@afit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vincent Cammarano</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: From real world airdrop scoring data we determine critical factors that affect supply airdrop error and find that bivariate normal distributions characterize cargo airdrop error patterns.  Collateral damage risk is estimated by combining numerical integrations of fit bivariate normal distributions across rectangular representations of drop field objects impacted by bundled airdrops as they fall along a linear path.</br>
