        <br>Title: Quantum Dynamic Programming Using Hybrid Automata</br><br>Author: Wolf Kohn, CTO and Founder, Clearsight Systems, 12828 Northup Way, Suite 310, Bellevue, WA, 98005, United States, wolf.kohn@clearsightsystems.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zelda Zabinsky</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe early results about implementing dynamic decision processes using quantum reasoning techniques. The processes are represented by hybrid automata. The reasoning techniques use quantum observables as inference operators. These operators are the edges of an automaton whose states are quantum states of the decision process. We provide several examples, such as inventory, replenishment management, resource scheduling and dispatch, using this paradigm.</br>
