        <br>Title: Gaussian Process modeling of big datasets</br><br>Author: Sam Tajbakhsh, PhD Student, The Pennsylvania State University, 801 W AARON DR APT A5, STATE COLLEGE, PA, 16803, United States of America, sdt144@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Enrique Del Castillo</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GP) have been widely used to model spatial data which are continuous in nature. Recent advancements in remote sensing technologies make abundant data available for analysis. However, the large size of the observed data poses computational challenges in matrix operations using the GP prediction model. In this work, we use multi-resolution basis functions to project the spatial process onto a lower dimension subspace to ease the computational effort of the predictive process.</br>
