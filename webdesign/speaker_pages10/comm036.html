        <br>Title: Robust Low-rank Tensor Recovery via Convex Optimization</br><br>Author: Zhiwei Qin, Columbia University, Room 313, 500 W. 120th St., New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, zq2107@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Donald Goldfarb</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recovering low-rank tensors from gross corruptions and missing values is important for multilinear data analysis.  We study the problem of robust low-rank tensor recovery in a convex optimization framework, and we propose efficient algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers and the accelerated proximal gradient method.  The practical effectiveness of the model and the algorithms is demonstrated through a series of synthetic and real examples.</br>
