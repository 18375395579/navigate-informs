        <br>Title: Fault Diagnosis for Partially Diagnosable Assembly Processes</br><br>Author: Zhenyu (James) Kong, Assistant Professor, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, james.kong@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wenzhen Huang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The identification of process related faults that cause large variations of KPC is one of the most critical research topics in dimensional control. Most of methods in literature assume that the process is fully diagnosable. However, in real applications, this assumption may not hold. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a clustering method for process diagnosability study, based on which a method is developed to conduct fault diagnosis for partially diagnosable assembly processes.</br>
