        <br>Title: Short Sales and Derivatives in Log-Robust Portfolio Management</br><br>Author: Aurelie Thiele, P.C. Rossin Asst Professor, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, aurelie.thiele@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ban Kawas</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We incorporate short sales and derivatives to our recently developed log-robust optimization model, where the uncertainty is on the continuously compounded rates of return - in line with the traditional Lognormal model - but probability distributions are not known. We develop heuristics and present insights into the structure of the optimal policy as well as numerical results.</br>
