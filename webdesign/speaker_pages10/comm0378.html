        <br>Title: Various Atypical Heterogeneous Structures for SIR Models</br><br>Author: Benjamin Morin, Postdoctoral Researcher, Arizona State University, School of Life Sciences, Box 874501, Tempe, AZ, 85287-4501, United States of America, brmorin@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Charles Perrings, Eli Fenichel, Carlos Castillo-Chavez</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: SIR models that account for distributed susceptibility, adaptive contact/mixing rates, and affinity are studied. We highlight the use of a variety of techniques in the modeling heterogeneities within an SIR context.  Model outcomes are evaluated under random mixing and alternative forms of heterogeneity: qualitative equivalence, relative disease severity, and tractability.</br>
