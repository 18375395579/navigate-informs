        <br>Title: Statistical Updating of Finite Element Model with Lamb Wave Sensing Data for Structural Damage Detection</br><br>Author: Arda Vanli, College of Engineering, Florida State University, 2525 Pottsdamer St., Tallahassee, FL, 32310, United States of America, avanli@fsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sungmoon Jung</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This study proposes a new probabilistic model updating method used to improve the prediction capability of a finite element analysis (FEA) model of structural damages with experimental observations from a sensor network. A controlled damage experiment on a composite panel showed that the proposed model updating approach achieves a prediction accuracy that is superior to existing calibration approaches.</br>
