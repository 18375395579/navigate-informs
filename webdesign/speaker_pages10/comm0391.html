        <br>Title: How Much of the Gini is Due to Segmentation?</br><br>Author: Lyn Thomas, Professor of Management Science, School of Management, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1 BJ, United Kingdom, L.Thomas@soton.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Credit scoring systems are measured in many ways - predictive ability, power of discrimination, and accuracy of calibration. In practice a scoring system will consist of a number of scorecards - one for each subpopulation - and of vital importance is the overall ROC curve and Gini coefficient when the scorecards are combined. Part of this discrimination is due to choice of segments. This talk outlines an easily calculated bound on how much of the discrimination is due to the segmentation.</br>
