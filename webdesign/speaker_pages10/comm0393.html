        <br>Title: On the Monotonicity of Value of Information with Risk Aversion in Two-Action Decision Problems</br><br>Author: Zhengwei Sun, Post-doctoral Research Associate, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Ave., Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, zsun4@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ali Abbas</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper analyses the monotonicity of the value of information with risk aversion in two-action decision problems when the decision makers have uncertain initial wealth. We demonstrate that there is no general monotonicity between information value and the risk aversion function in this setting by two numeric examples. We then show that monotonicity exists with Rubinstein's measure or Ross's measure of risk aversion with some regulatory conditions.</br>
