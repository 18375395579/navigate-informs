        <br>Title: Time Changed Markov Processes in Credit Risk Modeling</br><br>Author: Vadim Linetsky, Professor, Northwestern University, IEMS, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60202, United States, linetsky@iems.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a rich class of analytically tractable models for the defaultable stock price that may include diffusion, jumps, stochastic volatility, and jump to default. The construction is based on time changing Markov processes with known spectral expansions of the transition semigroup.</br>
