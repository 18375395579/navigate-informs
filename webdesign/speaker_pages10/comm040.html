        <br>Title: An Interactive Algorithm for Multi-objective Integer Programs</br><br>Author: Jyrki Wallenius, Aalto University School of Business, Runebergink. 14-16, Helsinki, Finland, jyrki.wallenius@aalto.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Murat Koksalan, Pekka Korhonen, Banu Lokman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop an interactive algorithm for multi-objective integer programs under an underlying quasiconcave value function. We generate constraints to eliminate inferior regions with respect to the convex cones derived from past preferences. We also develop a variation that approximates the most preferred solution with a desired level of accuracy. Our computational results show that it performs well in terms of the solution quality, solution time, and required preference information.</br>
