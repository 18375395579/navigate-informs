        <br>Title: Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons</br><br>Author: Sewoong Oh, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States of America, swoh@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Devavrat Shah, Sahand Negahban</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The question of aggregating pair-wise comparisons to obtain a global ranking over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it ranking of online gamers and chess players or aggregating social opinions. In most settings, in addition to obtaining ranking, finding ‘scores?for each object is of interest for understanding the intensity of the preferences. We propose an iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects from pairwise comparisons.</br>
