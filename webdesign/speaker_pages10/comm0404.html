        <br>Title: Transform Formulae for Linear Functionals of Affine Processes and their Bridges on PSD</br><br>Author: Wanmo Kang, Assistant Professor, KAIST, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of, wanmo.kang@kaist.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chulmin Kang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We derive transform formulae for linear functionals of affine processes and their bridges whose state space is a set of positive semidefinite matrices. We investigate the relationship between such transforms and certain integral equations. Our findings extend and unify the existing results on affine processes and squared Bessel functionals, respectively. We also derive analytic expressions for Laplace transforms of some functionals of Wishart bridges. This is a joint work with Chulmin Kang.</br>
