        <br>Title: Non-Parametric Scan Statistics for Event Detection in Heterogeneous Social Media Graphs</br><br>Author: Feng Chen, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Carnegie Mellon University, 5308 Beelermont Place, Pittsburgh, PA, 15217, United States of America, fchen1@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel B. Neill</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Event detection in social media is an important but challenging problem. Existing approaches focus on burst detection, topic modeling, or clustering techniques, which cannot model the heterogeneous network structure in social media. This paper converts the network in to a “sensor?network, proposes non-parametric scan statistics to model the heterogeneity, and develops efficient non-parametric scanning algorithms for event detection. Validations were conducted on real-life twitter data sets.</br>
