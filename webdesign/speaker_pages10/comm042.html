        <br>Title: Secondary Structure Prediction in Proteins with a New Dihedral Angle Measure</br><br>Author: Jim MacGregor-Smith, Professor, Dept of Mechanical and Industrial Eng., Elab Building, Univ of Massachusetts, 160 Govenor's Drive, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, jmsmith@ecs.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Moon Kim, Yunho Jang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Secondary structure prediction in proteins is a necessary  prerequisite for tertiary prediction in the protein folding  process. Based upon the combinatorial optimization properties of Steiner trees, a new dihedral angle measure is derived to aid in this  process. Numerous experimental results with this new angle measure  and its probability distribution  are presented in order to characterize the alpha-helix and beta-sheet structures of proteins.</br>
