        <br>Title: A Careful Look at Criterion Importance and Weights</br><br>Author: Pekka Korhonen, Professor, Aalto University, School of Economics, Helsinki, 00100, Finland, pekka.korhonen@aalto.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jyrki Wallenius, Kari Silvennoinen, Anssi Öörni</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the connection between announced importance of criteria and weights, when a linear value function is assumed to represent DM’s preferences. Based on an experimental setting, we use the subjects?responses to estimate the weights for the criteria in the linear value function. The value function explains choices very well, but our results imply that there is a reason to question the common belief that the values of the weights would reflect the importance of criteria.</br>
