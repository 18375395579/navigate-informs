        <br>Title: Pareto Set Estimation Using Ranking and Selection</br><br>Author: Judy Lee, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, jlee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the ranking and selection problem with multiple objectives and present an algorithm to estimate a Pareto set. We provide three different formulations, i.e., retaining all the desirable and eliminating all the undesirable systems, or achieving either one of the two aforementioned goals. In each case, we identify appropriate choices of parameter values and prove that the resulting algorithm guarantees the desired probability of correct selection.</br>
