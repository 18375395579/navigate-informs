        <br>Title: Graph-Theoretical Approach to the Study of Abnormal Brain Network</br><br>Author: W. Art Chaovalitwongse, Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, wchaoval@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wichai Suharitdamrong, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The investigation of brain synchronization with application in epilepsy has raised many research challenges in optimization, due to a large number of combinations among electrodes which exponentially increases with the number of electrodes. It is difficult to visualize specific coupling patterns from each individual group of electrodes. We will present a brain similarity network (BSN), derived from a graph-theoretical approach, to investigate natural clusters of the brain network.</br>
