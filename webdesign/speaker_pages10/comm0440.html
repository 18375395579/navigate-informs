        <br>Title: Modeling, Grouping, and Monitoring of Nonlinear and Spatiotemporal Profiles</br><br>Author: Gang Liu, University of South Florida, 4202 E Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, gliu@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Yang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Recently, we developed a multiscale basis function model to characterize the spatiotemporal signals from complex systems. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm that clusters model parameters into minimally redundant groups. This addresses multi-collinear effects in the large sets of features extracted from model parameters. In addition, we develop a new group feature selection method that eliminates unimportant groups and selects the most informative features for performance monitoring.</br>
