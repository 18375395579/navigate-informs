        <br>Title: Data Fusion in Bio-Manufacturing and Soft Tissue Expansion Processes for Bio-Medical Applications</br><br>Author: Xiaofeng Qin, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, xqin2@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuan-Shin Lee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents the investigation of soft tissue expansion process for biomedical devices development and bio-manufacturing.  The objective of the investigation is to describe the expansion as a manufacturing process with sufficient specifications, such that the process is reproducible within a given tolerance. This paper examines how collagen-based, soft tissue responds to mechanical deformation and the effects of different process parameters.</br>
