        <br>Title: Population Model-based Optimization</br><br>Author: Xi Chen, PhD student, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 205 Transportation Bldg.,, 104 S.

To better capture the multi-modality of the objective functions than traditional model-based methods which use only a single model, we propose a framework of using a population of models with an adaptive mechanism to propagate the population. The mechanism is derived from estimating the optimal parameter of the model in a Bayesian manner, which provides a proper way to determine the diversity of the models.</br>
