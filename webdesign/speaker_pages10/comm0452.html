        <br>Title: Value Function Scales Problems in MCDM Portfolio Analysis</br><br>Author: Adiel Almeida, Prof, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Cx.

Two aggregating methods are considered: additive method and an outranking method, which uses a non-compensatory rationality, while the former corresponds to a compensatory one. Problems related to scales used for intra-criteria evaluation are considered, which is linked to inter-criteria elicitation in the case of additive methods.</br>
