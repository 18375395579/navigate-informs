        <br>Title: Understanding the Instruments of National Power through a System of Differential Equations</br><br>Author: Cade Saie, Air Force Institute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way, WPAFB, OH, 45433, United States of America, Cade.Saie@afit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Darryl Ahner</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by the modeling of attrition warfare using Lanchester equations, we develop of a functional form of a system of differential equations; describe the methodology which populates and solves this system; and demonstrate the results obtained through an application of the process using open source data from Iraq.  This system captures the changes in measures of merit used to evaluate the effects of leveraging the instruments of national power in nation-building operations.</br>
