        <br>Title: Length Bias in the Measurements of Carbon Nanotubes</br><br>Author: Paul Kvam, Professor, Georgia Tech, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, pkvam@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator is constructed for the length distribution of carbon nanotubes, whose lengths are measured by atomic force microscopy on a square grid and nanotubes crossing the grid are not included. Consequences of the length bias arising are examined using a generalization of Buffon's needle problem. The corrected length distribution provides a better fit to the Weibull distribution than the original selection biased observations.</br>
