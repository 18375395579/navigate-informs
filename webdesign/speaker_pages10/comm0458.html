        <br>Title: Cooperative Surrogate Models Improving Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms</br><br>Author: Saúl Zapotecas Martínez, CINVESTAV-IPN, MEXICO, D.F., Mexico, saul.zapotecas@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Carlos A. Coello Coello</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) assisted by two different meta-models: a local and a global one. The global model is constructed by using different surrogate models. The local model is generated by using the solutions in the current population of the MOEA. The training set for each model is updated along the search of the MOEA. The two different predicted values of the functions provided by the meta-models are used to estimate the final value of each function.</br>
