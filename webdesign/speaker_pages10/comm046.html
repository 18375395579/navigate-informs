        <br>Title: Scaling Response Parameters: A Multivariate Probit Approach</br><br>Author: Sri Duvvuri, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, S348 PBB, Iowa City, IA, 52245, United States of America, sri-duvvuri@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Minakshi Trivedi, Karthik Sridhar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This research compares consumer response parameters across categories and different regions.  In specifying random coefficient choice models, the variation in the mean responses is taken into account while the variation in the variances is ignored. Recently, studies have explored the implications of this assumption and point out that a comparison of estimated parameters across segments and/or data sets might confound the results.  We investigate these issues using a multivariate probit model.</br>
