        <br>Title: Gaussian Process Modeling for Measurement and Verification of Building Energy Savings</br><br>Author: Yeonsook Heo, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S. Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL, United States of America, yheo@anl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diane Graziano, Victor Zavala</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Measurement and verification (M&V) can add significant cost to building energy efficiency projects and often produce energy savings evaluations that lack credibility.  We introduce an improved M&V method applying Gaussian Process (GP) modeling that can, using less measured data, capture nonlinear energy behavior and quantify prediction uncertainty.  A case study demonstrates the strengths of GP models for M&V and further explores their potential for analyzing different time resolution data.</br>
