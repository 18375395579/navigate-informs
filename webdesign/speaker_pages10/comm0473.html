        <br>Title: Probabilistic Index Maps: Capturing Structure of Natural Signals by Mining Their Self-similarity</br><br>Author: Nebojsa Jojic, Senior Researcher, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, United States, jojic@microsoft.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: One of the problems in modeling natural signals is that signals with very similar structure  may locally have completely different measurements, e.g., images taken under different illumination conditions, or the speech signal captured in different environments. Rather than modeling a signal as an array or a matrix of local measurements, I will argue that interesting structure in signals is better captured when the signal is defined as a matrix whose entries are discrete indices to a separate palette of possible measurements.</br>
