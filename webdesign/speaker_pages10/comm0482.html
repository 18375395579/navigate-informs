        <br>Title: Inferring Competitive Measures on the Web from Aggregate Usage Data</br><br>Author: Zhiqiang (Eric) Zheng, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Dallas, School of Management, SM33, Richardson, TX, 75083-0688, United States, ericz@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Balaji Padmanabhan, Peter Fader</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we present methods for learning various competitive measures such as market share for electronic commerce. Rather than estimating these numbers from detailed customer level Web browsing data, the methods presented here derive the measures from simple aggregate data that is assumed to be available freely. Based on data from ComScore we show empirically that our methods perform well in inferring key diagnostic measures such as market share and share of requirement.</br>
