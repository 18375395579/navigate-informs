        <br>Title: When Quantity Matters: A Multivariate Tobit Model</br><br>Author: Sri Duvvuri, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, S348 PBB, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, sri-duvvuri@uiowa.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Integrating quantity decisions into the choice framework is essential to overcome the selectivity bias and infer consumer behavior more accurately.  We propose a multivariate tobit model that simultaneously accounts for purchase incidence and quantity decisions of consumers across multiple categories.  We estimate a Hierarchical Bayes econometric specification of this complex model using MCMC methods.  Scanner panel data across several categories are used for model calibration.</br>
