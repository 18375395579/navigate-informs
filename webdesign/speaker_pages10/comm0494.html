        <br>Title: Weakly Cooperative Systems</br><br>Author: David Jeffcoat, Principal Engineer, Air Force Research Lab, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Eglin AFB, FL, 32542, United States of America, david.jeffcoat@eglin.af.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pavlo Krokhmal</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a concept of weakly cooperative systems that can represent a wide range of multi-agent systems.  Our mathematical model is the Markov process.  We present a general framework and illustrate it on a number of search and engage systems.  Our analysis shows that the impact of cooperation on overall system performance is inherently bounded.  Finally, we introduce a measure of cooperation that enables one to quantify the “degree of cooperativeness?in a given multi-agent system.</br>
