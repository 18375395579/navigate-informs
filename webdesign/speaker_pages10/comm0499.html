        <br>Title: Higher Moment Coherent Risk Measures</br><br>Author: Paul Krokhmal, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, 2403 Seamans Center, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, krokhmal@engineering.uiowa.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We discuss modeling of risk-averse preferences in stochastic programming problems using risk measures. By developing simple representations that express risk measures via specially constructed stochastic programming problems, we introduce a new family of higher-moment coherent risk measures (HMCR). It is demonstrated that the HMCR measures are SSD-compatible, can be efficiently implemented in stochastic optimization models, and perform well in portfolio optimization case studies.</br>
