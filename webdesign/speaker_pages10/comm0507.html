        <br>Title: New Techniques for Sensitivty Analysis in Multi-objective Decision Analyisis Models</br><br>Author: Jeff Weir, Air Force Institute of Technology, 2950 Hobson Way, WPAFB, OH, 45433, United States of America, jeffery.weir@afit.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Although a wide variety of sensitivity analysis methods for additive value models appear in the literature, the most commonly used and easily understood is one-way sensitivity analysis. We present two new methodologies, one for one-way and one for n-way sensitivity analysis that address concerns from practice with traditional methods  and allow decision makers to quickly investigate how the rank order of alternatives and their values change across the entire feasible region of a weight space.</br>
