        <br>Title: Mean-Risk Models Using Two Risk Measures: A Multi-Objective Approach</br><br>Author: Gautam Mitra, Professor, CARISMA, Brunel University, School of Mathematical Sciences, John Crank Building, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UB8 3PH, United Kingdom, gautam.mitra@brunel.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ken Darby-Dowman, Diana Roman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a model for portfolio optimization in which distributions are described and compared using three statistics: mean, variance and CVaR at a specified confidence level. The purpose is to improve on mean-variance and mean-CVaR efficient solutions. The problem is multi-objective and transformed into a single objective problem. In the case of scenario models, the problem is a quadratic program. The model is tested on real data drawn from the FTSE 100 index.</br>
