        <br>Title: An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to Sponsored Search</br><br>Author: Andrew Mastin, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Room 32-D642, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, mastin@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell, Patrick Jaillet</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present an approximate dynamic programming algorithm for online advertisement allocation in sponsored search (frequently referred to as the Adwords problem). Using an approximation architecture based on piecewise linear separable value function approximations, we show empirical performance values greater than 99% of posterior solutions for problem instances where myopic polices are theoretically proven to perform poorly.  We also show experimental results based on real search engine data.</br>
