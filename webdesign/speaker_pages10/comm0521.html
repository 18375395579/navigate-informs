        <br>Title: Wavelet ANOVA for Detection of Local and Global Profile Changes</br><br>Author: Eric Chicken, Associate Professor, Florida State University, 117 N. Woodward Ave., P.O. Box 3064330, Tallahassee, FL, 32306-4330, United States of America, chicken@stat.fsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sentil Girimurugan, Jinfeng Zhang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Statistical functional data analysis has gained much attention recently due to significant increases in the volume of data collected.   We extend previous high dimensional methods to a generalized functional ANOVA method in the wavelet domain. We show that our statistic has improved power in detecting differences of small magnitudes due to the incorporation of dimension reduction via wavelet thresholding. Our method is evaluated via simulation and on real industrial and genetic data sets.</br>
