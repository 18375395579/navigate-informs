        <br>Title: In-situ Monitoring of Etching Processes of the Oxide Film Using Optical Emission Spectral Signals</br><br>Author: Myong K.

This paper proposes kernel based process modeling such as kernel partial least square regression for the etch rate and uniformity in plasma process. Based on the experimental results, we can conclude that in-situ OES data can be used to predict the performance of plasma etching process as well as detect fault patterns of the process via the kernel based modeling.</br>
