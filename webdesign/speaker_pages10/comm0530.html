        <br>Title: Poisson Disorder Problem with Phase-type Change Distributions</br><br>Author: Semih Sezer, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, sezer@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erhan Bayraktar</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the Poisson disorder problem where the arrival rate of a Poisson process changes suddenly at some unknown and unobservable time. The objective is to detect the change-time as quickly as possible. In this talk, we assume that the change-time has a phase-type distribution. We find an optimal stopping rule for this general case, and we give a numerical algorithm that approximates the value function of the problem with negligible error levels.</br>
