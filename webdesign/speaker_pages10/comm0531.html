        <br>Title: Occupation Times, Drawdowns and Drawups for One-dimensional Regular Diffusions</br><br>Author: Hongzhong Zhang, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, 928, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, hz2244@columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by the omega risk model, we consider a diffusion type, reduced form default model where the hazard rate depends on the level or the drawdown of the underling process, using which we calculate the probability of observing a large drawdown before the actual default occurs. The derivation is through computing a class of stopped occupation time formulas for regular diffusions.  Other applications of the result include pricing of Parisan-like and alpha-quantile options on the drawdown.</br>
