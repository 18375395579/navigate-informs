        <br>Title: Reliability of Nondestructive Evaluation for Aerospace Applications</br><br>Author: Jeremy Knopp, The Air Force Research Laboratory, 2230 Tenth Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433, United States of America, Jeremy.Knopp@wpafb.af.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Aldrin, Ramana Grandhi, Li Zeng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Reliability of Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) in the US Air Force and other industries is quantified by probability of detection (POD) studies.  The data can be collected as hit/miss or the response of an inspection instrument can be recorded. Recent efforts in model-assisted probability of detection (MAPOD) and advances in statistical analysis will be discussed.</br>
