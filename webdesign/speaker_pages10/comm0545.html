        <br>Title: Learning Risk Measures Through Inverse Optimization</br><br>Author: Vishal Gupta, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ORC, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, vgupta1@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dimitris Bertsimas</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Specifying risk preferences is critical in many applications.  Descriptions, like ``conservative'' or ``risky,'' are notoriously uninformative.  We take a data-driven perspective.  Using inverse optimization, we construct a coherent risk measure from an investor's historical holdings that approximately describes her behavior.  We illustrate our approach with a case study of US mutual funds, clustering funds by their fitted risk profiles and contrast to traditional Lipper ratings.</br>
