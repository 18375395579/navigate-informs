        <br>Title: Detectability Study for Statistical Monitoring of Multivariate Dynamic Processes</br><br>Author: Nan Chen, University of Wisconsin Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, nchen3@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shiyu Zhou</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this article, we propose an intrinsic definition of fault detectability in multivariate dynamic processes. Further, the relationship between the system structures and the detectability for both mean change fault and variability change fault are investigated. Analytical criteria for checking the system detectability are established. Our results can provide guidelines on system design improvement for process monitoring and control.</br>
