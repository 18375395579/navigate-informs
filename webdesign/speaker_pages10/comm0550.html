        <br>Title: Mining Data with Classification Trees, Discrete Optimization Models, and Sammon Maps</br><br>Author: Edward Wasil, Professor of Management Science, American University, Kogod School of Business, Washington, DC, 20016, United States, ewasil@american.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Golden, S. Raghavan, Zhiwei Fu, Shreevardhan Lele</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Over the last five years, we have developed several new methods that use ideas from statistics, heuristic search, and mathematical programming for solving a variety of data mining problems. First, we describe our innovative methods for constructing classification trees in very large data sets. Second, we focus on discrete optimization models in data visualization. Third, we describe our work on formulating visualization models that are based on adjacency data using Sammon maps.</br>
