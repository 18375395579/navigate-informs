        <br>Title: Optimal Survivor Search for Distressed Persons</br><br>Author: Lawrence Stone, CEO, Metron Inc, 11911 Freedom Dr, Suite 800, Reston, VA, 20190, United States of America, stone@metsci.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Traditional search plans seek to maximize probability of detection.  When searching for a distressed person in adverse circumstances, a more appropriate goal is to maximize the probability of detecting the person alive. This is called optimal survivor search.  If the search is for a person who may be in cold water or on a life raft, it is important to search the person-in-the-water scenario first without ignoring the life-raft scenario.  Optimal survivor search tells us where to search and for how long to maximize probability of detecting the person alive.</br>
