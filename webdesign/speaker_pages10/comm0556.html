        <br>Title: Error Equivalence Concept and Multistage Manufacturing Process Control</br><br>Author: Qiang Huang, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, huangq@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hui Wang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Error equivalence refers to the engineering phenomenon that different error sources result in identical variation patterns on product features. It presents challenging control issues to multistage manufacturing process. This paper modeled error equivalence by transforming all error sources into equivalent amount of base type error. The error equivalence model was then integrated into the description of variation propagation. The advantages of considering error equivalence were discussed.</br>
