        <br>Title: Model-based Multivariate Monitoring Charts for Autocorrelated Processes</br><br>Author: Xuan Huang, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, 121 Presidents Drive, Amherst, MA, 01002, United States of America, xuan@som.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Soren Bisgaard</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Autocorrelation may seriously impact the performance of conventional control charts. For univariate process, it has been proposed to use a special cause control chart on the residuals after fitting a time series model. We generalize this idea to multivariate scenario. We produce plot on fitted values to provide a guidance of process adjustments and propose applying the Hotellings T2 to the residuals after fitting a multivariate time series model. The Average Run Length performance is reported.</br>
