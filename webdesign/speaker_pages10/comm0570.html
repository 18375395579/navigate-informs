        <br>Title: Contour Estimation from Complex Computer Codes Using Sequential Design</br><br>Author: Pritam Ranjan, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC, V5A1S6, Canada, pritamr@cs.sfu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Derek Bingham, George Michailidis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In many engineering applications, one is interested in identifying the values of the inputs in computer experiments that leads to a response above a pre-specified threshold or, in a region of interest. In this talk we introduce statistical methodology that identifies the desired contour(s) in the input space. Application includes estimation of highest posterior density (HPD) region.</br>
