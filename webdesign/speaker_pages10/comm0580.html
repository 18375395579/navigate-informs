        <br>Title: Broaching Process Monitoring based on Global and Cyclic Signals</br><br>Author: Ran Jin, Virginia Tech, Grado Dept of Industrial and Systems, Engineering, 111 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, jran5@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wenmeng Tian, Tingting Huang, Jaime Camelio</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Broaching is a machining process to create specific shaped slots. Both global and local defects in manufacturing process may exhibit, while those defects are hard to be detected based on product quality or tool conditions in real practice. In this talk, we present a process monitoring framework for global and local defects based on pulling force signals. Both a simulation and a case study of broaching processes are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</br>
