        <br>Title: Time Series Search and Retrieval for Printer Diagnosis and Repair</br><br>Author: John Handley, Member of Research Staff, Xerox Corporation, 800 Phillips Road, MS 128 27E, Webster, NY, 14580, United States of America, john.handley@xerox.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sankar Virdhagriswaran</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Many printers are connected to the Internet and send time-dependent data comprising sensor values and usage statistics to a data warehouse. When diagnosing faults within a machine, service engineers find it valuable to plot a time series of a particular variable and search a database for machines with similar behavior.  We present a system for search and retrieval that uses global similarity based on dynamic time warping and local similarity based on a modified Smith-Waterman metric.</br>
