        <br>Title: Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Integrating Multi-resolution Data</br><br>Author: Haifeng Xia, Ph.D Candidate, Texas A&M, 238 Zachry, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77840, United States of America, haifeng_xia@neo.tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding, Bani Mallick</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a Bayesian hierarchical model for integrating multi-resolution data. It includes a Gaussian process to model low-resolution data and a neighborhood linkage model to bridge the multi-resolution datasets. The Bayesian hierarchical framework utilizes information at all the resolution levels and predicts better at locations where only low-resolution measurements are available or no measurements are available. Improvements are demonstrated using metrology datasets of two resolutions.</br>
