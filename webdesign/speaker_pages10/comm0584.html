        <br>Title: Analyzing Performance of Hedge Funds through a Learning-based Piecewise Method</br><br>Author: Fei Pan, Purdue University, Krannert School of Management, West Lafayette, 47906, United States, panfei@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng, Kwei Tang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Hedge funds as a unique asset class may use flexible strategies, leverage, and derivative securities that make performance measurement complex. In this paper, we apply a learn-based piecewise method to explain returns. Support vector machine clustering accomplishes the learning ability of this approach. Experimental results show this algorithm has more explanation power. Further, we apply this approach to investigate the relationship between fund size and returns and discover some novel results.</br>
