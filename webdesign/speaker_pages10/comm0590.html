        <br>Title: Optimal Design of Experiments for System Identification Applied to Transcriptional Network Modeling</br><br>Author: Cenny Taslim, Graduate Administrative Associate, The Ohio State University, 210 Baker Systems, 1971 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States, taslim.2@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Theodore Allen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: An approach based on systems theory and regression was proposed in Science for unraveling genomic transcription network rules.  We systematically study this approach and compare it with a proposed method in terms of correct inferences and accuracy of system resilience estimates derived.  Also, we suggest avenues for future research.</br>
