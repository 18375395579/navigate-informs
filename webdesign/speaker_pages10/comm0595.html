        <br>Title: Pricing Both Continuous and Discrete Asian Options under Markov Processes</br><br>Author: Ning Cai, Assistant Professor, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, ningcai@ust.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yingda Song, Steven Kou</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We derive analytical approximations to both continuous and discrete Asian option prices under general Markov processes. The convergences are justified rigorously. Numerical results illustrate that our pricing methods are accurate and fast under diffusion models, jump diffusion models, and pure jump models.</br>
