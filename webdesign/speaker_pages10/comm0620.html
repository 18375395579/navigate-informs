        <br>Title: Extensions to Oblivious Equilibrium</br><br>Author: Gabriel Weintraub, Columbia Business School, gweintraub@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): C. Lanier Benkard, Benjamin Van Roy</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Oblivious equilibrium (OE) is a new solution concept for approximating Markov perfect equilibrium in dynamic oligopoly models. In this talk we extend our base model, OE, and our algorithms to incorporate aggregate random shocks common to all firms. This extension is important when analyzing the dynamic effects of industry-wide business cycles and it further expands the set of dynamic industry models that can be analyzed computationally.</br>
