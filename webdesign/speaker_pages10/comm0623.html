        <br>Title: Process Monitoring of Airplane Parametric Data</br><br>Author: James Schimert, The Boeing Company, P.O. Box 3707 MC 7L-43, Seattle, WA, 98124, United States of America, James.Schimert@boeing.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Airplanes collect volumes of data from sensors on systems including flight control, hydraulic and electrical power.  When maintenance messages or flight deck effects occur, the airplane may be grounded.  Therefore it is of interest to anticipate these faults before they occur.  This talk discusses process monitoring techniques for this purpose, including a variety of practical issues involved in using independent components, setting limits using density estimation, and contribution plots.</br>
