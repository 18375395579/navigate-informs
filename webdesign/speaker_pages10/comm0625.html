        <br>Title: Aggregation of Activities and Inputs in Data Envelopment Analysis</br><br>Author: Endre Bjørndal, Associate Professor, NHH Norwegian School of Economics, Helleveien 30, Bergen, 5045, Norway, endre.bjorndal@nhh.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mette Bjørndal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the misspecification bias that arises from using a single DEA-model to evaluate activities that are in fact separable. The bias can be attributed to activity aggregation and input aggregation, respectively. The former effect is non-negative, whereas the latter, known in the literature as intra-input aggregation, is non-positive in the absence of allocative inefficiency. We demonstrate, using simulated data, the total effect of model misspecification on technical and cost efficiency.</br>
