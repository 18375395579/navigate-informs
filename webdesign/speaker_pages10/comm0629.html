        <br>Title: Averaging, Sampling, and Derivative Estimation within Stochastic Approximation Algorithms</br><br>Author: Raghu Pasupathy, Associate Professor, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, 24060, United States of America, pasupath@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fatemeh Hashemi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Despite stochastic approximation algorithms' enduring popularity for continuous simulation optimization, the prevailing opinion is that their finite-time performance can sometimes be poor. In a further attempt at alleviating this, we combine several ideas --- dynamic steps, Polyak-Ruppert averaging, and sampling --- within the iterative process. We characterize the resulting rates and discuss implementation.</br>
