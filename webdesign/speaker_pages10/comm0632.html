        <br>Title: Radiation Measurement and Contextual Data Fusion for Nuclear Analysis</br><br>Author: Simon Labov, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, PO Box 808, L-181, Livermore, CA, 94550, United States of America, slabov@llnl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Saswati Ray, Doug Speck, Karl Nelson, Michael Pivovaroff, Artur Dubrawski, Kelley Herndon Ford</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: One of the most critical challenges in national security is the detection of a nuclear or radiological weapon in the midst of common radioactive materials.  We are developing a unique approach that combines inputs from multiple radiation sensors with contextual information (e.g., location, manifest information, etc.). We use physics-based techniques to reduce the measurements and contextual information into a series of feature vectors, and machine learning algorithms to classify the incident.</br>
