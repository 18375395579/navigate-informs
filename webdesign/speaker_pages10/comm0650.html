        <br>Title: Variation Source Identification in Manufacturing Using Nonlinear Measurements</br><br>Author: Jean-Philippe Loose, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, United States, jploose@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shiyu Zhou, Darek Ceglarek</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a variation source identification procedure in the presence of nonlinear measurements, which refers to the measurements that are related with the process variation sources through a nonlinear function. In the proposed procedure, the joint probability density of the measurements is determined as a function of the process parameters; then, series of statistical tests are performed to identify the variation source. A case study is used to illustrate the procedure.</br>
