        <br>Title: Simulation of Extremes of a Gaussian Vector</br><br>Author: Ton Dieker, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, ton.dieker@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Yakir, Richard Birge</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We devise and analyze an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing the probability that the maximum of a Gaussian vector exceeds a certain level-crossing parameter x. This is a rare event when x is large, so direct Monte Carlo quickly becomes prohibitive. We design an estimator with low variance which is asymptotically independent of the parameter x in certain asymptotic regimes, leading to so-called strong efficiency. This approach has already been used to resolve an open problem in the theory of simulation of Gaussian processes, and could be of interest for other simulation problems.</br>
