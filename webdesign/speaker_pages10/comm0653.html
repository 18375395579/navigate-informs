        <br>Title: State-Independent Importance Sampling for Heavy Tailed Random Walks</br><br>Author: Sandeep Juneja, Professor, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, HB Road, Colaba, Mumbai, 400005, India, juneja@tifr.res.in</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karthyek Rajhaa Anna Murthy, Jose Blanchet</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider two popular rare event probabilities associated with random walks: Large deviations as well as level crossing probabilities when the increments have regularly varying tails. We challenge the prevailing view that complex state-dependent methods are needed for their efficient simulation by developing simpler state-independent methods that have asymptotically vanishing relative error. Numerically the proposed methods perform better than the existing ones.</br>
