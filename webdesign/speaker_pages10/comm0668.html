        <br>Title: Use of Customer Desired Maximum Probability for Bayesian Limit Models</br><br>Author: Roy Creasey, Assistant Professor, Longwood University, 201 High Street, Farmville, VA, 23909, United States of America, creaseyrr@longwood.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Linda Wright, K Preston White, Cheryl Davis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Limit standards are probabilistic interval requirements for proportions.  The focus in simulation literature is on determining the confidence interval, which is inappropriate for limit standards.  Bayesian methods provide approaches that can be utilized for limit standard models.  Instead of the typical methods used to establish the prior distribution, we consider a methodology developed in reliability analysis for defining a priori the maximum desired a posteriori probability of a proportion.</br>
