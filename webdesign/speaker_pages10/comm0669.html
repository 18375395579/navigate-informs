        <br>Title: Hybrid Predictive Control for the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem Based on EMO</br><br>Author: Cristian Cortes, Assistant Professor, Universidad de Chile, Blanco Encalada 2002, Santiago, SA, Chile, ccortes@ing.uchile.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Doris Saez, Alfredo Nuñez, Marcela Riquelme</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A new hybrid adaptive predictive control (HAPC) approach for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem (DPDP) is presented. The approach is solved through an Evolutionary Multiobjetive Optimization (EMO) algorithm, considering the opposite interests of users and operators, both included in the dynamic dispatch objective function. EMO is utilized to find the dynamic Pareto Front, and take the real dispatch decision based on different optimization criteria. Promissory simulation results are reported.</br>
