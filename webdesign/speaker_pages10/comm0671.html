        <br>Title: Calibration and Validation of the Anisotropic Mesoscopic Simulation (AMS) Model</br><br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, PO Box 210072, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, chiu@utep.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Houbing Song</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The Anisotropic mesoscopic Simulation (AMS) model is a mesoscopic traffic simulation approach that is based on directional influence of car-following mechanism.  This talk gives an overview of the model with the focus on the calibration and validation procedure and results of the AMS model using the NGSIM data.</br>
