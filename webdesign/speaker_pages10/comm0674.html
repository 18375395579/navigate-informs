        <br>Title: Identification and Ranking of Factors that Promote Community Population Changes</br><br>Author: Kisuk Sung, Texas A&M University, Dept. of Industrial & Systems Engr., 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843-3131, United States of America, kisuksung@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erick Moreno-Centeno, David Matarrita-Cascante, Justin Yates</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Previous population change studies which have used statistical regression analyses have multicolinearity between input variables and do not provide the size of the influence of input factors on population change. We introduce decision tree clustering and Cohen's d index in order to identify and rank input factors that contribute to population change in a given community without multicolinearity. We discuss an efficient way to encourage population growth within a given budget or time period.</br>
