        <br>Title: A Hybrid Performance Analysis Approach to Grafting Process Design using Simulation and Fuzzy AHP</br><br>Author: Chao Meng, The University of Arizona, 1127 E James E Rogers Way, P.O. Box 210020, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, meng5656@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dong Xu, Young-Jun Son</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A hybrid performance analysis approach integrating discrete event simulation, system dynamics and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed to evaluate grafting process designs. Grafting process and grafted seedling supply chain are simulated to assess the performance of grafting process designs in terms of profit, production flexibility and resource utilization. Fuzzy AHP addresses a multi-objective problem given the performance results and determines the best grafting process designs.</br>
