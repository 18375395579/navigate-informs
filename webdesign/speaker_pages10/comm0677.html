        <br>Title: Response Surface Metholodgy for Simulating Hedging and Trading Strategies</br><br>Author: Evern Baysal, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, e-baysal@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Barry L Nelson, Jeremy Staum</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The distribution of profit and loss resulting from a dynamic trading strategy can be evaluated by nested simulation: at every time step on every simulated path of the relevant financial variables, portfolio weights are estimated by simulation. We use kriging to model portfolio weights as a function of underlying financial variables and show that it provides accuracy comparable to nested simulation with much less computational effort.</br>
