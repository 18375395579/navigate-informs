        <br>Title: Using Only Pencil/Paper Questions to Obtain Exact Quantitative Measurements of Time Inconsistencies</br><br>Author: Peter P. Wakker, Erasmus University, PO Box 1738, Rotterdam, 3000DR, Netherlands, wakker@few.eur.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kirsten Rohde, Arthur E. Attema, Han Bleichrodt</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Time-tradeoff (TTO) sequences can be measured using only pencil and paper.  They easily give exact quantifications of degrees of time inconsistency without need to measure utility.  They, thus, allow for the empirical discrimination between several hyperbolic discounting models that have been proposed in the literature.  Our findings suggest some new directions for theories of intertemporal choice.</br>
