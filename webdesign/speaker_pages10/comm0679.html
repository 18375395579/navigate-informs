        <br>Title: Effect Size and Utility Theory</br><br>Author: Bob Bordley, General Motors Operations Research, M/C 480-106-256, 30500 Mound Road, Warren, MI, 48090, United States, robert.bordley@gm.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper shows that the utility of a decision is mathematically equivalent to a widely used measure for evaluating the effect of experimental treatments. This formal equivalence between these two measures suggests ways of diffusing utility theory into experimental fields in medicine, psychology and the social sciences.</br>
