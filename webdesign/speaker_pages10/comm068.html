        <br>Title: Dynamic Hedging of Portfolio Credit Derivatives</br><br>Author: Yu Hang Kan, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, yk2246@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rama Cont</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we study hedging of synthetic CDO with the underlying CDS index in various top-down models. Numerical results obtained in models calibrated to iTraxx market data reveal significant differences in the hedge ratios and show, unlike what has been previously suggested in the literature by comparing copula-based models, that hedging strategies are subjected to a substantial amount of model risk.</br>
