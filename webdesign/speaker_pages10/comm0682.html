        <br>Title: Prediction and Prognosis of Time to Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Onset</br><br>Author: Satish Bukkapatnam, Professor, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, United States of America, satish.t.bukkapatnam@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Trung Le</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a Dirichlet process-based mixture Gaussian process model to predict the onset of OSA episodes and to derive the distribution of the time to the apneic onset using a stochastic network representation of the dynamical transition and topology of the phase-space reconstructed from the multivariate degradation-based sensory signals. Extensive test suggests that the accuracies (R2) for 1-3 min ahead predictions are 83%-77%, and average prediction of expected time to apneic onsets is 72%.</br>
