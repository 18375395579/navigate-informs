        <br>Title: Boundary Evolution Equations for American Options</br><br>Author: Daniel Mitchell, University of Texas, McCombs School of Business, 1 University Station, B6000, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Daniel.Mitchell@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kumar Muthuraman, Jonathan Goodman</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding optimal exercise policies for American options in constant and stochastic volatility. We derive and use boundary evolution equations that characterize the evolution of the optimal exercise boundary. Using these boundary evolution equations we show how one can construct very efficient computational methods for pricing American options.</br>
