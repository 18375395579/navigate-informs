        <br>Title: Approximate Dynamic Programming in the Presence of Rare Events</br><br>Author: Shie Mannor, Assistant Professor, McGill University, McConnell Engineering Building, Rm. 525, 3480 University Street, Montreal, QC, H3A-2A7, Canada, shie.mannor@mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Doina Precup, Jordan Frank</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider approximate dynamic programming in an environment in which rare significant events occur independently of the actions selected by the controlling agent. Assuming access to a simulator, in which the rare event probabilities can be artificially altered, we introduce  algorithms for policy evaluation, using both tabular and function approximation representations of the value function. We present empirical performance of the algorithms on a large network planning task.</br>
