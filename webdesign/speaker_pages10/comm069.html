        <br>Title: A Sensor-fusion based Methodology for Real-time System Prognostics</br><br>Author: Kamran Paynabar, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, kamran.paynabar@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nagi Gebraeel, Xiaolei Fang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The availability of sensor technology has facilitated the capability of monitoring systems degradation. In this research, we develop a multi-sensor prognostic methodology to dynamically estimate residual lifetime (RL) of partially degraded systems. First, a regularized functional regression model is developed to identify sensors whose signals are correlated with degradation processes. These signals are then fused via multi-dimensional functional PCA that is used to predict the RL of a system.</br>
