        <br>Title: Dirichlet Process Based Gaussian Mixture Model for Multi-step Forecasting in Complex Systems</br><br>Author: Changqing Cheng, Research Assistant, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States of America, changqing.cheng@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We employed Dirichlet process based Gaussian mixture models to handle the matrix inversion and stationary covariance assumption issues in Gaussian processes, and investigated it for complex system multiple-step forecasting. The application in atomistic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of carbon nanotube synthesis process indicates that this forecasting approach can save over 80% of the MC simulation computational expense.</br>
