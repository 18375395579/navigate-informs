        <br>Title: A Distribution-Free Multivariate Phase I Location Control Chart</br><br>Author: Allison Jones-Farmer, Auburn University, 415 W. Magnolia Ave, Suite 420, Auburn, AL, 36849, United States of America, joneall@auburn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Bell, Nedret Billor</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A proper Phase I analysis is essential to the success of Phase II monitoring. This research develops a Phase I location control chart for multivariate processes.  The resulting in-control reference sample can then be used to estimate the parameters for Phase II monitoring.  The proposed method is compared to the Hotelling's T2 Phase I chart.  The proposed method is shown to perform significantly better under non-normality.</br>
