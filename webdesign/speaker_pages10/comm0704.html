        <br>Title: Incorporate Activity Sensitivity Measures into Buffer Management to Manage Project Schedule Risk</br><br>Author: Xue jun Hu, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, School of Management,1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, 430074, China, huxuejun0626@foxmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nan fang Cui</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A new buffer monitoring method is proposed by introducing activity based sensitivity measures (i.e. the Cruciality index) in a traditional PERT framework into the critical chain buffer management approach for the purpose of more efficiently managing project schedules and coping with schedule risk. Results of an experimental application are given to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of management control efforts and the tracking efficiency.</br>
