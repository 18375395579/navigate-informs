        <br>Title: An Application of Clusterwise Regression  to Model Heterogeneity of Pavement Panel Data</br><br>Author: Weizeng Zhang, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, A316, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, WeizengZhang2009@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A post hoc clustering model is presented to predict pavement performance and partition pavement sections into segments where sections have the greatest similarity in terms of the performance deterioration process. Different from Random Effects, Fixed Effects and Random Coefficients models, the proposed clustering model captures the heterogeneity on the segment level. The clustering results can aid R&M decision making for each segment. A numerical comparison is provided based on AASHO dataset.</br>
