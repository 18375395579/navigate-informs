        <br>Title: Using Decision Analysis to Determine Objective Function Weights for Capital Budgeting Problems</br><br>Author: Paul Ewing, Assistant Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, 1411 Cunningham Road, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, paul.ewing@us.army.mil</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: There are often competing multiple objectives when planning military resource allocation. Many times, the measures of effectiveness (MOE) and tradeoffs used in the optimization objective function are ill-defined or non-existent. We discuss applications where decision analysis has been used to help prioritize the MOE’s and define weights for the objective function.</br>
