        <br>Title: Detection of Anomalous Maintenance Patterns in Support of Management of an Aviation Fleet</br><br>Author: Norman Sondheimer, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, United States of America, sondheimer@cs.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Artur Dubrawski</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis of maintenance records to determine unusual patterns of behavior has been found effective in providing early warning of systematic failures of components. This presentation shows how these techniques were integrated into the management of aircraft fleets.  The results can be generalized to fleets of other types of equipment.</br>
