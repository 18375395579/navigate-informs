        <br>Title: Optimization of Accelerated Life Testing Plans with Multiple Stresses</br><br>Author: Elsayed Elsayed, Professor, Department of Industrial and System Engineering, Rutgers University, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854-8018, United States, elsayed@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hao Zhang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Multiple-stress-type ALTs have been employed as a means of overcoming such difficulties. In this paper, we design optimum multiple-stress-type ALT plans based on the proportional odds model. The optimum combinations of stress levels and the optimum number test units allocated to each combination are determined such that the variance of the reliability prediction of the product over a pre-specified period of time is minimized. The proposed ALT plans are illustrated by numerical example.</br>
