        <br>Title: On the Distribution of the Nearly Nonstationary AR(1) Process with Heavy Tails</br><br>Author: Mariana Olvera-Cravioto, Columbia University, 500 W. 120th Street, Rm. 306, New York, NY, United States of America, molvera@ieor.columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the distribution of an AR(1) process when the regression coefficient is close to one. It is known that an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process can be used to approximate its steady-state distribution, which provides a Gaussian limit for moderate tail values. On the other hand, when the errors have a regularly-varying distribution so does the steady-state distribution of the AR(1) process. We combine these two facts to obtain approximations that hold uniformly on the positive axis.</br>
