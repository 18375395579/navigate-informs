        <br>Title: Technical Efficiency Estimation with Multiple Inputs and Multiple Outputs Using Regression Analysis</br><br>Author: John Ruggiero, J. Robert Berry Endowed Faculty Fellow, University of Dayton, 517 Miriam Hall, Department of Economics and Finance, Dayton, OH, 45469, United States, John.Ruggiero@notes.udayton.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Regression and linear programming are two popular techniques for estimating efficiency.  A purported disadvantage of the regression based models is the inability to allow multiple outputs without additional data on input prices.  In this paper, a multiple output regression model is developed.  Notably, technical efficiency can be estimated using Corrected OLS in multiple-input, multiple-output environments without input price data.</br>
