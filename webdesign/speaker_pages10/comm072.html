        <br>Title: Evaluating Artificial Neural Network Approaches Used for Time Series Forecasting</br><br>Author: Erkam Guresen, Istanbul Technical University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Maçka,, Istanbul, 34367, Turkey, erkamguresen@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gülgün Kayakutlu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: During the last few years, a number of ANN models and hybrid models have been proposed for obtaining accurate prediction results, in an attempt to outperform the traditional linear and nonlinear approaches. This study evaluates the effectiveness of neural network models; MLP, LTS, RNN, DAN2 and the hybrid neural networks which use GARCH and EGARCH to extract new input variables. The performance comparisons of these models are realized on daily exchange rates of ISE index XU100 using MSE and MAD.</br>
