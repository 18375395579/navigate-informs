        <br>Title: Design and Analysis for Mixture-of-mixture Experiments</br><br>Author: Lulu Kang, Georgia Institute of Technology, 350440 Gatech Station, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, lulu@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Brenneman, Roshan Josep Vengazhiyil</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In mixture-of-mixture (MoM) experiments, major components are defined as the components which themselves are mixtures of some other components, or minor components. In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach called major-minor model. It overcomes some of the limitations of multiple-Scheffe model. We also introduce a major-minor D-optimal design strategy for designing the experiment.</br>
