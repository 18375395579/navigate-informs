        <br>Title: Bayesian Site Selection for Gaussian Process Regression</br><br>Author: Arash Pourhabib, Research Assistant, Texas A&M University, TAMU 3131, College Station, TX, 77840, United States of America, arash.pourhabib@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Ding, Faming Liang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: One major difficulty attributed to Gaussian Process (GP) regression is its computational complexity. We propose a Bayesian Site Selection (BSS) method to approximate GP through utilizing latent variables. The BSS is then solved using reversible jump MCMC methods. The BSS provides accurate prediction while spending reasonable computation time.</br>
