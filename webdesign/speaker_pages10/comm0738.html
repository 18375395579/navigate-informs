        <br>Title: Identifying Outliers in Complex Profile Baseline after Smoothed by Kernel Partial Least Squares</br><br>Author: Hang Zhang, Arizona State University, PO Box 875906, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, hzhang12@asu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We focus on identifying outliers among complex profiles. Profiles are first smoothed by kernel partial least squares (KPLS). KPLS captures nonlinear relationships between explanatory and response variables. Then, we propose two control charts to identify outlying profiles through smoothed profiles or the residuals of KPLS. Simulations show its good performance.</br>
