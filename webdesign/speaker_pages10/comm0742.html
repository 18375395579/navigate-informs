        <br>Title: Design and Analysis Issues for Gaussian Process Models for High Dimensioanl Computer Experiments</br><br>Author: Derek Bingham, Simon Fraser University, Dept. Statistics and Actuarial Science, 8888 University Dr., Burnaby, BC, Canada, dbingham@stat.sfu.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) models are often used for modeling computer experiment output.   In many applications the number of factors is large (e.g., say 60 factors).   Thus, the number of simulations carried out trials tends to be large.  However, fitting a GP becomes computationally burdensome for large run sizes. Here, we describe strategies we've found useful for fitting such models when the number of simulation runs is large.  The consequences of inadequate run-sizes are discussed.</br>
