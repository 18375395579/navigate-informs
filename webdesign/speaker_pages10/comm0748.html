        <br>Title: Optimal Variance Sensitive Condition Based Maintenance via Simulation</br><br>Author: Nan Chen, University of Wisconsin Madison, Room 3255, 1513 University Ave, Madison, WI, 53705, United States of America, nchen3@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shiyu Zhou, Yong Chen, Zhiguo Li</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, variance sensitive condition based maintenance policies are considered to better control the risk and plan for the budget. Instead of traditional methods, a simulation optimization approach is given to find the optimal solution and investigate the sensitivity of the parameters.</br>
