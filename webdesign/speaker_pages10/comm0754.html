        <br>Title: Dynamic Mean-safety-First and Synamic mean-VaR Formulations</br><br>Author: Duan Li, Chair Professor, Department of Systems Engineering & Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, dli@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ke Zhou</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We report in this talk recent progress in investigating the relationship between the dynamic mean-safety-first and dynamic mean-VaR formulations. As the dynamic mean-VaR formulation is time inconsistent, or nonseparable in the sense of dynamic, we use the dynamic mean-safety-first as an auxiliary problem. We further study how to improve the investment policy to the dynamic mean-VaR formulation.</br>
