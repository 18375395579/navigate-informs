        <br>Title: Option Pricing with Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems</br><br>Author: Nagendra Nagarur, Associate Professor, Binghamton University, SSIE Department, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, 13902, United States of America, nnagarur@binghamton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Domnic Ojala</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Two heuristic systems, Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems, are developed to estimate option prices. The models are tested on S&P-500 Index options. The results are compared to those obtained by Black-Scholes method. A detailed error analysis is carried out comparing the relative efficiencies of all the three methods.</br>
