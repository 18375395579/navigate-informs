        <br>Title: Comparing Stochastic and Deterministic Models for Inventory Problems</br><br>Author: William Cooper, University of Minnesota, 111 Church St SE, United States of America, billcoop@me.umn.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider inventory problems with unknown demand distributions, and we compare the performance of stochastic and deterministic models for selecting order quantities when the parameters of the models are estimated from data.  The goal is to identify when the stochastic model outperforms the deterministic model and vice versa.</br>
