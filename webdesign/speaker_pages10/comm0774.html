        <br>Title: Statistical Process Screening System: An Approach For Identifying Irregular Individuals</br><br>Author: Peihua Qiu, Professor, University of Minnesota, 224 Church Street SE, 313 Ford Hall, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, qiuxx008@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dongdong Xiang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We often need to identify individuals whose longitudinal pattern in certain   indices is different from the pattern of those normally working individuals.   In many applications, observations of a given individual are obtained   sequentially, and it is desirable to have a screening system to give a signal   of irregular longitudinal pattern as soon as possible. This paper proposes a   method for that purpose.</br>
