        <br>Title: Risk Tolerance as Maximum Acceptable Loss: Theory and Experimental Evidence from Business Executives</br><br>Author: Philippe Delqui? INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, France, philippe.delquie@insead.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Could it be helpful to think of your risk tolerance as a maximum probable loss you are willing to face, no matter how large the upside? This may be natural to decision makers in some contexts. Exponential utility permits such an interpretation, but we should be mindful of possible pitfalls. The possibility and merits of this approach to measuring risk taking propensity will be discussed. Experimental evidence from private equity and banking executives will be presented to illustrate the issues.</br>
