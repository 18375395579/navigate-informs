        <br>Title: Enhanced Indexation Based on Second-Order Stochastic Dominance</br><br>Author: Gautam Mitra, President, Optirisk System, London, United Kingdom, gautam@optirisk-systems.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diana Roman, Victor Zverovich</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Second order Stochastic Dominance (SSD) is well established in portfolio selection as it captures the behaviour of a risk-averse investor. SSD-based models construct a portfolio, whose return distribution SSD dominates the reference distribution. We present an empirical study which analyses the effectiveness of such strategies in the context of enhanced indexation;this leads to a unified framework which incorporates (a) SSD, (b) downside risk (CVaR) minimisation and (c) enhanced indexation.</br>
