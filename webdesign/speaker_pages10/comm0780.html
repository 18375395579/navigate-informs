        <br>Title: Time Changed Markov Processes in United Credit-equity Modeling</br><br>Author: Rafael Mendoza, PhD Student, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd. Room C151, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States of America, rafaelmendoza2008@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Linetsky, Peter Carr</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Hybrid credit-equity models are developed with state-dependent jumps, local-stochastic volatility and default intensity based on time changes of Markov processes. We model the stock price process as a time changed Markov process with state-dependent local volatility and killing rate. When the time change is a Levy process in turn time changed with a time integral of an activity rate process, the stock price process has state-dependent jumps, stochastic volatility and default intensity.</br>
