        <br>Title: In-play Football Prediction</br><br>Author: Nils Rudi, Professor of Technology and Operations Management, INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Ave, Singapore, 138676, Singapore, Nils.RUDI@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Harry Groenevelt, Bhavani Shanker Uppari</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We model the scoring of two football teams as two Poisson processes. For a given pre-game predictive distribution, we show that there exists a unique pair of arrival rates, which facilitate in-play prediction as function of time and score. This result is extended to time and score dependent arrival rates, and comparisons with Logistic regression is provided. We test the models on an extensive data set from major European football leagues.</br>
