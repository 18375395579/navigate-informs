        <br>Title: Distributionally Robust Optimization under Moment Uncertainty with Application to Data-Driven Problems</br><br>Author: Erick Delage, Stanford University, Packard 069, Stanford, CA, United States of America, edelage@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic programs can effectively describe the decision-making problem in an uncertain environment. Unfortunately, such programs are often computationally demanding to solve. In addition, their solutions can be misleading when there is ambiguity in the choice of a distribution for the random parameters. In this paper, we propose a model describing ones uncertainty in both the distribution’s form (discrete, Gaussian, exponential, etc.) and moments (mean and covariance). We demonstrate that for a wide range of cost functions the associated distributionally robust stochastic program can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, by deriving new confidence regions for the mean and covariance of a random vector, we provide probabilistic arguments for using our model in problems that rely heavily on historical data. This is confirmed in a practical example of portfolio selection, where our framework leads to better performing policies on the “true?distribution underlying the daily return of assets.</br>
