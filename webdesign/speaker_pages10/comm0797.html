        <br>Title: Importance Sampling for the Reliability Evaluation with a Stochastic Computer Model</br><br>Author: Youngjun Choe, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States of America, yjchoe@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eunshin Byon, Nan Chen, Vijay Nair</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We extend the theory of importance sampling to estimate a system's reliability with a stochastic computer simulation. The proposed method aims to minimize the variance of failure probability estimator in a complex stochastic system. The method is applied to evaluate the reliability of a wind turbine based on computationally expensive aerodynamic simulations. The implementation results show that significant computational gains can be obtained, compared with other methods.</br>
