        <br>Title: Fixed Pie or Fixed Variable?</br><br>Author: David Budescu, Professor of Psychology, University off Illinois, 603 E. Daniel street, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, dbudescu@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ali Abbas, Hsiu Ting Yu, Ryan Haggerty</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: When encoding subjective probabilities of continuous variables judges can specify (a) cumulative probabilities for a set of values, or (b) values that correspond to particular cumulative probabilities. We report results of an experiment comparing these approaches. Judges estimated probability distributions using both methods.  A variety of results favor the fixed value method: The judgments are more consistent, valid, accurate and faster. Most judges prefer this method.</br>
