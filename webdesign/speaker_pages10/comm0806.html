        <br>Title: Composite Gaussian Process Models for Emulating Expensive Functions</br><br>Author: Shan Ba, Ph.D. Candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, Ga, 30332, United States of America, shan.ba@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roshan Vengazhiyil</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A new type of non-stationary Gaussian process model is developed for approximating computationally expensive functions. The new model is a composite of two Gaussian processes, where the first one captures the smooth global trend and the second one models local details. The new predictor also incorporates a flexible variance model, which makes it more capable of approximating surfaces with varying volatility.</br>
