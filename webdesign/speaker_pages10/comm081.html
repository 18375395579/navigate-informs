        <br>Title: Popularity versus Optimality: A Consensus Solution for Models of Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Geoffrey A. Chua, NUS Business School</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mabel Chou, Melvyn Sim</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new approach for modelling decisions under uncertainty. Our framework integrates the concept of certainty equivalent from expected utility theory with the notion of target setting from the satisficing literature. Given a decision with an uncertain payoff, different decision makers will have varying assessments due to differences in risk attitudes. In response to this, we offer a consensual solution obtained via approval voting, i.e. one that maximizes the number of decision makers who find the proposed solution acceptable in terms of some target certainty equivalent. Interestingly, our results show that the consensus model preserves the problem complexities of convex optimization, discrete optimization, and dynamic programming. Moreover, an appealing by-product of the model is its robustness with a provision for adjusting the conservatism level using the target certainty equivalent. Finally, we provide examples to illustrate the applicability of our model to a wide range of problems.</br>
