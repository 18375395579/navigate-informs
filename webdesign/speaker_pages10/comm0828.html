        <br>Title: Simulated Likelihood for Jump-diffusions</br><br>Author: Gustavo Schwenkler, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, United States of America, gschwenk@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kay Giesecke</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop and analyze likelihood estimators for the parameters of a discretely observed jump-diffusion. The drift, volatility, jump intensity, and jump size are arbitrary functions of the state. The estimators are based on a novel representation of the transition density that facilitates the exact computation of the density via Monte-Carlo simulation. We provide conditions guaranteeing consistency and asymptotic normality as the sample period grows. Numerical results illustrate our approach.</br>
