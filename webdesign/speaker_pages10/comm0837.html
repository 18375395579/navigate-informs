        <br>Title: A Local Algorithm for Detecting Evolving Communities in Large Weighted Networks</br><br>Author: Bin Zhang, Assistant Professor, Temple University, 209J Speakman, 1810 N. 13th St., Philadelphia, PA, 19122, United States of America, bzhang@temple.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zoran Obradovic, Mladen Nikolic</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present an effective method for community detection in large directed weighted dynamic networks. Our method scales well to networks with millions of nodes observed over time. It is applied to synthetic and real networks and experiments show that the proposed method is the proposed method is as efficient and accurate as the leading algorithms for static unweighted graphs, more importantly it is also effective to identify dense communities in large weighted and in large evolving networks.</br>
