        <br>Title: Multiscale Recurrence Analysis of Long-term Nonlinear and Nonstationary Sensor Signals</br><br>Author: Hui Yang, Assistant Professor, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, huiyang@usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yun Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recurrence analysis is an effective data-driven tool to characterize and quantify the dynamics of complex systems, e.g., laminar, divergent or transition behaviors. However, recurrence computation is highly expensive as the size of time series increases. This paper presents a novel multiscale framework to explore recurrence dynamics in the complex systems and resolve the computational issues for the large-scale datasets. This approach was experimentally validated with real-world sensor signals.</br>
