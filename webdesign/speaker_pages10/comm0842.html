        <br>Title: Bayesian Imperfect Debugging Modeling</br><br>Author: Tevfik Aktekin, The Geeorge Washington University, 2201 G Street, NW, Suite 415, Washington, DC, 20052, United States, taktekin@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Toros Caglar</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The scope of our research is to develop a bayesian imperfect debugging model in software reliability using MCMC methods. The proposed model will help us to study the behavior of the fault detection rate per fault, number of faults left on the software code over time and the reliability of the software up to a particular time via statistical inference.</br>
