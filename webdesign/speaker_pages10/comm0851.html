        <br>Title: A Revised Formulation of Proximal Support Vector Machine with Feature Selection via L21-Norm</br><br>Author: Jiaxing Pi, University of Florida, 401 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, jiaxing@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vijay Pappu, Paul Thottakkara, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Proximal Support Vector Machine has been an efficient technique to generate classifiers and feature selection is an important tool for high dimensional data. The purpose of this research is to combine PSVM with L21-Norm in the objective function, which produces classifiers and relevant features simultaneously. An optimization method is provided to solve the formulation efficiently. Experiments on standard data sets are performed to compare the proposed framework with the standard PSVM.</br>
