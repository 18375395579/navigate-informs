        <br>Title: Data Mining for Forensic Accounting</br><br>Author: Boris Kovalerchuk, Professor, Central Washington University, 400 East University Way, Ellensburg, WA, 98926-7520, United States, borisk@cwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Holtfreter, Evgenii Vityaev</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Link discovery and mining rare/imbalanced events and recently became important areas for discovering financial fraud and linking disparate information for fighting terrorism. The traditional misclassification rate is misleading; it is only 0.001 by classifying every transaction as legitimate with reported 0.001 fraud rate out of all wire and credit card transactions globally. We propose a relational data-mining approach to discover rare and unbalanced patterns in a variety of financial data.</br>
