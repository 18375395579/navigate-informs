        <br>Title: Multiscale Feature Extraction for Embedded Operation Monitoring and Diagnosis</br><br>Author: Judy Jin, Associate Professor, Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, IOE 2855, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, jhjin@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gabrielle Tremblay, Yu Zhou</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: For a complex system consisting of multiple embedded operations, it is challenging to monitor and diagnose individual operation conditions based on the system sensing signals. This research will present a systematic way how to use multiscale wavelets analysis to maximize the diagnosability of extracted features for individual operations in both time and frequency domains.</br>
