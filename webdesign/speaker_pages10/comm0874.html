        <br>Title: Applying the Directional Distance Function to the Electric Utility</br><br>Author: Andrew Johnson, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, 237K Zachry Engineering Center, Department of Industrial and Engineering, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, ajohnson@tamu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The directional distance function (DDF) allows the typical assumption of either cost minimization or revenue maximization to be relaxed in the analysis of technical efficiency.  This presentation explores the application of the directional distance function to the analysis of electric utilities in both the U.S. and Japan.  By applying a novel directional specific method to the panel data, the direction of improvement is identified.  This method can be used in a variety of DDF type models.</br>
