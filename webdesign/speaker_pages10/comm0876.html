        <br>Title: Probability and Time Trade-off with Multiple Outcomes</br><br>Author: Alessandra Cillo, ACillo@iese.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Manel Baucells</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Previous work has introduced a preference model for simple lotteries in which both time and risk dimensions were fully integrated through the probability and time trade-off. In this paper we propose an extension of this work to multiple outcome lotteries with delay. More general measures of sensitivity to outcome magnitude, probability and time are also analyzed in the paper.</br>
