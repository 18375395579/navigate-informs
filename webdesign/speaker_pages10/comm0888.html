        <br>Title: Maximum Entropy Principle with General Deviation Measures</br><br>Author: Bogdan Grechuk, Ph.D Student, Stevens Institute of Technology, bgrechuk@stevens.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Zabarankin, Anton Molyboha</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A random variable maximizing Shannon differential entropy with constraints on the mean and quantile-based deviation measure has been shown to have a log-concave distribution. In the case of comonotonic deviation measure, an optimal distribution has been obtained in explicit form. Conversely, through maximum entropy principle, a log-concave distribution has been shown to correspond to a comonotonic quantile-based deviation measure.</br>
