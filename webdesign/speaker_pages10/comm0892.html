        <br>Title: Some Comparisons Among Quadratic, Spherical, Logarithmic Scoring Rules</br><br>Author: Eric Bickel, Texas A&M University, ebickel@tamu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Strictly proper scoring rules continue to play an important role in probability assessment. While many such rules have been developed, relatively little guidance exists as to which rule is the most appropriate. In this presentation, we discuss two important properties of quadratic, spherical, and logarithmic scoring rules. From an ex post perspective, we compare their rank-order properties. From an ex ante perspective, we analyze their performance under non-linear utility.</br>
