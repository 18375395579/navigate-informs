        <br>Title: An Adaptive Procedure for Estimating Coherent Risk Measures Based on Generalized Scenarios</br><br>Author: Barry Nelson, Professor, Northwestern University, Department of IEMS, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States, nelsonb@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Lesnevski, Jeremy Staum</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Coherent risk measures based on generalized scenarios can be viewed as estimating the maximum expected value from among a collection of simulated systems. We present a procedure for generating a fixed-width confidence interval for this coherent risk measure. The procedure improves upon previous methods by being reliably efficient  for simulation of generalized scenarios and portfolios with heterogeneous characteristics.</br>
