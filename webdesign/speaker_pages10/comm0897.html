        <br>Title: Reliable Genotype Tagging</br><br>Author: Alex Zelikovsky, Georgia State University, Department of Computer Science, Atlanta, GA, 30303, United States of America, alexz@cs.gsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Irina Astrovskaya</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: It is widely accepted that variation of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is covered by another SNP if their correlation is greater than 0.8.  Tagging saves budget by genotyping less SNPs and haplotype computation by reducing the size of the SNP data. We propose a new 2LR-tagging method that finds less SNPs than widely accepted Tagger and avoids of overfitting of tagging based on multiple linear regression.</br>
