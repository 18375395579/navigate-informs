        <br>Title: Surface Variation Monitoring by Integrating Spatial Data with Cutting Force Models</br><br>Author: Hui Wang, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, huiwz@umich.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Variation control of surface shape becomes a key enabler of high-precision machining. This talk presents a method for efficiently measuring and monitoring variations of machined surfaces. Cutting force modeling is conducted and is correlated with surface spatial data to improve surface profile prediction. Using the prediction, a strategy under Bayesian framework is proposed to monitor surface variations without significantly increasing false alarms. A Ford case study demonstrates the method.</br>
