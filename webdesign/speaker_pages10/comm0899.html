        <br>Title: A Framework for Understanding Uncertainty in Graphene Growth Process Modeling</br><br>Author: Sobambo Sosina, Graduate Research Assistant, Harvard University, 1 Oxford St, 7th floor, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, sosina@fas.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tirthankar Dasgupta, Qiang Huang, Jian Wu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Graphene has many important properties and has been identified as a very efficient and cheap ingredient in a lot of industrial applications. Unfortunately, there has not been much work done in understanding the kinetics that drive the graphene growth process. We propose a rate-based model that correctly quantifies the uncertainty in our model parameters. We further extend the graphene shape model to account for possible spatial dependence using a lattice spatial model.</br>
