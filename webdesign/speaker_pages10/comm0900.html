        <br>Title: A General Framework for Monitoring of Dynamic Systems</br><br>Author: Kwok-Leung Tsui, Professor, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States, ktsui@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Jiang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This talk discusses strategies and techniques in data modeling, forecasting, and activity monitoring.  We will propose a general strategy for modeling, forecasting, and monitoring of dynamic systems.  In particular, we will discuss a statistical process control approach for business activity monitoring.  We will also discuss a churn detection procedure for customer profile modeling.  Some case studies in telecom and service industries will be used to illustrate the proposed methods.</br>
