        <br>Title: Multiple Objective Optimization for Degrading Systems - Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Pipeline</br><br>Author: David Coit, Industrial and Systems Eng, Rutgers University, Piscataway, United States of America, coit@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sanling Song, Qianmei Feng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: LNG pipeline reliability is analyzed based on dependent competing failure processes and multi-objective optimization. LNG pipeline failure can pose significant threat to people and property in vicinity of failure. Some failures are time independent, e.g., mechanical interference by third party, earthquake or overpressure, while other failures are time dependent e.g., corrosion or fatigue failures.</br>
