        <br>Title: Rapidly Deployable Sensory-Based Prognostic Models</br><br>Author: Nagi Gebraeel, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, 3131 Seamans Center, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, gebraeel@engineering.uiowa.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Successful deployment of prognostic models requires prior knowledge of degradation processes. This information is available in databases consisting of degradation-based signals. Unfortunately, these databases may not be available for legacy systems, and their development can be very expensive. This research proposes a mathematical framework that enables the development of adaptive prognostic models for predicting residual life distributions in the absence of prior degradation information.</br>
