        <br>Title: An Interactive Search Method Based on User Preferences</br><br>Author: Asim Roy, Department of Information Systems, Arizona State University, PO Box 874606, AZ, 85287-4606, ASIM.ROY@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jyrki Wallenius, Patrick Mackin, James Corner</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a method to search for objects in a large collection where objects are defined by a large number of discrete attributes. The iterative method presents some objects and allows one to indicate a preference for them by: (1) assigning objects to predefined categories, or (2) by direct preference comparison of objects. From these preference statements, the method approximates the user’s value function. It uses this approximate value function to re-rank objects in the collection and retrieve top-ranked ones to present to the user at the next iteration. Test results are reported.</br>
