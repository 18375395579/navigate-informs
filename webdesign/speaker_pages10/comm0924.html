        <br>Title: Sequential Minimum Energy Design for Synthsis of Nanostructures</br><br>Author: Tirthankar Dasgupta, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, tdasgupt@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roshan Vengazhiyil, C. F. Jeff Wu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A sequential space filling design called Sequential Minimum Energy Design (SMED) is proposed for exploring best process conditions for synthesis of nanowires. The SMED is a novel approach to generate designs that are model independent, can quickly carve out regions with no observable nanostructure morphology, allow for the exploration of complex response surfaces, and can be used for sequential experimentation.</br>
