        <br>Title: Run to Run Process Ajustment Using Categorical Observations</br><br>Author: Fugee Tsung, Dept. of Industrial Eng & Logistics Mgt, HK Univ. of Science & Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, HK, Hong Kong - ROC, season@ust.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kaibo Wang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: When quality characteristics cannot be measured on a continuous scale due to either inherent or outside constraints, qualitative observations can be collected alternatively. Under these situations, most conventional run-to-run (R2R) process control algorithms that are developed based on quantitative measurements cannot be implemented. In this paper, we develop a novel run-to-run control scheme that uses qualitative information for process adjustments.</br>
