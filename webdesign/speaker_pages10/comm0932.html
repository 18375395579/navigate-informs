        <br>Title: Optimization Methods in Blind Signal Separation Based on Structural Assumptions</br><br>Author: Mujahid Syed, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America, smujahid@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pando Georgiev, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Blind Signal Separation (BSS) is a common scenario that arises in practical data analysis. BSS can be stated as separation of original data from a mixture of data. Nonlinear mixtures are hard to separate; however, even for the case of linear mixtures, BSS has been termed as ‘panacea? Independent Component Analysis(ICA) is a BSS method based on statistical assumptions. In this talk, the usage of optimization methods in solving BSS problem with structural assumptions will be presented.</br>
