        <br>Title: The Visual Interactive Site Analysis Code (VISAC)</br><br>Author: Joe Lake, Software Engineer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1 Bethel Valley Road, MS - 6085, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831, United States, lakeje@ornl.gov</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: VISAC is a Java-based, expert system that provides security analysts with a coordinated capability to predict and analyze the outcomes of multiple accidents/incidents at various facilities.  The incidents can range from simple individual equipment sabotage to complex sorties that utilize a wide range of weapons. Using event/fault tree methodology, VISAC provides the probability of facility kill, the probability of undesirable collateral effects, and an estimate of facility down time.</br>
