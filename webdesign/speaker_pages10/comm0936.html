        <br>Title: A Data-driven Prescriptive Analytics Approach to Optimize a Portfolio</br><br>Author: Durai Sundaramoorthi, Washington University in St. Louis, Olin Business School, Saint Louis, MO, 63141, United States of America, dsundaramoorthi@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger, Aihong Wen, Victoria C Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is a method of predictive analytics that attempts to predict or classify using a set of continuous or categorical variables. In this research, using CART, a simulation model has been developed to observe transition states of stocks in a portfolio. Utilizing design of experiments, objective values are observed from the simulation at selected portfolio points. We then approximate the objective function to use in prescriptive analytics.</br>
