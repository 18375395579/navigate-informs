        <br>Title: Integrated Human Decision Making and Planning Model for Emergency Evacuation Crowd Simulation</br><br>Author: Young-Jun Son, Associate Professor, The University of Arizona, Systems and Industrial Engineering, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, son@sie.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Judy Jin, Seungho Lee</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: An integrated Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) modeling framework is proposed for human decision behavior, which involve Bayesian belief network, Decision-Field-Theory, and probabilistic depth first search technique.  Attributes of the model are reverse-engineered from human experiments conducted in CAVE.  The proposed BDI model is demonstrated for human’s evacuation behaviors under a terrorist bomb attack.  The environment and agents are implemented in AnyLogic agent-based simulation software.</br>
