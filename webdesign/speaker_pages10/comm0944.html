        <br>Title: Tractable Portfolio VaR Optimization</br><br>Author: Dessislava Pachamanova, Assistant Professor, Babson College, 319 Babson Hall, Babson Park, MA, 02457, United States, dpachamanova@babson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Melvyn Sim, Karthik Natarajan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We discuss a computationally tractable parametric method for portfolio Value-at-Risk (VaR) optimization based on robust optimization techniques. The method uses optimization of a modified risk measure that is coherent, and is thus desirable from a financial theory perspective as well. Numerical experiments suggest that the approach outperforms other parametric and sample-based approaches for VaR optimization used in practice, especially when return distributions are skewed.</br>
