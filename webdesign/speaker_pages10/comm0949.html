        <br>Title: Computational Model of Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) of MgO Growth on 6H-SiC Substrate</br><br>Author: Abe Zeid, Northeastern University, MIE Department, Boston, MA, United States of America, zeid@coe.neu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sagar Kamarthi, Ghulam Uddin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of MgO on 6H-SiC is studied for effective integration of functional oxides. In this research we present the neural network assisted design of experiment (DOE) analysis of the growth rate of  MgO films grown over 6H-SiC substrates. Based on the effective attenuation length (EAL) of silicon intensity we calculate the thickness of film under varying control variables.</br>
