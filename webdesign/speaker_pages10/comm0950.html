        <br>Title: Scheduling TV Advertisements with Uncertain Ratings</br><br>Author: Sriram Subramanian, SriramSu@rsgsystems.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sebastian Souyris, Sridhar Seshari</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Television ratings have significant volatility in audience composition that affect effective scheduling of advertisements. We propose a robust optimization approach to address the rating uncertainty in order to maximize the yield under the realization of adverse scenarios that can happen with no negligible probability. In this talk we will discuss the robust problem formulation and the degree of conservatism represented by the trade off between robust solutions and nominal problem solutions.</br>
