        <br>Title: A Mean-field Model of Systemic Risk and its Large Deviations</br><br>Author: Tzu-Wei Yang, Stanford University, 419 Lagunita Dr., Apt. 19, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, twyang@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Papanicolaou, Josselin Garnier</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We model a banking system as an interacting particle system and each component affects the others through their mean field. The system has two stable states that can be interpreted as the normal and failed states. The transition from the system's normal state to the failed state could happen with an exponentially small probability. We use large deviations to compute this small probability and argue that risk sharing may reduce the individual risk but at the same time increase the systemic risk.</br>
