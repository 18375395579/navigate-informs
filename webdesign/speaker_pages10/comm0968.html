        <br>Title: Web-based Multi-Criteria Spatial Decision Support System DECERNS</br><br>Author: Sergey Gritsyuk, PhD, National Research Nuclear University MEPHI, Studgorodok 1, Obninsk, Russian Federation, s.gritsyuk@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexey Babutski, Boris Yatsalo, Vladimir Didenko, Oleg Mirzeabasov</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: DECERNS is a web-based spatial decision support system. It integrates GIS tools and MCDA methods. It can also be integrated with a model server containing site specific models.  Integration between GIS and MCDA tools provided with setting spatial alternatives and map based criteria (automatically transfer attributes for alternatives to the performance table).  The DECERNS WebSDSS has been implemented for investigation of several actual case studies on land-use planning, and risk management.</br>
