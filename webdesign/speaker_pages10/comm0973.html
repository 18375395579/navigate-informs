        <br>Title: Localization of Myocardial Infarction using Vectorcardiogram Octant Transition Network</br><br>Author: Trung Le, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, Ok, 74075, United States of America, trung.le@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Bukkapatnam</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Myocardial Infarction is a leading cause of death in the US. Detecting the location of MI in the early stages can significantly improve treatment efficiency and reduce mortality risks. We present an approach that uses the topological features of octant network reconstructed from VCG  signals to detect and localize MI. Extensive tests using  data of from Physionet indicate that  transition features can differentiate  healthy, inferior, anterior MI with >92% sensitivity and >93% specificity.</br>
