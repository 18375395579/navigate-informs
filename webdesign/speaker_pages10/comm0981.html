        <br>Title: Damage Identification for High-Speed Train Gearbox Shell Material Base on Acoustic Emission Technology</br><br>Author: Weidong Zhang, University of  Science & Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuanroad, Haidian District, Beijing, 100083, China, zwd@ustb.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiwen Zhang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The failure of high-speed train gearbox shell material is very important for the safety of high-speed train.In this paper,we use acoustic emission technology to monitor the the degree of damage in high-speed train gearbox shell material.The research work includes two main aspects: the data pre-processing method for imbalanced dataset and SVM modification method for imbalanced dataset. Then we apply these methods in the damage identification of high-speed train gearbox shell material.</br>
