        <br>Title: Cross-domain Model Building and Validation (CDMV): A New Modeling Strategy to Reinforce Understanding of Nanomanufacturing Processes</br><br>Author: Li Wang, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Ave., RM 236, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, wang40@usc.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Understanding nanostructure growth faces issues of limited data, lack of physical knowledge, and  large process uncertainties. These issues result in modeling difficulty because a large pool of candidate models almost fit the data equally well. Through the Integrated Nanomanufacturing and Nanoinformatics (INN) strategy, we derive the process models from physical and statistical  domains, respectively, and reinforce the understanding of growth processes by identifying the common model structure across two domains. We present this method by studying the weight growth kinetics of silica nanowire under two temperature conditions. The derived nanowire growth model is able to provide physical insights for prediction and control under uncertainties.</br>
