        <br>Title: Reliability Analysis for Dependent Competing Risk Processes with Degradation Rate Transition</br><br>Author: Qianmei Feng, Associate Professor, University of Houston, E206 Engineering Building 2, Houston, United States of America, qfeng@central.uh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Coit, Koosha Rafiee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop reliability models for systems subject to dependent risks of degradation and random shocks with a degradation rate transition according to particular random shock patterns. The degradation rate can change when the system becomes more susceptible to fatigue and deteriorates faster, as a result of withstanding shocks. We consider four different shock patterns that can increase the degradation rate: (1) extreme shock model; (2) d-shock model; (3) m-shock model; and (4) run shock model.</br>
