<br>Title: Optimal Occupancy-driven Parking Pricing under Demand Uncertainties and Traveler Heterogeneity</br><br>Author: Sean Qian, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, seanqian@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ram Rajagopal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A novel parking pricing strategy dependent on real-time sensing is proposed to manage the parking demand. Parking pricing and information provision jointly serve as a dynamic stabilized controller to minimize the total travel time (TTT) of the system. Parking prices are adjusted in real time according to the real-time occupancy collected by parking sensors.</br>
