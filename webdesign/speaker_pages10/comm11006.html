<br>Title: Real-time Pricing of Managed Lanes with Refund Option</br><br>Author: Yingyan Lou, Assistant Professor, Arizona State University, P.O. Box 875306, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, yingyan.lou@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abhay Lidbe</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: To improve travelers' experiences with managed lanes (ML), this study explores an innovative solution by introducing a refund option. Part of the toll paid by a traveler will be refunded if the travel time saving does not reach a certain minimal amount guaranteed. The goal of this pricing scheme is to achieve the operational objectives of MLs, including desired facility level of service and revenue return that can cover refund claims, and at the same time make MLs more appealing to travelers.</br>
