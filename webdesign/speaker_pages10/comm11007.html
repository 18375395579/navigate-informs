<br>Title: Modeling and Optimizing Transportation Decisions in a Manufacturing Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Suleyman Karabuk, Assistant Professor, University of Oklahoma, School of Industrial Engineering, 200 West Boyd, Room 124, Norman, OK, 73019, United States, karabuk@ou.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We describe a transportation problem we observed at the trucking division of a manufacturer that owns and operates a large number of facilities in all stages of the supply chain. The problem involves scheduling of pick-up and delivery of daily inventory movement between plants. We develop integer programming models that are based on the current workflow of the schedulers and capture and optimize crucial aspects of the problem. We validate the models and demonstrate their use with actual data.</br>
