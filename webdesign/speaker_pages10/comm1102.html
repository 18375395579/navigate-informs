<br>Title: Generalized Regenerator Location Problem</br><br>Author: Si Chen, Assistant Professor, Murray State University, College of Business and Public Affairs, Murray, KY, 42071, United States of America, si.chen@murraystate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Raghavan, Ivana Ljubic</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In the generalized regenerator location problem (in optical networks) we are given a set of terminal nodes T that need to communicate. It is necessary to install regenerators if the distance between a pair of nodes in T is greater than L. Regenerators can only be installed at a subset of nodes S in the network. We wish to minimize the number of regenerators (or a weighted combination). We describe heuristics for the problem, and an MIP model, and our computational experiences with both.</br>
