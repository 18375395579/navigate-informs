<br>Title: Sensor Location Problems for Path-differentiated Congestion Pricing</br><br>Author: Mahmood Zangui, University of Florida, 365 Weil Hall, Gainesville, United States of America, mzangui@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin, Siriphong Lawphongpanich</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Path-differentiated congestion pricing is a pricing scheme where tolls are imposed on paths instead of individual links. To implement the scheme, sensors such as toll tag readers are installed to collect the location information of vehicles in order to charge them accordingly. In this talk, we investigate the problems of finding optimal sensor locations to implement path-differentiated pricing to minimize system travel time and optimize another secondary objective.</br>
