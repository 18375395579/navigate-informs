<br>Title: An Extended QFD Planning Model for Goal Attainment Considering Longitudinal Effect</br><br>Author: Dae-Kee Min, Pohang Univ of Science and Technology, Industrial and Management Engineering, Pohang, Ky, Korea, Republic of, pupamin@postech.ac.kr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kwang-Jae Kim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes an extended QFD planning model for goal attainment that considers longitudinal effect. In the longitudinal effect case, the level of goal is determined by a series of effects over a certain period of time rather than by the effect at a specific point of time. In the proposed model, the longitudinal effect is incorporated by introducing a time dimension into the existing house of quality structure. The proposed model is illustrated using a case in high-speed internet service.</br>
