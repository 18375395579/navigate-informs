<br>Title: Solution Techniques for a Crane Sequencing Problem</br><br>Author: Jin Shang, Quality Planning Corportation, 388 Market Street, Suite 750, San Francisco, CA, 94111, United States, jshang19@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan McKendall</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In the areas of power plant maintenance, it is essential to develop efficient techniques for relocating resources to new locations such that the cost is minimized. In this paper, it is defined as the crane sequencing problem (CSP). It is closely related to some variants of the traveling salesman problem. The CSP is a unique problem with many applications and is computationally intractable. In this paper, a mathematical model and hybrid ant systems are developed to solve CSPs.</br>
