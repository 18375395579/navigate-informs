<br>Title: Airline Crew Pairing is Solved</br><br>Author: Curt Hjorring, Senior Optimization Specialist, Jeppesen, Odinsgatan 9, Gothenburg, SE-411 03, Sweden, curt.hjorring@jeppesen.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The airline crew pairing has a long history in the OR literature.  I will provide an overview of the significant contributions.  I now believe that the basic crew pairing problem is solved so well  in practice that further algorithmic improvements will provide little  impact for production problems.  However, there are a number  of extensions and integrated problems for which benefits are  possible, and algorithmic improvements are needed.</br>
