<br>Title: On-line Calibration-based Integrated Operational Framework for Mass Evacuation</br><br>Author: Srinivas Peeta, Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, peeta@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu-Ting Hsu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose an operational framework for mass evacuation that integrates the three major aspects that shape an evacuation operation: demand, supply, and disaster. It is a stage-based framework where a rolling horizon approach is used to capture the dynamics of the evacuation network. An on-line calibration approach is developed in terms of evacuee behavior modeling. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate operational performance from both traffic and disaster management perspectives.</br>
