<br>Title: Agent-Based Modeling of Network Demand, Pricing, and Investment Dynamics</br><br>Author: Lei Zhang, Assistant Professor, Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, Oregon State University, 220 Owen Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331, United States, lei.zhang@oregonstate.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The welfare effects of road pricing depend on the decisions by users, owners, and regulators. Built on a novel travel demand and assignment model where each traveler is capable of learning and communicating, and has unique characteristics (e.g. value of time), this paper adopts consistent agent-based techniques to model the decision-making processes of those players and their interactions to address economic and policy analysis needs.</br>
