<br>Title: Unit-Performance-Reliability Based Optimization Model for Prioritizing Improvement Alternatives of a Mixed Traffic Network under Cost Constraint using Genetic-Algorithm</br><br>Author: Yanyan Chen, Professor, Beijing Transportation Engineering Key Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, No.100 Pingleyuan, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China, cdyan@bjut.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Heng Wei, Ying Liang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a method to prioritize the improvement alternatives for a mixed traffic roadway network given cost constraints.  Unit performance reliability, which describes the performance of a network link or intersection, is used to establish the objective of an optimization model that systematically maximizes the performance of the entire network.</br>
