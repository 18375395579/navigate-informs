<br>Title: Protection and Interdiction of Facilities: A Stochastic Model</br><br>Author: Federico Liberatore, PhD Student, Kent Business School, University of Kent, Canterbury, -, CT2 7WS, United Kingdom, fl51@kent.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Daskin, Paola Scaparra</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The objective of the Stochastic R-Interdiction Median Problem with  Fortification is to optimally locate defensive resources among  facilities in order to minimize the worst-case impact of a random  number of intentional disruptions of the facilities. A bound based  optimal algorithm and some heuristic-concentration type heuristics are  illustrated and compared.</br>
