<br>Title: Network Design for Two-echelon City Logistics System</br><br>Author: Claudio Sterle, PhD, University, Via Claudio, Napoli, 80125, Italy, claudio.sterle@unina.it</br><br>Coauthor(s): Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Antonio Sforza</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The freight distribution is one of the most challenging issue of the city logistics.   In this work we propose several formulations for a two-echelon city logistic system where we want to determine the number and locations of intermodal platforms and additional facilities, satellites, where freights are transferred and aggregated on small trucks, in order to minimize the effects of freight transportation in urban areas. We will also provide a discussion about possible solution approaches.</br>
