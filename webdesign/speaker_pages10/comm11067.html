<br>Title: Continuum Queuing Network Models in Aviation</br><br>Author: Kleoniki Vlachou, Ph.D. student, University of Maryland, 1173 Glen L. Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, kvlachou@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Lovell</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Numerous network queuing models have been developed to estimate the propagation of uncertainty in networks of airports. These models approximate networks with either low precision (stochastic models) or high precision (deterministic models). As new technologies are introduced in Air Traffic Management systems, intermediate precision cases must be examined. We explore the use of families of diffusion equations to solve these problems.</br>
