<br>Title: Socially Optimal Charging for Electric Vehicles</br><br>Author: Elena Yudovina, Postdoc, University of Michigan, Dept. of Statistics, 1085 South University Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, yudovina@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Michailidis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Electric vehicles have started entering different automotive markets. In order to bolster their adoption by consumers, a charging station infrastructure needs to be deployed. We study decentralized policies that assign electric vehicles to a network of charging stations with the goal of minimizing queueing. We establish the asymptotic social optimality of a proposed policy. The results provide insight on how to address questions related to the optimal location deployment of the infrastructure.</br>
