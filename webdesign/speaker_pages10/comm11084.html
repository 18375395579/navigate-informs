<br>Title: Towards More Realistic Mobile-Source Emissions Analysis via Dynamic Traffic Assignment</br><br>Author: Rohan Shah, Grad. Research Asst., The University of Texas at Austin, 301 E Dean Keeton Stop C1761, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, rohanshah@utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Levin, Nezamuddin N., Jennifer Duthie, Stephen Boyles</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Vehicular emissions models generally use time-aggregated or averaged traffic conditions in estimations. But in reality, traffic flows are essentially `dynamic', with network congestion locations, drivers' route choices and flow characteristics in general varying temporally, which can have significant implications on emissions. The study employs dynamic traffic assignment to account for them and implement more realistic emissions modeling in practice.</br>
