<br>Title: Impacts of Flight Cancellations on Delay Forecasting</br><br>Author: Michael Seelhorst, University of California, Berkeley, 1710 Delaware St., Berkeley, CA, 94703, United States of America, mseelhorst@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Flight cancellations are often the result of a complex decision process. Using historical flight information, we can infer the factors important by airlines in making these decisions. Using a deterministic queueing framework, we can then extend the investigation to the impact of cancellations on airline performance. In particular, we investigate flight delays. We find that delay forecasting measures can be off by 5-10% if cancellations are not accounted for.</br>
