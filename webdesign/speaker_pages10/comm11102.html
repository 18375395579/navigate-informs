<br>Title: Discrete-time Dynamic User Equilibrium Models</br><br>Author: Qipeng Phil Zheng, PhD student, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States of America, zqp@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Siriphong Lawphongpanich</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present models for determining dynamic user equilibrium flow distributions based on a discrete time horizon.  The models consider both route and departure time choices and rely on a time-expanded network.  Because time is discretized, it is possible that no flow distribution satisfies the traditional user equilibrium conditions.  When this occurs, we assume that users switch to a least-cost route only if doing so reduces their costs by a sufficiently large amount.</br>
