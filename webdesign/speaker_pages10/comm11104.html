<br>Title: Using Runway Assignment to Help Assess Aircraft Taxi-in Delay</br><br>Author: Derek Robinson, Operations Research Analyst, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC, 20591, United States of America, Derek.Robinson@faa.gov</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The objective of this study is to investigate aircraft taxi-in times at Core 30 airports. Most taxi-in analyses compare actual taxi times to a nominal time which only considers the airport and the operating carrier. We include runway assignment in our analysis. Using runway ends to determine the nominal taxi time can change the conclusions drawn from an assessment of those taxi times. In this investigation, we plan to compare delay results produced using both methods of defining a nominal time.</br>
