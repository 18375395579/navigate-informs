<br>Title: Practical Rolling Horizon Airport Slot Auction with Dynamic Quantities</br><br>Author: Andrew Churchill, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Maryland, 3117 AV Williams, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, churchil@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Lovell, Michael Ball</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose an innovative auction mechanism to distribute airport slots.  An annual auction is held to distribute a pool of slots.  The novelty lies in the application of an integer programming model to determine if slots should be added or removed from the pool each year.  These adjustments are undertaken to achieve model targets on the expected delays and cancellation rates.  Other features include an initial price-stabilization period and considerations for airport-specific requirements.</br>
