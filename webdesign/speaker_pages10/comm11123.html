<br>Title: Wired Versus Wireless Connectivity Problems</br><br>Author: Guy Kortsarz, Associate Professor, Rutgers - Camden, Camden, NJ, 08102, United States, guyk@camden.rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We survey some connectivity problems in wireless systems and compared them to their counterpart in wired systems. Two problems that are of particular interest. The first is: the b-cover problem. Given a graph G and a demand b(v) for every vertex, find a min-power (min-cost) subgraph G' such that degree_G'(v)\geq b(v) for every v. The second problem is that of finding a minimum power (cost) k-connected subgraph G' of G.</br>
