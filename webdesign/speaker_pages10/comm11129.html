<br>Title: A Fast Response Mechanism for Airspace Capacity Windfalls</br><br>Author: Andrew Churchill, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Maryland, 3117 AV Williams, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, churchil@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Lovell, Michael Ball</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a dynamic fast-response mechanism to help airspace users take advantage of unanticipated capacity opportunities in strategic en-route congestion management initiatives.   These types of programs would typically be triggered by the presence of severe weather in the en-route airspace.  User preference regarding alternate and preferred routings is incorporated, as are various realistic airspace constraints.</br>
