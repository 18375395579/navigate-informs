<br>Title: An Application of Reliability Analysis to Taxi-out Delay</br><br>Author: Tony Diana, Division Manager, NextGen Performance, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC, 20591, United States of America, Tony.Diana@faa.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Akira Kondo</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The research utilizes reliability analysis to evaluate any performance improvement in taxi-out delay at JFK resulting from taxiway enhancements in 2010. The study shows that the average taxi-out delay minutes declined by half in 2011 compared 2007. Weibull analysis of taxi-delay shows a reduction in the extreme value of delay from 30 to 15 minutes. Finally, reliability analysis can be used for airline practitioners to identify expected taxi-out delay and its variance as unimpeded values.</br>
