<br>Title: Bayesian Evaluation of Sensor Network Designs for Environmental Contaminants Monitoring</br><br>Author: Jianhua Xu, Doctoral candidate, Carnegie Mellon University, Dept. of Engineering and Public Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, jianhuax@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Johnson, Paul Fischbeck, Mitchell Small, Jeanne VanBriesen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The application of sensor networks to monitor environmental contaminants in water distribution networks has recently gained more attention. However, most of the research on designing senor networks assumes perfect sensors. In our research, we account for imperfect sensors and apply Bayesian belief networks to evaluate sensor networks.</br>
