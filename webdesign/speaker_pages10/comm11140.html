<br>Title: A MAC-layer Modification to Increase Ad-hoc Network Performance</br><br>Author: Aaron Phillips, Texas Tech University, Box 43061, Lubbock, Tx, United States of America, aaron.phillips@ttu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This is a proposed scheme to dynamically modify the Request To Send/Clear To Send mechanism of the MAC-Layer.  In this scheme, the retry limit settings are first evaluated for significance, then, through designed experimentation, they are chosen according to their performance at different mobile states.  These levels are then combined to create a dynamic mechanism that allows transmitting nodes to adjust their settings based on their own specific mobile states.</br>
