<br>Title: Extending the Basic Airline Crew Pairing Problem</br><br>Author: Johan Ivarsson, Jeppesen, Odingsgatan 9, Gothenburg, 411 03, Sweden, johan.ivarsson@jeppesen.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lennart Bengtsson, Curt Hjorring, Fredrik Altenstedt, Henrik Delin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We will look at two extensions to the crew pairing problem, which at first sight might not appear   related but may be addressed with the same technique, namely retiming and fly below rank.   Retiming is about changing the actual flight schedule in order to obtain a better solution,  whereas fly below rank is about letting a crew change to a more junior role temporarily.  The variable crewing extension will also be discussed briefly,   which addresses how to team crew together efficiently.</br>
