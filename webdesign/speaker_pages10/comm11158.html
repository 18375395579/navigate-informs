<br>Title: A Tolling Approach for Optimal Control of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles</br><br>Author: Jing Ma, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, majing@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chaoyue Zhao, Yongpei Guan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We first model a PHEV owner's optimal charging / discharging patterns as a shortest path problem and propose an algorithm to minimize the total cost for its daily activities. For a group of PHEVs which have impact on the real-time LMPs, we introduce a tolling mechanism to adjust the system's flows to optimal. Our tolling can improve the system performance by reducing congestion and abrupt demand patterns to the grid. The computational tests show encouraging results for the proposed approach.</br>
