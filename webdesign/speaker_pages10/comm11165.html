<br>Title: A New Modeling of the Gateway Airport Location Problem</br><br>Author: Mihiro Sasaki, Associate Professor, Nanzan University, 27 Seirei, Seto, 489-0863, Japan, mihiro@nanzan-u.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Takehiro Furuta, Atsuo Suzuki</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a new model to find the optimal gateway airport in a region. To establish a suitable airline network in a region such as Asia, we should take into account the interregional demand, i.e. the number of outgoing and inbound passengers from/to the region. The problem can be regarded as a hierarchical location problem. We show numerical results of the Asian gateway airport using OD data between Asia and Europe or North America evaluated by IATA in 2005.</br>
