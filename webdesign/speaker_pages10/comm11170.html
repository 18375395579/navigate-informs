<br>Title: Routing Vehicles in a Wafer Manufacturing Facility</br><br>Author: Kelly Bartlett, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr., Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, kelly.bartlett@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Junho Lee, Shabbir Ahmed, George Nemhauser, Byungsoo Na, Joel Sokol</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In a semiconductor manufacturing facility, rail-based vehicles transport wafers from machine to machine.  Because processing times are variable, the associated routing problem is an online optimization problem in a congested network.  We develop algorithms for vehicle selection and routing in order to minimize mean travel times and their variability and also to minimize travel time prediction errors.  We provide results from a simulated prototype facility.</br>
