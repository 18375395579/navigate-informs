<br>Title: Assessing Benefits from Aviation Capacity Investment: An Equilibrium Approach</br><br>Author: Bo Zou, University of California at Berkeley, 107E McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, zoubosoar@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This talk proposes an equilibrium approach to assess benefits from aviation infrastructure capacity investment. The equilibrium approach models the interplay among passenger demand, fare, flight frequency, and flight delays, and their responses to capacity expansion. We present component models, equilibrium formulation, solution algorithm, and the equilibration process, and compare benefit esitmates using the equilibrium and conventional approaches.</br>
