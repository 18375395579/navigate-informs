<br>Title: Scheduling Track Maintenance at CSX Transportation</br><br>Author: Kamalesh Somani, Manager Operations Research, CSX Transportation, 3019 Warrington Street, Jacksonville, FL, 32254, United States of America, Kamalesh_Somani@CSX.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fan Peng, Seungmo Kang, Yanfeng Ouyang, Xiaopeng Li</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: CSX performs around 200-300 scheduled track maintenance projects per year throughout its network. A maintenance project takes anywhere between one to twenty weeks. Different types of work are performed by different type of maintenance teams. We propose network flow models and solution algorithms to find a feasible and implementable schedule so as to minimize the total travel costs of all teams.</br>
