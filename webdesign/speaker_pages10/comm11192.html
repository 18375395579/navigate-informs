<br>Title: Vacant Taxi Driver Routing Behavior Learning Process</br><br>Author: Xianbiao Hu, Research Assistant, University of Arizona, 1209 E. 2nd Street, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, xbhu@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chang Chiu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a vacant taxi driver’s routing behaviour model, within which a taxi driver determines his/her optimal route based on the experience traffic condition and customer arrival rate, but also learn from the actual realization. By the end of day taxi driver gains actual experience about the traffic situation and customer distribution, compares it to the previous experience, then forms updated knowledge for the next day. Numerical convergence analysis demonstrates the property of such a learning process.</br>
