<br>Title: An Integrated Optimal Decision Model  for Ground Logistics and Air Cargo Scheduling</br><br>Author: Kwon Gi Mun, PhD Student, Rutgers Business School, #1009B, 1 Washington Park, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, kwongmun@eden.rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The mathematical model of two-tiered generalized scheduling problem has been formulated. Thus the optimal assignment solution between airports and facilities will be computed with the minimum transportation cost at the first stage. And then the minimum total cost will be calculated with the optimal routing solution of aircrafts. This research will use a mathematical model with practical constraints and real data.</br>
