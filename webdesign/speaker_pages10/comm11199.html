<br>Title: Simulation and Optimisation for Ambulance Logistics and Relocation</br><br>Author: Lei (Oddo) Zhang, University of Auckland, 70 Symonds Street, Auckland, N, New Zealand, min.oddo@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Meyer</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Two decision support products developed by Optima for Public Safety organizations are demonstrated; Siren Predict and Siren Live. Siren Predict is a simulation-based system used for strategic planning and accurately estimating operational performance. Siren Live is an optimization-based system for improving emergency response time by relocating idle vehicles in real-time. We present a new approach for ambulance relocation using Dynamic Programming, and show insights obtained from simple cases.</br>
