<br>Title: Next Generation Approach for Rolling Stock Scheduling Optimization</br><br>Author: Sami Gabteni, Senior Consultant, Jeppesen, Middlex Business Centre, Imm. Lumiere, 40 av. des Terroirs de France, Paris, 75012, France, sami.gabteni@jeppesen.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Traditional rolling stock scheduling optimizers reason at an elementary level: fleet units are assigned to scheduled tasks. We present the approach developed for the Danish State Railways (DSB), which handles compositions of units (consists) and sequences of tasks to capture the network dimension of the problem. Based on the evaluations performed by DSB, we will discuss the benefits of this approach, and the opportunities for other railways.</br>
