<br>Title: On-line Traveling Salesman with Duration and Distance Considerations</br><br>Author: Thibaut Vidal, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Room 32-D566, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, vidalt@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Jaillet</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider on-line traveling salesman problems in which the objective is to minimize a weighted sum of completion time and total travel distance. This objective captures both the customer-centric time-to-service objective and the carrier costs. On-line algorithms are examined, and new upper and lower bounds on competitive ratios are introduced.</br>
