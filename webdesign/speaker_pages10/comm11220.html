<br>Title: Applying AnyLogic Simulation Software to Flat Yard Analysis</br><br>Author: Roger Baugher, Director, BNSF Railway, 2600 Lou Menk Drive, Fort Worth, TX, 76131, United States of America, Roger.Baugher@BNSF.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: AnyLogic is a general purpose simulation tool enabling development of agent-based, system dynamics, and discrete-event models, in any combination.  Among the specialized libraries is the Rail Library that understands the railroad environment ?track, switches, trains, cars, coupling, routing, etc.  The software exploits the object-oriented framework provided by Java.  Using the tool, replay of activity at a flat yard will be demonstrated, and the features of the AnyLogic system discussed.</br>
