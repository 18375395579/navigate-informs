<br>Title: A Tabu Search Algorithm for the Single Vehicle Routing Allocation Problem</br><br>Author: John E. Beasley, Professor, CARISMA, Brunel University, Uxbridge, UB8 3PH, United Kingdom, john.beasley@brunel.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The single vehicle routing allocation problem involves deciding a route for a vehicle (starting and ending at given locations) such that it visits some customers. Customers not visited can either be allocated to their nearest customer on the route, or can be isolated; where the objective is to minimise a weighted sum of routing, allocation and isolation costs. Our tabu search algorithm includes aspiration, path relinking and diversification. Computational results are presented.</br>
