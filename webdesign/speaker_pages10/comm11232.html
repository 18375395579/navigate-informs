<br>Title: Dynamic Traffic Equilibrium Under Information: An Experimental Network Game Approach</br><br>Author: Gitakrishnan Ramadurai, Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, ramadg@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: User equilibrium behavior decisions are based on complete information of the network state. This is justified by two arguments: i) Users gain information traveling over the network repeatedly, and ii) ATIS can provide complete information about network state. In this paper, the above two arguments are examined. First, existence of equilibrium is investigated in a multi-player experimental game. Second, whether or not provision of real-time information aids in achieving equilibrium is tested.</br>
