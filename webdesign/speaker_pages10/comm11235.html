<br>Title: Analysis of Gate Hold Delays at the OEP-35 Airports (Summer 2007)</br><br>Author: Jianfeng Wang, PhD student, George Mason University, 4450 Rivanna Ln # 3727, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, jwang5@gmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lance Sherry, John F. Shortle, Juan Wang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: One of the congestion points in the air transportation system is the airport terminal gates. During operations with stochastic delays, an outbound flight may not be able to vacate its gate before the inbound flight arrives. This results in gate hold, delays, and/or gate changes. This paper presents a data analysis of gate hold delays at OEP-35 Airports.</br>
