<br>Title: A Decomposition Scheme for Bi-level Dynamic Network Design Problem</br><br>Author: Dung-Ying Lin, Graduate Research Assistant, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1761, ECJ Hall Suite 6.208, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, dylin@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ampol Karoonsoontawong, S. Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The bi-level dynamic network design problem is strongly NP-hard. Solving this problem efficiently is critical in the development of the capacity expansion policies on networks. A Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition based heuristic scheme is proposed to address this issue. Numerical experiments are performed, new solution methodologies are discussed, and insights are presented.</br>
