<br>Title: Heuristics for Fiber Installation in Optical Network Optimization</br><br>Author: Spyridon Antonakopoulos, Columbia University, 608 W 114 St, Apt 2A, New York, NY, 10025, United States of America, spyros@cs.columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Suppose we are given a fiber-optic network topology and a set of traffic demands, some of which may require protection against equipment failures. Our goal is to route all demands while minimizing the cost of optical components needed.  In this work, we define edge cost using sub-additive functions and reason why they closely model the optical component cost. Then, we present effective shortest-path based heuristics to route demands, where the choice of edge weights drives the optimization.</br>
