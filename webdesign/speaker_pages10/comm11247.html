<br>Title: A Tale of Two HPC Networks:  Evaluating Node Orderings for Torus and Dragonfly Topologies</br><br>Author: Carl Albing, Cray Inc., 380 Jackson Street, Suite 210, St. Paul, MN, 55101, United States of America, albing@cray.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: HPC application performance can vary in torus-based HPC systems. Node ordering is a way to factor topology into the placement decision to increase compactness. Several orderings have been proposed. What is the basis for choosing one ordering over others? A method is described for the static evaluation of a node ordering in a torus. Results provide visually compelling guidance on the choice of node ordering. A new dragonfly network is described and its implications for placement are discussed.</br>
