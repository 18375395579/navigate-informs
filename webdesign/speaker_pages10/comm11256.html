<br>Title: Optimal Maintenance Policies for a Safety-Critical System and its Deteriorating Sensor</br><br>Author: Chiel van Oosterom, PhD student, Eindhoven University of Technology, P.O. Box 513, Eindhoven, 5600MB, Netherlands, C.D.v.Oosterom@tue.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Maillart, Jeffrey Kharoufeh, Hao Peng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We formulate a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model for the integrated problem of optimally maintaining a deteriorating sensor and the safety-critical system it monitors. The sensor’s imperfect observations on the state of the system become less informative as the sensor ages. The system state can be identified perfectly by a costly site visit, which also provides an opportunity to replace the sensor.</br>
