<br>Title: Performance Evaluation of Alternative Continuous Descent Approaches</br><br>Author: Jens Brunner, TUM School of Management, Arcisstraﬂe 21, LS Tech Dienstl Oper Mgmt, Munich, 80333, Germany, Jens.Brunner@wi.tum.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elsayed Elsayed</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) is an important segment of an aircraft under the new NextGen air traffic system. We present a new formulation for the problem in order to minimize fuel consumption, emissions, noise and delays subject to assignment and separation constraints. We evaluate different CDA approaches, i.e. non/some/all aircrafts are CDA equipped. Computational results using real data show the efficiency of the modeling and the potential benefits of the CDA implementation.</br>
