<br>Title: Relationship Between En Route Delay and System Delay in the NAS</br><br>Author: Mark Hansen, Professor, University of California at Berkeley, Civil and Environmental Engineering, 114 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, mhansen@ce.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Helen Yin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: As air traffic increases, en route bottlenecks are becoming increasingly important factors in NAS operating performance. In cases where airports are also bottlenecks, the system effect of en route bottlenecks and the delays resulting from them depend on the details of their timing in relation to queuing conditions at the destination airport. We present a simple method for measuring the system effect of an en route delay and results of measurements using this method.</br>
