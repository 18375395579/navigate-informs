<br>Title: Formulation and Solution Approach of Railcar Classification and Connection in Hump Yards</br><br>Author: Mingzhou Jin, Associate Professor, The University of Tennessee at Knoxville, 405 East Stadium Hall, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States of America, jin@utk.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Haodong Li, Rui Song</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The hump sequencing and railcar connection in a railroad hump yard are considered together to minimize the total connection cost of priority-based railcars from inbound trains to outbound trains. The outbound trains are restricted by various size limitations, such as car number, length, and weight.  A heuristic method based on the harmony search is used. A case study shows that the first-come (first-depart) first-serve rule is not always optimal to hump inbound trains (form outbound trains).</br>
