<br>Title: Robust Shelter Location in Geographic and Building Environments</br><br>Author: Elise Miller-Hooks, Professor, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn L. Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, elisemh@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shabtai Isaac, Lei Feng, Reza Faturechi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A bilevel, integer stochastic program is presented for the robust shelter location problem in geographic and building environments. At the upper level, the optimal location and size of shelters is chosen to support evacuation given an event requiring building occupants or individuals in the region to seek egress or protective covering. Individuals choose egress routes to these safe locations in the lower level to minimize disutility (travel time, exposure, geometric considerations, ...).</br>
