<br>Title: Modeling Multiple Infrastructure Systems</br><br>Author: Srinivas Peeta, Professor, Purdue University, Civil Engineering, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN, 47907-2051, United States, peeta@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pengcheng Zhang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This presentation focuses on the analysis of multiple infrastructure systems from a holistic view using the system of systems framework. The interactions among the various systems are analyzed from spatial economics perspective under both equilibrium and dynamic disequilibrium settings. Application of proposed models in network design and infrastructure security problems is briefly discussed.</br>
