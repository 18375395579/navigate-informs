<br>Title: Analysis of Order Picking Performance using Decentralized Control Strategies in Facility Logistics</br><br>Author: Guido Follert, Department head, Fraunhofer IML, Jos.-v.-Fraunhofer Str. 2-4, Dortmund, 44227, Germany, Guido.Follert@iml.fraunhofer.de</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Companies are challenged to increase the performance of supply and distribution even on the level of physical material flow. Therefore, the use of decentralized control strategies seems promising. Various new approaches exist from decentralized control to autonomous vehicles to organize the flow of units in order picking. Implications from the combination of order picking and decentral control strategies are discussed and a methodology to identify suitable configurations is provided.</br>
