<br>Title: Optimal Dynamic Pricing Strategies for High-occupancy/Toll Lanes</br><br>Author: Yingyan Lou, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Florida, 365 Weil Hall, Box 116580, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, yingyan@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jorge Laval, Yafeng Yin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A self-learning approach is proposed to determine optimal pricing strategies for high-occupancy/toll lane operations. The approach learns recursively motorists' willingness to pay and specifies tolls to maximize the freeway's throughput while ensuring a superior travel service on the toll lanes. The impacts of the lane-changing behaviors on the flows are explicitly modeled by a multi-lane hybrid traffic flow theory. Insights on when to convert high-occupancy lanes to toll lanes are provided.</br>
