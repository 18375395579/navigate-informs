<br>Title: Equity Based Real Time Traffic Signal Control at Network Level using Historical Delay Information: An Application of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication</br><br>Author: H. M. Abdul Aziz, PhD Student, Purdue University, 150 Arnold Drive, Apt15, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, haziz@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The efficiency of signal control schemes are often evaluated based on aggregate system measures only. However, efficiency does not guarantee the equity (fairness) of the system. This research proposes a signal control scheme that assures fairness (in terms of experienced intersection delay due to signal control) across the users of the system. The signal control scheme uses the historical delay information along the entire trip of the users and we propose a vehicle-to-infrastructure communication based framework for its implementation in the real world.</br>
