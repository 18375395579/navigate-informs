<br>Title: A Stochastic Approach for Throughput Maximizing Advance Warning Sign Location</br><br>Author: Yi-Chang Chiu, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E. 2nd St., Tucson, AZ, United States, chiu@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Liang Zhou</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Advance warning signs are a common type of temporary traffic control device to alert motorists of upcoming roadway disturbances.  This paper discusses the possibility to improve work zone throughput through a careful selection of location of the first warning sign.  A stochastic model was developed to for this purpose.  Calibrated using simulated data, the model has shown to be effective in determining the placement of the first warning sign under various work zone entry traffic volumes.</br>
