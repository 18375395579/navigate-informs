<br>Title: Integrated Lot Sizing and Queuing Model for Truck Appointment System</br><br>Author: Xuesong Zhou, Assistant Professor, University of Utah, 122 South Central Campus Dr., Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States, zhou@eng.utah.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George List</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: An integrated lot-sizing and queuing model is developed to optimize truck appointment quotes over different time periods. A pointwise stationary fluid flow approximation method is embedded to describe time-dependent arrival rates and queue lengths for trucks with and without appointments at gates and yards. The presented model can be reformulated and efficiently solved as a dynamic network flow assignment with concave flow exit functions as side constraints.</br>
