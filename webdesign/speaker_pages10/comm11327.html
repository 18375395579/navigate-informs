<br>Title: Cost-based Cruise Linear Holding with Delay Recovery for ATFM</br><br>Author: Luis Delgado, Assistant Professor, Technical University of Catalonia, Esteve Terradas, 5, Room C3-120 PMT, Castelldefels, 08860, Spain, luis.delgado@upc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xavier Prats</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Cruise speed reduction can be used to absorb delay during the flight, in what can be considered a linear holding. With this strategy, it is possible to divide assigned delay between ground and air without incurring extra fuel consumption, with respect to the airline’s initial flight plan. With the suggested strategy, if the regulation is cancelled while a plane is airborne, part of this delay can be recovered.</br>
