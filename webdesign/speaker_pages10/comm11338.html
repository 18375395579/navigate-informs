<br>Title: Location-inventory Model with Milk-runs</br><br>Author: Leyla Ozsen, Purdue University, 315 Grant St, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, lozsen@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abdulrahman Alenezi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a Location-Routing-Inventory Model (LRIP) in which each chosen distribution center (DC) maintains safety stock for designated set of customers, each facing stochastic demand. Multiple customers can be served by one vehicle. The objective of the LRIP is to minimize location, routing, and inventory costs. We develop a two-phase heuristic, location- clustering first and routing second, to solve the LRIP. The first phase is formulated as a two-echelon location problem with risk-pooling.</br>
