<br>Title: The Destination-Loader-Door Assignment Problem for Cross-docking Facilities</br><br>Author: Ahmad Jarrah, Associate Professor, The George Washington University, Department of Decision Sciences, Washington, DC, 50052, United States of America, jarrah@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiangtong Qi, Jonathan Bard</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a model and solution procedure for a problem that arises in configuring transshipment hubs.  The first objective is to minimize the number of changes of destination-to-door assignments from one sort to the next.  The second and third objectives are to minimize the number of loaders and to evenly distribute the volume of packages assigned to each loader.  We strengthen the problem’s MIP formulation via effective cuts, and use preemptive optimization to obtain near-optimal solutions.</br>
