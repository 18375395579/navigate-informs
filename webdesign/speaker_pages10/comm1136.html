<br>Title: A Constraint-Programming Approach for Scheduling with Alternative Process Plans</br><br>Author: Andrew Davenport, IBM, IBM T.J.Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, PO Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States, davenport@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Manufacturing scheduling problems often involve jobs which can be scheduled using one of a number of different process routes through the manufacturing facility, as well as preferences on which process routes are selected. We present techniques and results for scheduling with alternative process routes using constraint programming approaches.</br>
