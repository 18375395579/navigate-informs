<br>Title: A Benders Decomposition Approach to Solving an Evacuation Problem</br><br>Author: J. Cole Smith, Associate Professor, University of Florida, ISE Department, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, cole@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): April Andreas</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Consider a network in which individuals are evacuated to a safe point.  Source nodes could represent offices, and the safe node could represent any point away from danger. We consider methods of modeling capacity and objectives, focusing on the minimization of the latest evacuation time. To capture evacuation dynamics, we examine a time-expanded network, and employ Benders decomposition using implied dual values to avoid directly solving optimization problems over the temporal dimension.</br>
