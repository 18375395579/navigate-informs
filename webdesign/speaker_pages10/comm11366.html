<br>Title: On Marginal Decision Rule in Day-to-Day Traffic Assignment</br><br>Author: Xiaozheng He, Research Associate, Purdue University, NEXTRANS Center, 3000 Kent Ave, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, seanhe@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a marginal decision rule based on the law of diminishing marginal utility to model traveler day-to-day route choice behavior. We investigate the relationship between the marginal decision rule and traveler?s rational and boundedly rational behaviors. A day-to-day traffic assignment model based on the marginal decision rule is explored in terms of the evolution of the traffic pattern towards the classical or boundedly rational user equilibrium cases.</br>
