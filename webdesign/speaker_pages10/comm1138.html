<br>Title: Integrated Supply Chain Design for Commodity Chemicals Production via Woody Biomass Fast Pyrolysis</br><br>Author: Yanan Zhang, Mechanical Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, yananz@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guiping Hu, Robert Brown</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study investigates the optimal production planning and facility locations for commodity chemicals production via woody biomass fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing. The locations and capacities of distributed preprocessing hubs and centralized biorefinery facilities are optimized by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. The objective is to maximize the net present value for a 20-years project based on this pathway. This approach is illustrated through a case study in Minnesota.</br>
