<br>Title: Sensor Management in Cyber Security</br><br>Author: Katie McConky, Research Scientist, CUBRC, Inc., 4455 Genesee St, Buffalo, NY, 14043, United States of America, mcconky@cubrc.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Kuhl, Moises Sudit, Ying Zhang, Rakesh Nagi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Currently, sensor management for cyber network security depends a lot on subjective experience. This may result in inaccurate decisions in many cases. Therefore, our research is dedicated to find a more objective way to conduct effective sensor management. We have develop both an a priori mathematical model to locate sensors based on initial knowledge and assumptions as well as a on-line approach to re-task sensors in the network as new information is obtained.</br>
