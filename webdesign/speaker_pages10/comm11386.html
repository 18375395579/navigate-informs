<br>Title: Maritime Tracking of Past Data</br><br>Author: Les Servi, Lincoln Laboratory Technical Staff, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, 244 Wood Street, Lexington, MA, 02420-9108, United States, servi@ll.mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Determining if a ship near a US port is friendly may require inferring the ship’s path during the past week. This can be done using insights from the image processing literature, e.g. Hough Transforms.  This talk will present an approach and demonstration, using simulated data, of this capability.</br>
