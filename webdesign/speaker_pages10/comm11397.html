<br>Title: The Evacuation Problem with Shared Information</br><br>Author: Lichun (Lisa) Chen, University of Maryland, Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, 1173 Glenn Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, lcchen@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elise Miller-Hooks</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a linear integer programming formulation of the time-dependent evacuation problem with shared information. The formulation includes constraints to preclude two evacuees from being given different directions at the same location and time. The problem is to determine the paths along which to send supply from multiple sources to a single sink such that the total time until all supply reaches the sink is minimized over a given time horizon and shared information constraints are respected. Travel times and capacities may vary with time. Solution techniques are proposed and NP-hardness of the problem is explored.</br>
