<br>Title: Considering Hazardous Materials Vehicles as a Terrorist Weapon: A Geographically Motivated Model</br><br>Author: Justin Yates, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, Dept of Industrial & Systems Engineering, College Station, TX, United States of America, jtyates@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rajan Batta, Chase Murray, Irene Casas</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Modeling various sensor parameters, detection capability within a geographic region is formulated as a bi-level integer program and integrated with a queuing schema that allocates limited interception resources responsible for alarm response.  A geographic information system is used to store, manipulate and display geographic and network data.  The presentation culminates with a case study examining the geographic region of Los Angeles County, California.</br>
