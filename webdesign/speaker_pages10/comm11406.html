<br>Title: Linearization Techniques for the p-Median Problem with Unreliable Facilities</br><br>Author: Serigne Gueye, Assistant Professor, University of Avignon, 339 chemin des Meinajariès, Agroparc BP 91228, Avignon, 84911, France, sgueye@zlc.edu.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mozart Menezes</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The p-Median problem with unreliable facilities consists in locating m unreliable facilities to n customers in such a way to minimize the expected cost of serving the customers. Each facility has a disruption probability, independent to the site location and to other facility. The problem is expressed as a bilinear program for which some linearization techniques are applied. Numerical tests are then performed.</br>
