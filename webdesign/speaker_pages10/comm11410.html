<br>Title: Revenue Management of Auto Train at Amtrak</br><br>Author: Soheil Sibdari, Assistant Professor, Charlton College of Business, University of Massachusetts, 285 Old Westport Road, North Dartmouth, MA, 02747, United States, ssibdari@umassd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kyle Lin, Sriram Chellappan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This study involves working with Amtrak, the national railroad passenger corporation, to develop a revenue management model. The RM department  provides the sales data of Auto Train, a service  that allows passengers to bring their vehicles on the train. We analyze the demand structure from sales data and build a mathematical model to describe the sales process for Auto Train. We further develop an algorithm to calculate the optimal pricing strategy that yields the maximum revenue.</br>
