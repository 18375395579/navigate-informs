<br>Title: Welfare-based Schedule Design and Fleet Assignment with an Application to a Norwegian Network</br><br>Author: Nicole Adler, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, 91905, Israel, msnic@huji.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joao Pita</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We evaluate the social welfare impact of a publicly supported air transportation network, such as the European PSO or the American EAS. The welfare based integrated flight schedule and fleet assignment optimization model designs a network whose objective is to increase accessibility to sparsely populated regions yet minimize public expenditure. The results distinguish between passenger, airline, airport and government surplus and are applied to the Norwegian PSO network.</br>
