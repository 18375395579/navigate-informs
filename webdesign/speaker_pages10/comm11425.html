<br>Title: Spatially-Distributed Make-to-Order System with Time-Sensitive Demand</br><br>Author: Robert Aboolian, California State University San Marcos, 333 S. Twin oaks Valley Road, San Marcos, CA, 92096, United States of America, raboolia@csusm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman, Dmitry Krass</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the problem of optimally locating a set of make-to-order facilities on a network where customer demand is time-sensitive. The objective is to determine the number, locations and capacities of facilities to maximize the overall profit.  Customers demand is a decreasing function of the travel distance and the expected waiting time at the facilities.</br>
