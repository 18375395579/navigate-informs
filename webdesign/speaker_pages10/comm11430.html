<br>Title: Solving the Min-max Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problem</br><br>Author: John Carlsson, Stanford University, 238 Ayrshire Farm Ct, apt. 201, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, johnnyc@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem is a  generalization of the Single-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem   in which vehicles start from multiple depots and return to their  depots of origin at the end of their assigned tours. The  traditional objective in MDVRP is to minimize the total length of  all the tours. We explore the notion of minimizing the maximal length of a tour in MDVRP (min-max MDVRP). A comparison of the computational implementations for different heuristics is included.</br>
