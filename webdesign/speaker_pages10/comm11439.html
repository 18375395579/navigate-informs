<br>Title: Joint Ambulance/Aeromedical EMS Coverage Models</br><br>Author: Rajan Batta, Professor/Associate Dean, SUNY at Buffalo, 412 Bonner Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, batta@eng.buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Rogerson, Alan Blatt, Marie Flanigan, Elif Tokar-Erdemir</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose location coverage models and solution methods for the problem of locating ambulances, aeromedical servers and landing zones. Coverage of a crash location can be obtained by sending only an ambulance, only a helicopter, or a combination of both ground and air EMS servers. We address uncertainty in accident locations by providing coverage to both accident points and regions (or paths). We illustrate the models on case studies using New Mexico traffic accident data.</br>
