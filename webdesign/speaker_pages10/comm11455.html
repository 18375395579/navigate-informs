<br>Title: Are the Low Cost Carriers More Efficient than the Full Service Airlines: Evidences from the US Airline Market</br><br>Author: Jia Yan, Assistant Professor, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China, lgtjiay@inet.polyu.edu.hk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Airlines provide differentiated services. For example, the services from the full service airlines (FSA) are different with the ones from the low cost carriers (LCC). The nature of product differentiation is ignored in the airline efficiency studies. This paper measures the airline efficiency by estimating a stochastic cost frontier model, which incorporates the multiple and differentiated outputs of the airlines.</br>
