<br>Title: A Novel Cooperative Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Signal Control Coordination</br><br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sukkusur@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): H. M. Abdul Aziz, Feng Zhu, Xinwu Qian</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study develops a novel cooperative Reinforcement Learning algorithm for coordinated signal control problem. Traffic signals are modeled as reinforcement learning agents with communication capabilities. A novel algorithm derived from Junction Tree Algorithm is proposed to obtain the best joint actions in the updating procedure of Q-values in the framework of cooperative reinforcement learning. Moreover, with minor changes, the algorithm is well suited to address the green wave traffic control problem. The algorithm is implemented and tested at a 3? grid network by utilizing a traffic simulator (VISSIM).</br>
