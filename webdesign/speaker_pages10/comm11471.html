<br>Title: A Congestion Pricing Problem with Embedded Mobile Source Emission Models</br><br>Author: Tao Yao, Pennsylvania State University, 349 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, taoyao@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ke Han, Hongcheng Liu, Terry Friesz</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: An emission model will be integrated into the  Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow model.    Aim of this work is to understand the impacts of network flow pattern and driving behavior on transportation emissions, as well as to exploit the engineering aspect of emission control.</br>
