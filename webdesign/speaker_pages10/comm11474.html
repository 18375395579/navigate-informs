<br>Title: On Activity-based Network Design Problems</br><br>Author: Jee Eun (Jamie) Kang, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Institute for Sustainable Transportation & Logistics University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, 409 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260-2050, United States of America, jeeeunka@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Will Recker, Joseph Chow</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper examines network design where OD demand is not known a priori, but is the subject of responses in household or user itinerary choices to infrastructure improvements. The bilevel formulation includes an upper level network design and shortest path problem while the lower level includes a set of disaggregate household itinerary optimization problems, posed as household activity pattern problem (HAPP) (or in the case with location choice, as generalized HAPP) models.</br>
