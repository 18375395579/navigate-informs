<br>Title: Network Characteristics of Current and Future Air Traffic Demand in the United States</br><br>Author: Dr. Banavar Sridhar, NASA Ames Research Center, Banavar.Sridhar@nasa.gov</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Air traffic is modeled as a network with several thousand nodes.  Several networks exhibit the “scale-free?property that as the network grows in size, a small number of components have a disproportionate influence on the successful operation of the network. This paper describes the network properties of the current air traffic system and uses future scenarios of air traffic growth to understand the performance of future air traffic networks.</br>
