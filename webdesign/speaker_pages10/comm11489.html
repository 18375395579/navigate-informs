<br>Title: Minimizing Maximum Link Utilization in OSPF Network</br><br>Author: Anusha Madhavan, Student, Southern Methodist University, 6425 Ownby Drive, Room 356, Dallas, TX, 75205, United States, amadhava@engr.smu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeffery Kennington</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a popular internet routing protocol. One of the main challenges in routing data is to minimize the maximum link utilization in order to limit the congestion in a network. In this investigation, we present an arc-path column generation procedure and a modified arc-path optimization model with an objective of minimizing link congestion. An empirical analysis and comparison of the node-arc version and our arc-path procedure is also presented.</br>
