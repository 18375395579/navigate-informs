<br>Title: Diverge Models and Dynamic Traffic Equilibria</br><br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, 301 E Dean Keeton St Stop C1761, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christopher L. Melson, Jennifer C. Duthie, Tarun Rambha</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: While dynamic traffic assignment models are known to exhibit multiple equilibria, we present a particularly pathological instance in which every feasible assignment is a user equilibrium, but in which the system optimum is unique, and show that the price of anarchy in this instance is unbounded.  Practical implications of this phenomena are discussed, along with the use of piecewise-linear fundamental diagrams as one potential resolution.</br>
