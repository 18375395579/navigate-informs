<br>Title: Loops and the Existence of Traffic Tolls</br><br>Author: Jane Hagstrom, Professor, University of Illinois at Chicago, Dept. of Information & Decision Sciences, 601 S. Morgan, (MC 294), Chicago, IL, 60607, United States, hagstrom@uic.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Abrams</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Given desired feasible flows in a multi-commodity traffic network, we provide a characterization in terms of loops of the conditions under which commodity-independent tolls exist to enforce those flows.  Such tolls exist if and only if the flow contains no removable single- or multiple-commodity loop in the sense of Gallager (1977).</br>
