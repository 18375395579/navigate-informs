<br>Title: Joint Location and Dispatching Decisions for Emergency Medical Services</br><br>Author: Hector Toro-Diaz, Clemson University, 204 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, htoro@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maria Mayorga, Sunarin Chanta, Laura McLay</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Reducing ambulance response time saves lives. We propose a joint location and dispatching model aimed to minimize the Mean System Response Time (MRT), and a solution procedure based on Genetic Algorithms (GA). The commonly used fixed a-priori dispatching rule sending the closest ambulance has shown to be effective in minimizing the MRT across a variety of different system’s characteristics.</br>
