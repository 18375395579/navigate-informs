<br>Title: A Location-allocation Problem with Concentric Circles</br><br>Author: Jack Brimberg, Professor, Royal Military College, Kingsrton, ON, Canada, jack.brimberg@rmc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zvi Drezner</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Consider a problem where a set of fixed points (customers) in the continuous plane is given and each of these points has an associated positive weight (or demand). The objective is to locate p concentric circles and allocate the fixed points to them in order to minimize the sum of weighted distances from the fixed points to their closest circles. This new model is described, its properties examined, and heuristic solution methods are proposed. Applications of the model are explored.</br>
