<br>Title: Benefit Estimation in Presence of Demand Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Dipasis Bhadra, Principal Economist, MITRE/CAASD, 7515 Colshire Avenue, McLean, VA, 22102, United States, dbhadra@mitre.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dave Knorr</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Estimation of future benefits from federal programs designed to improve air transportation infrastructure using deterministic or point forecasts could be misleading in presence of uncertainty. Uncertainty rooted in airlines decisions, for example, make the forecasts at the airports very difficult, especially in the short run. We offer a framework where demand uncertainties can be incorporated in benefit estimation. We illustrate this framework by using an FAA investment program.</br>
