<br>Title: Power System Dynamics as Primal-dual Algorithm for Optimal Load Control</br><br>Author: Steven Low, California Institute of Technology, MC 305-16, Pasadena, CA, United States of America, slow@caltech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Changhong Zhao, Ufuk Topcu, Na Li</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We formulate an optimal load control (OLC) problem in power networks, where the objective is to minimize the aggregate cost of tracking an operating point subject to power balance over the network. We prove that the system dynamics coupled with frequency-based load control serve as a primal-dual algorithm to solve OLC. This result implies that the local bus frequencies convey the right information for the loads to make individual decisions, which allows a decentralized solution.</br>
