<br>Title: A Simulation based Approach for Estimating Public Investment in US Freight Infrastructure</br><br>Author: Yuntao Guo, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, School of Civil Engineering, West Lafayette, In, 47907, United States of America, guo187@purdue.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study incorporates risk in total cost analysis to evaluate the public investment in US freight transportation infrastructure, in particular, the investment to support two competitive modes of freight transportation, long-haul trucking transportation and rail-truck intermodal transportation. A comparison between deterministic and risk based cost-benefit analysis provides insightful results on the economic and financial implications for the public interests.</br>
