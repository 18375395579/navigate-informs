<br>Title: A Single Facility Location Model for Retail Networks under Demand Substitution</br><br>Author: Hong Suk Yang, School of Business, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-742, Korea, Republic of, hongsuk@snu.ac.kr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hojung Shin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The conventional location problem with a hierarchy of service facilities tries to obtain the maximum coverage of population or geographical space. In this problem, each demand point is assigned to a certain member of the hierarchy within an appropriate distance. It is often implied that the closer the facilities are to the existing demand points, the better the public welfare (or service) provided. However, the traditional set-covering approach often neglects a fact that companies may strategically locate their new facility closer to competition in order to capture the competitors?market share. Thus, we propose a single facility location model whose goal is to find the optimal size and location of facility, considering both demand cannibalization among the same company’s retail outlets and demand substitution among those of competitors. The model is developed using integer programming and tested upon the real data from the two major pizza chains in Korea.</br>
