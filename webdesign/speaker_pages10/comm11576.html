<br>Title: Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Coordinated Traffic Signals</br><br>Author: Henry X. Liu, Associate Professor, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, henryliu@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jie Sun</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Shortest path problem (SPP) is important to many applications in ITS and has been studied extensively in the literature. However, little attention has been paid to the SPPs within a signalized traffic network, especially with coordinated traffic signals. In this talk, we will discuss a shortest path search algorithm that will consider traffic signal coordination parameters. The model is tested using the real-world data collected from the City of Pasadena in California.</br>
