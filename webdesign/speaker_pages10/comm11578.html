<br>Title: An Analytical Tool for Characterization of Productivity and Quality Issues in IT Services</br><br>Author: Victor Cavalcante, IBM Research, Rod. Jornalista F. Aguirre Proença, km 09 (SP101) Chácaras Assay, Hortolândia, SP, 13186-900, Brazil, victorfc@br.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rogério Paula, Carolina Andrade, Claudio Pinhanez, Cleidson de Souza, Ana Appel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This work describes an analytical tool to evaluate the performance and quality of incident management (IM) systems in IT service factories. Based on the normalization of ticket assignment delay and resolution time by their respective service-level agreement, the method computes and plots the spreading of ticket data on a log-log chart. By comparing the actual and desired distribution values in specific areas, the method diagnoses specific problems and issues in the performance of IM systems.</br>
