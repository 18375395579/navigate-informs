<br>Title: A Methodology to Select Between Fixed and DRT Services: Critical Demand Density</br><br>Author: Luca Quadrifoglio, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, CE/TTI Bldg., Room 301I, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, lquadrifoglio@civil.tamu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In the transit business, planners often struggle when having to decide what type of transit service to put in place in a given area. This is because the balance between operating costs and service quality is frequently hard to evaluate and so is the choice between a fixed-route or demand responsive type of service, especially within residential areas with lower and sparser demand. We are proposing a simulation analysis to address the problem.</br>
