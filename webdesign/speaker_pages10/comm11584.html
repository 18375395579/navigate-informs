<br>Title: Vehicle Routing for a Just-In-Time Production System</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Ohlmann, Assistant Professor, University of Iowa, S372 Pappajohn Business Building, Iowa City, IA, 52242- 199, United States, jeffrey-ohlmann@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Fry, Barrett Thomas</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of routing a fleet of vehicles to make pickups from a network of suppliers in a lean production system. The pursuit of low work-in-process inventory and production smoothing throughout the system introduces complicating side constraints creating a vehicle routing problem with time windows and split deliveries. We present a heuristic approach and compare results obtained via common frequency routing to those obtained via general frequency routing.</br>
