<br>Title: Intermodal Freight DTA Platform: Application to Evaluation of New Services in European Corridor</br><br>Author: Hani Mahmassani, Professor, The University of Maryland at College Park, Department of Civil & Environmental Engi, College Park, MD, 20742-3021, United States, masmah@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): April Kuo, Chung-Cheng Lu, Rahul Nair, Jing Dong, Elise Miller-Hooks, Kuilin Zhang, Vishnu Arcot</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: New rail and intermodal services in a European corridor are evaluated using a dynamic simulation-based freight network assignment model, that incorporates mode and intermodal service choice along with path assignment.  The simulation captures terminal delays which feed back to the shipper decisions to compute an equilibrium solution where appropriate.</br>
