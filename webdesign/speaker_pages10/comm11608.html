<br>Title: Large Scale Crew Rostering- A Combined Local Search and Column Generation Approach</br><br>Author: Tomas Gustafsson, Head of Optimization, Jeppesen, Jeppesen Systems AB | PO Box 192, Goteborg, 411 03, Sweden, tomas.gustafsson@jeppesen.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hamid Kharraziha</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Large scale weighted fair share crew rostering problems are in them selves very challenging to solve. If you add the requirement that the approach should work for more or less any airline without significant changes, the challenge increase dramatically. We will describe the current Jeppesen approach in production with many major airlines and discuss further ideas to increase performance.</br>
