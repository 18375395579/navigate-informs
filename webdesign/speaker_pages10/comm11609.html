<br>Title: Scheming the Postal Service: An Algorithm for Delivery Point Sequencing</br><br>Author: Mariah Jeffery, IBM Global Business Services, 12902 Federal Systems Park Dr, Fairfax, VA, 22033, United States, mjeffery1@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mariah Jeffery</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We discuss the development of a tool for creating sort schemes for the United States Postal Service’s Delivery Point Sequencing (DPS) operation. The tool uses a polynomial time algorithm to assign mail to DPS machines for sorting with an objective of minimizing the total equipment required while meeting service standards.</br>
