<br>Title: Evaluation of Countermeasures to Secure Cargo at Southwestern Ports of Entry</br><br>Author: Niyazi Bakir, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Southern California, 3710 Mc Clintock Ave, Room 322, Los Angeles, CA, 90034, United States of America, nbakir@usc.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study examines security issues pertaining to Mexican commercial truck crossings at US borders. We propose a model that examines risks at various phases of container movement beginning with customs processing at the Mexican side of the border and including inspection of cargo at U.S. customs ports. We model container movement using decision tree analysis and explore cost effectiveness of countermeasures given the potential benefits of reduced likelihood of a successful terrorist attack.</br>
