<br>Title: Second Prize: An Algorithm for Railway Crew Rescheduling</br><br>Author: Daniel Potthoff, PhD Student, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Econometric Institute, PO Box 1738, Rotterdam, ZH, 3000DR, Netherlands, potthoff@few.eur.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dennis Huisman, Guy Desaulniers</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: On the Dutch railway network, there are daily about 20 disruptions. In this paper, we present an algorithm to reschedule the crew when such a disruption occurs. The algorithm is based on column generation techniques combined with Lagrangian heuristics. Since the number of duties is in practical instances very large, we first define a core problem of tractable size which has a high chance to deliver a good rescheduling solution. Then the algorithm performs a limited number of large neighborhood search steps to improve the solution.</br>
