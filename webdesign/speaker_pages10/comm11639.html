<br>Title: Evaluation of Urban Chemical Disaster Emergency Evacuation Strategies</br><br>Author: Scott Parr, Student, Florida Atlantic University, 777 Glades Road, Boca Raton, FL, 33431, United States of America, sparr1@fau.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A subsection area of a major metropolitan area was simulated using the software program AIMSUN in order to test emergency evacuation techniques employed by the city and state localities. This is due to the high level risk of man made disastrous eventualities.  The goal of this project focuses on the development of a traffic simulation model in order to integrate an emergency preparedness plan in order to effectively determine the best strategies to use for evacuation.</br>
