<br>Title: A Dynamical System based Formulation to Represent the Day-to-Day Dynamics of Transportation Network</br><br>Author: Amit Kumar, Purdue University, NEXTRANS, 3000 Kent Ave, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, kumar44@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Peeta</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a dynamical system based model to represent the evolution of path flows resulting from the day-to-day dynamics in the state of disequilibrium of transportation network under static demand. The proposed model is based on the proportional-switch adjustment process and is derived using insights from the multi-commodity economic market. The solution methodology is discussed and computational results are presented for a study network.</br>
