<br>Title: A Simulation-based Optimization Algorithm for Dynamic Urban Transportation Problems</br><br>Author: Carolina Osorio, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 1-232, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, osorioc@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Linsen Chong</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a simulation-based optimization (SO) algorithm to address continuous generally constrained dynamic urban transportation problems. The algorithm is based on a metamodel that combines performance estimates from a stochastic traffic simulator with those from a macroscopic traffic mo</br>
