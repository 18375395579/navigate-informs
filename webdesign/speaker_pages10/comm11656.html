<br>Title: System Optimum Assignment of Wireless-Equipped Assets: Problem Variations and Solution</br><br>Author: Natalia Ruiz Juri, natiruizjuri@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This work explores the marginal cost of routing wireless-equipped assets into a stochastic network, as a means to analyze and quantify information availability impacts on total system expected cost. Optimization models are proposed for several problem variations, involving different assumptions and objectives. Solution algorithms are developed and tested in a number of example networks. The result analysis provides useful insights about the problem significance and complexity.</br>
