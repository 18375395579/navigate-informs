<br>Title: Using Knowledge Sharing in Organizational Social Networks to Improve Service Delivery</br><br>Author: Su Dong, Student, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, 9201 University City Blvd, Friday, Charlotte, NC, 28223, United States of America, sdong1@uncc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Monica Johar, Ram Kumar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper illustrates how knowledge sharing in organizational social networks can be used to enhance service delivery. We present an integer-programming model in which employees can use their social networks to acquire knowledge required to complete service-related tasks. A simulation-based heuristic is used to solve this problem. Our model can be used to study the impact of different network structures and task assignment strategies on organizational performance, and knowledge diffusion.</br>
