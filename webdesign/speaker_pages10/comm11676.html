<br>Title: Simultaneous Train Rerouting and Rescheduling on an N-track Network</br><br>Author: Xuesong Zhou, University of Utah, MCE Building 2135, 110 S. Central Campus Dr., Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States of America, xzhou99@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research develops a cumulative flow count based integer programming formulation for the problem of train dispatching on an N-track network, by means of simultaneously rerouting and rescheduling trains. The track capacities are modeled as side constraints and further dualized through a Lagrangian relaxation solution framework. The original complex problem is then decomposed into a sequence of single train rerouting/rescheduling subproblems.</br>
