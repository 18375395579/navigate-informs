<br>Title: A Simulation Based Location of Acoustic Sensors in a Data Fusion Capable Environment</br><br>Author: Rajan Batta, University at Buffalo (SUNY), Dept of Industrial & Systems Engg, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, batta@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Blatt, Kevin Majka, Marie Flanigan, Tejswaroop Geetla</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In an advanced road system filled with intelligent sensors, we believe that a distributed network of acoustic sensors plays a major role in incident detection and accident characterization. This work looks at the placement of acoustic sensors in a data fusion capable environment to better characterize an incident.</br>
