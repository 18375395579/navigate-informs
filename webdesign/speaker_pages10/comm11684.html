<br>Title: Routing Optimization with Deadlines under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Jin Qi, qijin@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Melvyn Sim, Patrick Jaillet</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a routing problem with deadlines imposed at a given subset of nodes, and uncertain arc travel times characterized by distributional information set. By introducing a new measure named Lateness Index to evaluate the performance of meeting deadlines, we show that the special case, in which only one node has a deadline requirement, is polynomially solvable. Moreover, for the general case, we could find exact optimal routing policy by only solving a series of deterministic routing problems.</br>
