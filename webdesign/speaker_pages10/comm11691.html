<br>Title: Large-scale Contiguous Geographic Clustering</br><br>Author: Ahmad Jarrah, Assistant Professor, Department of Management & Marketing, College of Business, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, 82072, United States of America, jarrah@uwyo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Bard</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The focus of this problem class is that of partitioning a region into geographically contiguous sub-areas while optimizing an objective measure and adhering to capacity constraints.  The motivating application is that of large pickup-and-delivery networks involving thousands of loads each day.  Modeling paradigms, solution schemes and computational experiences are discussed.</br>
