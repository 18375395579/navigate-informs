<br>Title: Advances in Land Search and Rescue Theory Applications</br><br>Author: Robert Koester, CEO, DBS Productions, PO Box 1894, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States of America, robert@dbs-sar.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The cornerstone of search theory is the correct use of Probability of Containment and Probability of Detection. Using the recently established International Search and Rescue Incident Database, new models capable of detailed allocation of Probability of Containment within the search area have been developed. In addition, on going experiments are establshing effective sweep width values in the highly variable ground environment.</br>
