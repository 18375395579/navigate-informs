<br>Title: Heuristics for the Location Routing Problem with Intermediate Storage Facilities</br><br>Author: Stephen Hill, Ph.D Candidate, The University of Alabama, Box 870226, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487, United States, shill@cba.ua.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Mittenthal</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this work we discuss the characteristics of and potential solution approaches for the Location Routing Problem with Intermediate Storage Facilities.  We present several heuristic approaches to generate high-quality solutions to the problem.</br>
