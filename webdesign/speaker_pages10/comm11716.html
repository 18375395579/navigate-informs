<br>Title: Locomotive Planning and Real-time Assignment Models at CSX Transportation</br><br>Author: Ravindra Ahuja, President, Innovative Scheduling, Inc., GTEC, 2153 SE Hawthorne Road,, Suite, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, ahuja@ufl.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We have been partnering with CSX Transportation to develop several locomotive-related  models. These models include: Locomotive Planning Optimizer (which determines an optimal locomotive plan), Locomotive Simulation Optimizer (which simulates the locomotive movement across the railroad network), and Real-Time Locomotive Shop Router (which sends locomotives to shops for quarterly maintenances). This presentation will give an overview of these models and their computational results.</br>
