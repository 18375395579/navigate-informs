<br>Title: Innovative Operating Strategies for Para-transit Services</br><br>Author: Luca Quadrifoglio, Texas A&M University, CE/TTI Bldg. - Room 301-I, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, lquadrifoglio@civil.tamu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A significant inefficiency of ADA Paratransit services using zoning strategies is related to the large amount of empty trip miles driven for serving cross-zonal customers. We explore innovative strategies for operating them by enabling providers to serve both trips of these customers in need of round trip rides and quantify the benefits in terms of a significant reduction of the empty trip miles and an improvement of the level of service. We investigate both static and dynamic scenarios.</br>
