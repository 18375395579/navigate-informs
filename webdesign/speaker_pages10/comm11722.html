<br>Title: Sequential Traffic Flow Decision Making with En route Weather Constraints</br><br>Author: Dr. Shon Grabbe, Research Scientist, NASA, Mail Stop: 210-10, Moffett Field, CA, 94035, United States of America, Shon.R.Grabbe@nasa.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dr. Banavar Sridhar, Dr. Avijit Mukherjee</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A hierarchical, sequential traffic flow management approach is proposed for assigning pre-departure delays, tactical reroutes, and airborne holding to flights impacted by en route weather constraints.  The results are presented in terms of system-level delays, throughput, and variations in airspace complexity.</br>
