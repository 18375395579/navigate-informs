<br>Title: Network Topology and the Global Effectiveness of Decentralized Road Pricing Strategies</br><br>Author: Lei Zhang, Assistant Professor, Oregon State University, School of Civil & Construction Engineering, 220 Owen Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331, United States of America, imleich@yahoo.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers a particular scenario of road pricing where a number of decentralized agents set toll rates according to independent non-cooperating objectives. Pricing games between multiple private roads or between local jurisdictions are real-world examples of this decentralized network pricing scenario. The global effectiveness of decentralized decisions, defined at the system level, is examined for networks with various topologies (e.g. grid, hub-spoke, ring, scale-free, and hybrid).</br>
