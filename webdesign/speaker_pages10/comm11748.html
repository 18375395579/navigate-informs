<br>Title: A Stochastic Macroscopic Model of Traffic Flow: Gaussian Approximation, Probabilistic Properties, and Estimation</br><br>Author: Saif Jabari, University of Minnesota, 500 Pillsbury Drive SE, Dept of Civil Engineering, Minneapolis, MN, 55414, United States of America, jabar005@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Henry Liu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This research develops a Gaussian model of macroscopic traffic flow with time varying mean and covariance functions, which are given explicitly.  We discuss the derivation of the model, its probabilistic behavior, and numerical schemes for computing traffic flow dynamics with applications to real-time estimation.</br>
