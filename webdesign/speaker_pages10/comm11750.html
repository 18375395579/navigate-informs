<br>Title: q-Ad-hoc Hub Assignment due to Hub Outages</br><br>Author: Hyun Kim, Assistant Professor, University of Tennessee, Department of Geography, 1000 Philip Fulmer Way, Knoxville, TN, 37996, United States of America, hkim56@utk.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Megan Ryerson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: If an outage occurs at a hub, transferring goods will be impeded unnecessarily. A recovery strategy could be the utilization of alternative hubs in an ad-hoc manner; this is, in essence, reverse network interdiction. We propose the q-Ad-hoc hub assignment model to re-organize the spatial structure of a disrupted hub network with unaffected hubs serving as ad-hoc replacement hubs and the establishment of alternative routes connecting supply and demand nodes with the ad-hoc ports.</br>
