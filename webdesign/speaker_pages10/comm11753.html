<br>Title: Differentiated Congestion Pricing of Urban Transportation Networks</br><br>Author: Mahmood Zangui, University of Florida, mzangui@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin, Siriphong Lawphongpanich</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper explores a new type of congestion pricing that differentiates users with respect to their travel characteristics and charges them different amount of toll accordingly. The scheme can reduce the financial burden of travelers or lead to more substantial reduction of congestion. Given that the scheme requires tracking travelers, methods are proposed to mitigate the potential privacy concern or provide incentives for travelers to voluntarily reveal their private travel information.</br>
