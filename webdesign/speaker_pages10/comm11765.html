<br>Title: Logistics Planning for Restoration of Network Connectivity After a Disaster</br><br>Author: Sibel Salman, Koc University, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, Sariyer, Istanbul, 34450, Turkey, ssalman@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ayse Nur Kibar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: After a disaster, damaged roads should be repaired/unblocked by a fleet of machinery initially positioned in a depot to restore highway connectivity. We define a selective arc routing problem to find the walk of k vehicles with minimum time to reach connectivity. We provide a flow-based mixed integer programming model. We consider Istanbul’s highway and determine the number of machinery and their initial locations under different road damage scenarios for earthquake preparedness.</br>
