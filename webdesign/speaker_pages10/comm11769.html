<br>Title: Re-acquisition of Lost Mobile Targets using a Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</br><br>Author: Daniel Pack, US Air Force Academy, USAFA, CO, 80840, United States of America, Daniel.Pack@usafa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hyukseong Kwon</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Tracking a mobile ground target using a small UAV with a camera sensor is a challenging task due to the limited sensor field of view (FOV).  The focus of the current work is to exploit the interplay between sensing and control of a small UAV to maximize the likelihood of keeping mobile targets within the sensor FOV and re-capturing them, if the targets are lost.  We show an optimization method by incorporating UAV dynamics, estimates of mobile target states, and the camera sensor models.</br>
