<br>Title: Mixed Route Strategies for Transporting Hazardous Materials</br><br>Author: Michael Bell, Professor, Imperial College, Exhibition Road, London, UK, SW7 2BU, United Kingdom, m.g.h.bell@imperial.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Urszula Kanturska</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The shipment of hazardous materials commonly focuses on identifying a single safest route between a pair of points. We demonstrate that for repeated shipments, where there is uncertainty about link incident probabilities, the safest strategy is to use a mix of routes. The optimality conditions are explored and a solution algorithm suitable for use with standard traffic assignment software is presented.</br>
