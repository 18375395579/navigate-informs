<br>Title: A Route Demand Model for Air Passenger Transportation: Implications and Applications</br><br>Author: Chieh-Yu Hsiao, University of California at Berkeley, 107D McLaughlin Hall, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, cyhsiao@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Hansen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This research proposes a route demand model, which simultaneously deals with city-pair trip generation and route choice, for air passenger transportation in hub-and-spoke network. The empirical findings, including implications of estimated results and applications for policy experiments are discussed based on the case study of the National Airspace System of the United States.</br>
