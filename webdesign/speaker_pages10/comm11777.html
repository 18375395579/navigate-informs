<br>Title: Schedule-based Transit Assignment Using a Bush-based Approach</br><br>Author: Mark Hickman, Associate Professor, University of Arizona, 1209 E. Second Street, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States of America, mhickman@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hyunsoo Noh</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Considering a congested transit network with passenger boarding priority, we propose a schedule-based transit assignment using bush-based approach. The proposed model is applied on a link-based transit schedule network, assuming either deterministic or stochastic passenger behavior. Stochastic behavior is represented with the entropy term for each path. For the solution, an algorithm using a diagonalization technique is utilized.</br>
