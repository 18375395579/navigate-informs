<br>Title: The Generalized Regenerator Location Problem</br><br>Author: S. Raghavan, University of Maryland, 4345 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742-1815, United States of America, raghavan@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ivana Ljubic, Si Chen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In the generalized regenerator location problem (in optical networks) we are given a set of terminal nodes T that need to communicate. It is necessary to install regenerators if the distance between a pair of nodes in T is greater than L. Regenerators can only be installed at a subset of nodes in the network. We wish to minimize the number of regenerator (or a weighted combination). We describe heuristics for the problem, and an MIP model, and our computational experiences with both.</br>
