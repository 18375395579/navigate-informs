<br>Title: Market Equilibria and Cell-Breathing for Wireless LAN</br><br>Author: Vahab Mirrkoni, Researcher, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, United States, mirrokni@microsoft.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A major issue in wireless LAN is the problem of distributed load balancing. Similar to ideas of market equilibria, we propose Cell Breathing as a load balancing mechanism for power assignment of access points in a wireless LAN.  These distributed power assignment algorithms ensure the optimal use of the capacity of the network.  We analyze our algorithms both theoretically and empirically, and observe that it outperforms the existing algorithms.</br>
