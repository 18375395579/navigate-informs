<br>Title: Flight Trajectory Optimization</br><br>Author: Srinivas Bollapragada, Principal Scientist, General Electric, 1 Research Circle, K1-4A50A, Niskayuna, NY, 12309, United States of America, bollapragada@ge.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We developed and implemented a novel algorithm to control the trajectory of a flight to reduce the costs incurred. Our algorithm computes near-optimal values for the parameters to be entered into an aircraft’s flight management system to minimize the fuel and schedule adherence costs incurred on the flight. We implemented our algorithm in a prototype software system that is currently in use at GE Aviation Services.</br>
