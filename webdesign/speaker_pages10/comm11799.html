<br>Title: Optimizing School District Lines and Bus Routes Using GIS: The Case of Sweet Home School</br><br>Author: Irene Casas, University at Buffalo, 125 Wilkeson Quad, Buffalo, NY, 14260-2050, United States, icasas@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rakesh Nagi, Deelesh Mandloi, Rajan Batta, Robert Garrity</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider redistricting four elementary schools and designing bus routes with the support of an integrated geographic information system (GIS) and optimization environment. The objective is to minimize travel distances/transportation cost, but also balancing socio-economic factors (diversity) under school and bus capacity constraints. A western NY case will be discussed.</br>
