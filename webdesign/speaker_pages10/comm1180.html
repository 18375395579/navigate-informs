<br>Title: Hub Location with Isolated Hubs</br><br>Author: James Campbell, Professor, University of Missouri-St. Louis, College of Business Administration, One University Blvd., St. Louis, MO, 63121-4499, United States of America, campbell@umsl.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Hub facilities are used in transportation networks to provide a transshipment, sorting and consolidation function. This paper considers multiple allocation hub median and hub arc location problems with connected hubs, that are adjacent to reduced cost hub arcs, and isolated hubs, that are not adjacent to any hub arcs.  Service levels are imposed by limiting the maximum travel distance via hubs for each origin-destination pair.</br>
