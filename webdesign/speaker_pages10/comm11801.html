<br>Title: Robust Network Interdiction with Invisible Interdiction Assets</br><br>Author: N. Orkun Baycik, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, nobaycik@email.uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kelly Sullivan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In the shortest path network interdiction problem, a leader seeks to maximize the length of a follower’s path through the network by interdicting (or lengthening) arcs. Most studies of this problem are based on the assumption that the leader’s actions are visible to the follower. We seek to find a placement of invisible interdictions robust against the possibility that some of the interdictions may become visible.  We present a solution approach for this problem and a brief computational study.</br>
