<br>Title: Airport Capacity and Delay Assessment for RJ Fleet Upgauging Options</br><br>Author: Alexander Klein, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, United States, aklein1@gmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jianfeng Wang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Using New York LaGuardia (LGA) as example, we analyze upgauging when  a proportion of RJ fleet is replaced by larger aircraft. This affects airport capacity in terms of terminal airspace, runway, taxiway system, and gate capacity. We show that moderate upgauging does not lead to increased delays. At the same time, while aircraft such as B757 and larger carry more passengers, they affect airport capacity and their use needs to be balanced.</br>
