<br>Title: Online Point of Distribution Location in Disaster Relief</br><br>Author: Ashlea Bennett Milburn, Assistant Professor, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, ashlea@uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chase Rainwater</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Information regarding affected populations, roads, buildings, and bridges becomes known on a rolling basis in the hours following a disaster.  We develop online models that use real-time information regarding demand and infrastructure status to specify shelter locations and supply distribution points as a specific damage scenario is realized.  Approximate solution approaches are employed to obtain good plans quickly. Computation results are presented for a New Madrid earthquake scenario.</br>
