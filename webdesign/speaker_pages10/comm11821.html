<br>Title: Numerical Methods for Solving 2-Stage Stochastic Network Protection Probs. w/Equilibrium Constraints</br><br>Author: Yueyue Fan, Assistant Professor, University of California, Department of CEE, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, yyfan@ucdavis.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Changzheng Liu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research focuses on pre-disaster transportation network protection under uncertain disaster scenarios.  We assume that the central planner decides which protection strategies to choose, while the network users choose their own best-perceived routes. This problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model with equilibrium constraints. The applicability of progressive hedging-based solution algorithm will be discussed.</br>
