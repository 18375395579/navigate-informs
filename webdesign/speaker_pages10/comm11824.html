<br>Title: A Linear MIP Formulation of the Berth Allocation Problem Reflecting Service Priority Arrangements</br><br>Author: Maria Boile, Associate Professor and Director of Research and Education, CAIT/MIEMP, Rutgers University, 100 Brett Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, boile@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sotiris Theofanis, Michail Golias</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The discrete and dynamic BAP is formulated as a linear MIP problem with the objective to simultaneously minimize the cost from ships?late departures and maximize the benefits from ships?early departures and timely departures, as these are specified in contractual agreements. A proof that the proposed formulation is the general case of previous BAP formulations presented in the literature is provided along with a numerical comparison.</br>
