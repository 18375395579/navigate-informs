<br>Title: Determining Optimal Maintenance Strategies for Mixed Public-private Transportation Networks</br><br>Author: Avinash Unnikrishnan, Graduate Research Assistant, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Sta. C1761, ECJ Hall 6.2, Austin, TX, 78731, United States of America, avinash@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ivan Damnjanovic, Varunraj Valsaraj, S. Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research focuses on the problem of scheduling maintenance in mixed public-private transportation networks.  The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and trends in social welfare and toll road revenue are studied.  The research approach utilizes Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) to obtain Pareto optimality.</br>
