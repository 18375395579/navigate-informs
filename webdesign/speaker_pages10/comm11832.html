<br>Title: Integrated Sourcing and Delivery Planning for Bulk Materials</br><br>Author: Xiajun Amy Pan, PhD student, University of Texas at Austin, IROM Department, 1 University Station B6500, Austin, TX, 78712-0212, United States of America, Xiajun.Pan@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anant Balakrishnan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Given the full-load material requirements for a set of geographically-dispersed customers and available sources of supply, we address the problem of selecting suppliers for each customer, sequencing material pickup and delivery operations to meet customer demand on time at minimum procurement, transportation, and delivery cost.  We formulate the problem as an integer-programming model, develop model enhancements, and provide computational results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</br>
