<br>Title: Manpower Reduction Heuristic for Automotive Assembly Planning</br><br>Author: Kacie Theisen, Ford Research & Advanced Engineering, 2101 Village Rd, Room 3011, RIC Building, MD 2122, Dearborn, MI, 48124, ktheise1@ford.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erica Klampfl, Oleg Gusikhin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a heuristic to minimize manpower on a mixed-model assembly line by reassigning work within a neighborhood of the current assignment. This heuristic is based on current operation assignments and does not require explicit representation of precedence constraints. We present an example where good starting manpower assignments are provided.</br>
