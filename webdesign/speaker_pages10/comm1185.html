<br>Title: A Behavioral User Equilibrium Principle for Traffic Assignment: Theory and Model</br><br>Author: Lei Zhang, Assistant Professor, Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, Oregon State University, 220 Owen Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331, United States, lei.zhang@oregonstate.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Wardrop’s user equilibrium principle assumes perfect spatial knowledge and utility maximization behavior.  In reality, users?route choice decisions are achieved through adaptive route search processes and involve spatial leaning. We address the important behavioral question of how individuals actually search for routes and achieve Behavioral User Equilibrium (BUE).</br>
