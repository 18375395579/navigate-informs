<br>Title: Weather-based Rerouting and Slot-exchange Mechanisms Within an Airspace Planning Model</br><br>Author: Michael McCrea, Assistant Professor, United States Military Academy, 155E Gardiner Loop, West Point, NY, 10996, United States of America, michael.mccrea@usma.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hanif Sherali</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop and evaluate two significant modeling concepts within the context of an Airspace Planning and Collaborative Decision-Making Model and, thereby, enhance its functionality in support of strategic and tactical level flight assessments.  The first is a severe weather-modeling paradigm used to provide rerouting strategies and expected delay information.  The second is a slot-exchange modeling concept that involves airline trading offers for arrival slots at an airport affected by a GDP.</br>
