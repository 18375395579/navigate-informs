<br>Title: An Optimization Model for Location of Public Charging Stations for Plug-in Electric Vehicles</br><br>Author: Yongxi Huang, Clemson University, 314 Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, yxhuang@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shengyin Li</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We formulated a multi-path station location model as a flow-based set covering location model to optimize a deployment of PEV public charging stations on a transportation network. The model was implemented in two numerical experiments. The results indicate that the charging deployment largely relies on vehicle range, available routing information, and drivers?acceptance of being deviated from pre-planned routes.</br>
