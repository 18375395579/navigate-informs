<br>Title: Extensible Simulation Framework for Railyard Operations</br><br>Author: David Ciemnoczolowski, Union Pacific Railroad, DDCIEMNO@UP.COM</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Simulation provides an excellent framework for analyzing impacts  of operational rules, yard design, and service design.  Unfortunately,  railyard operations do not readily fit into the classic server/queue  network typically assumed in discrete-event simulation.  In this talk, we will outline an extensible simulation approach using plug-in modules to evaluate different control policies.</br>
