<br>Title: Does EU ETS Instigate AirCargo Network Reconfiguration? A Model-based Analysis</br><br>Author: Ulrich Derigs, Department of Information Systems and Operations Research (WINFORS), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany, derigs@informatik.uni-koeln.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stefan Illing</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: From 2012 on aviation is included in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and operators have to hold one allowance per tonne of CO2 emitted on every flight departing from and/or arriving at an airport within the EU.  Now two questions are of interest:  Is it profitable for airlines to reconfigure their routes to reduce EU-related emissions and costs, and, will the schema be successful in the sense that emissions are reduced significantly. Here the potential for and the consequences of reconfiguration are different for the passenger and cargo business, respectively.  In this paper we present a model-based simulation of network (re-)configuration/optimization at cargo airlines under different EU ETS scenarios and we discuss the results with respect to the two issues raised above.</br>
