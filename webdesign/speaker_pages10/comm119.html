<br>Title: The Stochastic Post-Disaster Debris Clearance Problem</br><br>Author: Melih Celik, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr. NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, melihcelik@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Ergun, Pinar Keskinocak</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Post-disaster debris clearance aims to connect demand and supply for disaster relief by clearing debris-blocked roads. In this study, we define the Stochastic Debris Clearance Problem (SDCP), where the debris amounts are partially known due to lack of data or information infrastructure. We propose a POMDP model and various heuristic approaches for SDCP. We also test the performance of these approaches and compare them to current practice using random instances and a potential disaster scenario.</br>
