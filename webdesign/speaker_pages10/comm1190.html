<br>Title: Constrained Center Problem with Unreliable Facilities</br><br>Author: Mozart Menezes, Assistant Professor, Department of Operations Management & Information Technology, HEC School of Management, Paris, 1 Rue de la Liberation, Jouy-en-Josas, 78351, France, Menezes@hec.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman, Dmitry Krass</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper is an extension of the p-Center problem on a network. A facility may be unavailable, causing customers to seek service from operating facilities. Thus, customers may have to travel to a facility that is not the closest one. Every customer requires that a facility will be available with some positive probability. A heuristic approach is developed to ensure coverage feasibility while minimizing the expected maximum distance traveled in order to obtain service.</br>
