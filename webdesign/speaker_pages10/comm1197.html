<br>Title: Airline Voting Mechanisms for Parameter Selection for Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) Initiatives</br><br>Author: Vikrant Vaze, Member Research Staff, Philips Research North America, 345 Scarborough Road, Briarcliff Manor, NY, 10510, United States of America, vikrant.vaze@philips.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Barnhart</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Parameter selection for ATM initiatives is performed by the regulators while taking airline preferences into account. We design a voting scheme which can replace current ad-hoc methods. Strategic behavior is modeled using an integer programming formulation which explicitly accounts for tie-breaking rules. We solve for a Nash equilibrium using best response heuristics. We evaluate equilibrium properties including existence, uniqueness, convergence, system optimality and pareto optimality.</br>
