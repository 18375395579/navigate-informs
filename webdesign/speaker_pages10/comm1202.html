<br>Title: Accounting for Flexibility in Transportation Network Design Under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Gopal Patil, PhD Candidate, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 4002 JEC, Department of Civil Engineering, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, patilg@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a multiperiod flexible network design problem (F-NDP) accounting for demand uncertainty. Here the planner gets the flexibility of increasing/reducing the investment on any link at later stages based on the available recourse. We introduce the concept of transportation network flexibility and present two MPEC formulations for F-NDP. The implications of the model and results on test network are discussed.</br>
