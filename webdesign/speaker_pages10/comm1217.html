<br>Title: The Chance-constrained Stochastic P-hub Center Problem</br><br>Author: Thaddeus Sim, Assistant Professor, Le Moyne College, 1419 Salt Springs Road, Syracuse, NY, 13214, United States of America, simtk@lemoyne.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Barrett Thomas, Timothy Lowe</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Small package delivery companies offer services where packages are guaranteed to be delivered within a given time-frame. With variability in travel time, the configuration on the hub-and-spoke delivery network is vital in ensuring a high probability of meeting the service-level guarantee. We present the stochastic p-hub center problem with chance constraints, which we use to model the service-level guarantees. We discuss results and propose a heuristic for solving the problem.</br>
