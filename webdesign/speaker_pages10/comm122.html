<br>Title: Online Routing of Electric Vehicles in a Network with Battery Swapping</br><br>Author: Jonathan Adler, Arizona State University, 699 S Mill Ave, Tempe, AZ, 85281, United States of America, jonadler@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pitu Mirchandani</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Electric vehicles with swappable batteries are increasing in popularity, however their future success relies on the availability of charged batteries at located stations. In this talk we present a mathematical model minimizing the average distance traveled by electric vehicles in a network with limited swapping stations. The routes chosen for the vehicles are dependent on the current inventory status of the stations taking into account unknown future arrivals.</br>
