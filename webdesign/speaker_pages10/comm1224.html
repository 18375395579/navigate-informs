<br>Title: Multi-sensor Data Fusion for Missile Defense</br><br>Author: Dimitri Papageorgiou, Systems Engineer, Raytheon, 235 Presidential Way, Woburn, MA, 01801, United States of America, Dimitri_J_Papageorgiou@raytheon.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The primary goal of multi-sensor data fusion in missile defense is to leverage the information collected by a suite of sensors to create a more complete integrated picture of objects of interest. When heterogeneous sensors with varying resolution observe different features for different subsets of the truth, this task becomes all the more challenging. We present fusion techniques to handle these issues and the consequences they have on algorithms required to solve these fusion problems.</br>
