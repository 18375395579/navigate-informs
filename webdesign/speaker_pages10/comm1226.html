<br>Title: Optimization of a Distribution Center Yard: Trailer Flows and Layout</br><br>Author: Suzanne Marcotte, Professor, ESG-UQAM and CIRRELT, Dept Management & Technology, P.O. Box 8888, Downtown Station, Montreal, QC, H3C3P8, Canada, marcotte.suzanne@uqam.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Teodor Crainic, Maxime Durand</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Distribution centers are important facilities in a distribution network. As opposed to many researches that focuses on optimizing the flows of goods inside a DC, our research focuses on the flows of the trailers that are handled in the DC yard. In our research, we first show how we have adapted Holodesign, an optimization tool to design robust facility layouts, to design the layout of the DC yard. We then show analytical results under various layout types using a Monte Carlo simulation.</br>
