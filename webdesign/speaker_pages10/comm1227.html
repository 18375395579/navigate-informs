<br>Title: Estimating Congestion Impacts on Rail Lines via Statistical Methods</br><br>Author: Michael Gorman, Associate Professor, University of Dayton, School of Business, Dayton, OH, United States, Michael.Gorman@notes.udayton.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: As railroads become more and more congested with increasing traffic base, it becomes paramount to estimate the congestion impact of new traffic.  Well-tested, specialized simulation software is often used for such predictions. However, simulations have some drawbacks and are time consuming to run.  We test the viability of statistical methods as a low cost alternative for prediction the impact of additional trains on train running times.  Empirical results are presented.</br>
