<br>Title: Delay Trend Assessment for Future NAS Using  Weather-Impacted Traffic Index</br><br>Author: Alexander Klein, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, United States, aklein1@gmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Weather-Impacted Traffic Index (WITI) is a useful metric for quantifying inclement weather impact on NAS operations, with Delay as the measure of NAS response. We use WITI for assessing delay trends for future-NAS projections in 2010 and 2015, compared to base year, 2004. Three different traffic samples, each representing a busy weekday in the respective year, are used. We apply an entire convective season’s weather to the base day, with day-of-the-week traffic demand fluctuations.</br>
