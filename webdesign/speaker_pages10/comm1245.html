<br>Title: Network Flow Based Stochastic Programming Formulations for Capacity Planning at Airport Terminals</br><br>Author: Senay Solak, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, ssolak@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John-Paul Clarke, Ellis Johnson</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop functions to approximate maximum delays in passageways and processing stations at airport terminals during peak demand periods, and use these delay functions to propose stochastic programming formulations based on a network representation of the whole airport terminal. Solutions of the proposed models provide optimal capacity requirements for each area in an airport terminal during the initial building phase, as well as the optimal expansion policy under stochastic future demand.</br>
