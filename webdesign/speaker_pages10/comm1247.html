<br>Title: Traffic Assignment with Paired Alternative Segments</br><br>Author: David Boyce, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Northwestern University, 2149 Grey Avenue, Evanston, IL, 60201, d-boyce@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hillel Bar-Gera</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Preliminary computational results for large-scale networks are presented for a new traffic assignment algorithm that maintains consistency among paired alternative route segments across all OD pairs.  Consistency means route flow proportions on alternative subroutes are equal across OD pairs, which is a behavioral interpretation of the entropy maximizing route flows.</br>
