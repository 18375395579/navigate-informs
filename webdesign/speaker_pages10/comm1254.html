<br>Title: Crossdocking Network Design with Load Balancing and Operational Considerations</br><br>Author: Nayoung Cho, Ph.D Candidate, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States, chon@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leyla Ozsen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study a crossdocking network design problem for a two-stage and single product supply chain. Our objective is to determine the optimal location of crossdocking centers and the optimal retailer-crossdocking assignments that minimize the sum of the fixed location, the transportation, the ordering, and the pipeline inventory costs across whole supply chain given the service rate of each facility and the lead time restrictions. We propose a solution methodology based on Lagrangian Relaxation.</br>
