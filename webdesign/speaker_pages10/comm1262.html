<br>Title: Reliable Infrastructure Location Design under Interdependent Disruptions Caused by Supporting System Failures</br><br>Author: Xiaopeng Li, Mississippi State University, PO Box 9546, 235L Walker Hall, 501 Hardy Road, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, United States of America, xli@cee.msstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yanfeng Ouyang, Fan Peng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper addresses facility location design under interdependent facility disruption risks due to shared usage of supporting stations that themselves are fallible. We consolidate the problem of minimizing the total expected system cost with regard to location selections under an exponential number of disruption scenarios into a compact polynomial-size integer programming model. This model can be efficiently solved by proposed customized algorithms.</br>
