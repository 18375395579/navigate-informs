<br>Title: Solving a Large Scale Integrated Airline Planning Problem</br><br>Author: Okan Orsan Ozener, Ozyegin University, Cekmekoy, Istanbul, Turkey, orsan.ozener@ozyegin.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Melda Ormeci, Gunes Erdogan, Mohamed Haouari</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Airline planning problems are considered to be very challenging problems and typically are solved sequentially. In the literature attempts have been made to integrate different stages of these planning problems. We address the integrated fleet assignment and crew pairing problem based on representative data of a European Airline. This problem has its specific properties (e.g. fixed crew salaries, single base, properties of flight schedule).  We develop heuristic based novel solution methods.</br>
