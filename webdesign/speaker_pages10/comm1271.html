<br>Title: Discovering Daily Driving Patterns During Disaster Recovery using Mobile Sensors</br><br>Author: Jeff Ban, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th St, JEC 4034, CEE, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, banx@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yingyan Lou, Cara Wang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Although evacuation and emergency management immediately after disasters have been extensively studied (e.g., the field of humanitarian logistics), relatively little attention has been put on what usually happened during disaster recovery. This is however vital to understand the factors that facilitate or hinder the extended recovery process after major disasters. Mobile sensors provide novel opportunities to reveal the behaviors (expected to be dynamic and varying over time) of both individual travelers and the traffic system during such processes, for which data collection has been a long standing challenging issue. We present our recent work and some preliminary results of using mobile sensors to track the daily (driving) patterns of individuals who impacted by major disasters. The results clearly show the close correlation between daily travel patterns and recovery activities of the individuals (e.g., to rebuilding the old house that was destroyed by the disaster).</br>
