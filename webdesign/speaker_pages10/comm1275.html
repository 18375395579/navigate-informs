<br>Title: An Exact Method for the Orienteering Problem with Time Windows</br><br>Author: Andrés L. Medaglia, Associate Professor, Universidad de los Andes, Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, COPA, Bogota, Colombia, amedagli@uniandes.edu.co</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leonardo Lozano, Daniel Duque</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW) is the problem of finding a tour that maximizes the profit available at the nodes in a time-constrained network. The OPTW has multiple applications in transportation, telecommunications, and scheduling. We extended an exact method for the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints  (ESPPRC) to incorporate problem specific knowledge. We tested our method on instances derived from  the well-known dataset by Solomon.</br>
