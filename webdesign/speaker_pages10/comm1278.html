<br>Title: Revenue Management in Indian Railways</br><br>Author: Goutam Dutta, Professor, IIM Ahmedabad, Wing - 3, IIM Campus, Vastrapur, Ahmedabad, Gu, 380015, India, goutam@iimahd.ernet.in</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We attempt the revenue management on one of the trains of Indian Railways, by formulating it as a multi-period, network linear programming problem with the flow balance, capacity, demand and routing constraints. We also discuss the issues of generating booking profile and forecasting demand. The model is expected to be tested with the real data of South Eastern Railway, India.</br>
