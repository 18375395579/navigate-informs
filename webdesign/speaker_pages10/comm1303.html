<br>Title: Policy-based Routing in a Stochastic Networks with Incident Risks</br><br>Author: Yupo Chan, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, 2801 South University, Little Rock, AR, United States of America, yxchan@ualr.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Adeyemi Fowe</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a routing algorithm that takes adaptive routing decision at each node en-route. It considers stochasticity, incident delay, and travel-time forecasting in a non-FIFO network. The routing decision is based on two criteria: the optimal next-hop node, and the optimal wait-time. Under these circumstances, a traveler can violate the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) property, by arriving earlier than another who started before s/he did.</br>
