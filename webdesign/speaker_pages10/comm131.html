<br>Title: Impact of Aircraft Arrival Processes on Airport Capacity and Delay</br><br>Author: Abdullah Karaman, Assistant Professor, University of Turkish Aeronautical Association, Turkkusu Campus, Etimesgut, Ankara, 06790, Turkey, abdullahkaraman@yahoo.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Modeling arrival traffic at an airport is a challenging task. Arrivals as wheels of the aircraft touching the landing field do not conform to randomness. This is because air traffic controllers start positioning the aircrafts in order so that the separation minima are satisfied. In this study, we investigate the impact of arrival processes on airport capacity and delay. We determined the cost of incorrectly specifying a distribution via simulation studies under both heavy and light traffic.</br>
