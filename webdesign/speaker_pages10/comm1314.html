<br>Title: An Algorithm for Shortest Path Projections for the Additive Model in DEA</br><br>Author: Warren Sutton, Doctoral Student, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, wsutton@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Seiford</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The DEA Additive Model has an objective that maximizes the sum of the slacks and naturally finds a path to the frontier for inefficient DMUs that is not the shortest possible path. This study presents an algorithm for determining the shortest path projections for inefficient units in the Additive model.</br>
