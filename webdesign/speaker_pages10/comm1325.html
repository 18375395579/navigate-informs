<br>Title: Economies of Scale in Hub Location Problems</br><br>Author: James Campbell, University of Missouri - St Louis, College of Business Administration, St Louis, MO, 63121, United States of America, campbell@umsl.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Basic hub location formulations use a simple model for transportation cost with a flow-independent discounted cost rate on inter-hub links to model economies of scale from flow consolidation. However, in optimal solutions inter-hub flows are often exceeded by flows on some spokes; yet the smaller inter-hub flows receive the cost discount. This paper examines optimal passenger and freight flows to document this behavior and suggests improvements in modeling economies of scale for hub location.</br>
