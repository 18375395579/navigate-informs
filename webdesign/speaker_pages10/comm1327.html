<br>Title: Optimizing Positions of Port Defense Radar Picket Ships- A Defender-attacker Model</br><br>Author: Gerald Brown, Distinguished Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Research Department, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, GBrown@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Carlyle, Kevin Wood, Jeff Kline, Abdul Ghaffar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The US Coast Guard is purchasing hundreds of small patrol boats for port defense, including protecting US Navy ships making port calls worldwide.  We show how to cooperatively position a set of such patrol pickets to minimize the probability a set of speedboat attackers will avoid detection by maneuvering to evade us, given they can observe our picket positions and know our radar capablities.  We show several port examples and the surprising insights offered.</br>
