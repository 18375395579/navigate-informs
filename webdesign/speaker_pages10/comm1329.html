<br>Title: Optimizing Ridesharing Services for Airport Access</br><br>Author: Lei Feng, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn L. Martin Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, lfeng@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elise Miller-Hooks, Paul Schonfeld, Matthew Mohebbi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The vehicle routing and scheduling problem faced by the Supreme Airport Shuttle, Inc. that provides ridesharing services to customers to and from the airport is explored. Mathematical models and solution algorithms are developed for three operational policies. Computational experiments based on real-world data are designed to evaluate proposed solution algorithms and assess various performance measures for different operational policies.</br>
