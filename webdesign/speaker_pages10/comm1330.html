<br>Title: Distributed Optimization of Markov Reward Processes</br><br>Author: Enrique Campos-Nañez, Assistant Professor, The George Washington University, 1776 G Street NW, Suite 161, Washington, DC, 20052, United States, ecamposn@gwu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a gradient-based policy search technique that exploits the fact that in many applications the state space and control actions are naturally distributed. We introduce a technique in which  a set of distributed agents compute an estimate of the partial derivative of a system-wide objective with respect to the parameters under their control. We illustrate the algorithms with an application to energy-efficient coverage in energy harvesting sensors networks, e.g. heliomotes.</br>
