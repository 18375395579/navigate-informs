<br>Title: Solving Facility Location-allocation Problems That Account for Scale-dependent Logistics Costs</br><br>Author: Michael Bucci, Doctoral Candidate, North Carolina State University, CB # 7906, Daniels Hall, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States, mbucci@nc.rr.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Don Warsing, Michael Kay</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a formulation of the facility location-allocation problem that accounts for nonlinear, scale-dependent marginal costs of operating facilities, holding inventory, and transporting goods. We compare several meta-heuristic solution approaches that account for these cost complexities, and compare them to best-available bounds or optimal solutions. We use our results to identify key principles regarding scale effects on network design and to motivate further extensions of the formulation.</br>
