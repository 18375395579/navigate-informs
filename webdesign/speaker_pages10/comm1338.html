<br>Title: Network Design Problem with Relay Stations Considering Survivability</br><br>Author: Sadan Kulturel-Konak, Associate Professor, Penn State Berks, Tulpehocken Rd., PO Box 7009, Reading, PA, 19610, United States of America, sadan@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abdullah Konak</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this research, the design problem copes with selecting network links and determining the relay stations?locations to minimize the design cost.  In addition to the distance constraint on the path that a signal can travel without visiting a relay station, the survivability of the paths is also considered.   A metaheuristics approach is designed to solve the problem, and its efficiency is shown on different problems.</br>
