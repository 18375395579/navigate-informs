<br>Title: Virtual Spares</br><br>Author: John-Paul Clarke, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 270 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0150, United States of America, johnpaul@gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that more robust schedules can be developed by correlating the ground-times of aircraft with the expected delay upstream of connections. However, the resulting schedules are not necessarily amenable to the swapping of aircraft, a commonly used strategy for dealing with the realized (as opposed to expected) disruptions. I present a novel aircraft-scheduling concept that leverages the beneficial features of both approaches to mitigating the effects of disruptions.</br>
