<br>Title: Maximizing Trading Area of a New Facility: The Planar Case</br><br>Author: Dmitry Krass, Professor, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S3e6, Canada, Krass@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Atsuo Suzuki</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider adding a new facility to a region containing competitive facilities. The demand is assumed to be uniformly distributed. The objective is to find the location for a new facility that maximizes its trading area, which is equivalent to maximizing the area  of the Voronoi cell for the new facility. We develop an exact solution method based on the Big Triangle - Small Triangle algorithm. Novel approach is used to develop upper bounds.</br>
