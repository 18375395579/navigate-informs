<br>Title: Inventory-Location Problems in the Presence of Time-Sensitive Consumer Demand</br><br>Author: Mozart Menezes, Assistant Professor, Department of Operations Management & Information Technology, HEC School of Management, Paris, 1 Rue de la Liberation, Jouy-en-Josas, 78351, France, Menezes@hec.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dmitry Krass, Oded Berman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a problem of serving customer demand from a set of facilities where demand may be lost if the delivery cannot be made in time. Thus, both inventory and location decisions must be made simultaneously, taking into account fixed location costs, inventory-related costs and opportunity costs for lost demand. Such problems are often faced by internet-based retailers, such as Amazon.com. Both theoretical and computational results will be presented.</br>
