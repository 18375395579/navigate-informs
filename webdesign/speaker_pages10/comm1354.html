<br>Title: Robust Coverage Location Problems under Travel Time Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Iman Hajizadeh, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, iman@rotman.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman, Dmitry Krass</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the maximum covering problem on a network with travel time uncertainty. In addition to the standard stochastic and robust formulations, we optimize the average coverage subject to a bound on the worst case coverage. We present greedy and Lagrangian relaxation heuristics and compare their performances with MIP formulation.</br>
