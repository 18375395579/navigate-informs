<br>Title: Predicting Damage for Major Storms: A Data Driven Approach</br><br>Author: Georgia Perakis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 100 Main Street, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, georgiap@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mallik Angalakudati, Jorge Calzada, Vivek Farias, Matthieu Monsch, Anna Papush, Sean Whipple, Cheri Warren, John Williams, Jeremy Schein, Jonathan Gonynor</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In the past few years the New England area has experienced severe weather storms that left thousands of homes without power for prolonged periods of time. Through collaboration with a major utility company, we present a model that forecasts damage caused by a storm. We build a data driven model that utilizes the interaction between properties of the electrical network and weather to predict damage. Its output feeds to an optimization model for contracting repair crews in advance of a storm.</br>
