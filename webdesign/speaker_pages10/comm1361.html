<br>Title: Concrete Pavement Condition Monitoring using Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors</br><br>Author: Ying Huang, North Dakota State University, Dept. of Civil Engineering, Fargo, ND, 58108, United States of America, ying.huang@ndsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leonard Palek, Ben Worel, Maureen Jensen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: For evaluation of the performance of concrete pavements, reliable infrastructure sensors are demanded. Traditional electrical sensors such as strain gauges and vibration wires, showed high electromagnetic interference (EMI), high dependence on environmental conditions such as moisture, and relatively short life cycle, which are unreliable for long-term pavement performance monitoring. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, with unique advantages of compactness, immune to EMI and moisture, capability of quasi-distributed sensing, and long life cycle, will be a perfect candidate for long-term concrete pavement performance evaluation and condition monitoring. However, the FBG sensors also surfer from their frangible nature of glass materials for a good survive rate during concrete pavement construction. In this study, Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) materials have been used to package the FBG sensors and further applied to evaluate the performance of concrete pavements, at MnROAD facility, Minnesota DOT (MnDOT). The design and layout of the FRP-FBG sensors, their field test setup, data acquisition, and data analysis for pavement condition evaluation will be presented. Upon validation, the FRP-FBG sensors can be applied for condition monitoring of concrete pavements to assistant pavement maintenance.</br>
