<br>Title: Anticipatory Algorithms for Online Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization</br><br>Author: Pascal Van Hentenryck, Professor of Computer Science, Brown University, Box 1910, 115 Waterman Street, 4th Floor, Providence, RI, 02912, United States, pvh@cs.brown.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This talk considers online stochastic combinatorial optimization (OSCO) problems where online decisions must select which requests to serve and how. These problems arise in many practical applications in networking, reservation systems, and vehicle routing and dispatching. This talk presents a class of anticipatory algorithms for OSCO applications, studies its theoretical properties, and demonstrates their applicability on a variety of complex problems.</br>
