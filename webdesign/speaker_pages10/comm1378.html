<br>Title: Acquisition Viability When Combining Supply Chain Networks</br><br>Author: Mariah Magagnotti, Clemson University, 717 Alpine Drive, Seneca, SC, 29672, United States of America, mariahm@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Scott Mason</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: During any corporate merger or acquisition, the need to combine each party’s supply chain networks can be a complicated task.  We present a multi-commodity, mixed-integer model that balances the costs of both network design and network flow decisions against the benefits of increased network connectivity to aid in decision making.  Early results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed solution approach.</br>
