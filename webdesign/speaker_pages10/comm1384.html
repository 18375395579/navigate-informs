<br>Title: Mathematical Model for Airline Flight Re-scheduling Problem under Disruptions</br><br>Author: Mohamed Kharbeche, Postdoctoral Associate, Qatar University, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Doha, 2713, Qatar, mkharbec@qu.edu.qa</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ameer Al-Salem, Abdel Magid Hamouda, Fajr Ali Akbar Ansari, Sara Yousuf Al-Haidous, Nayla Ahmed Al-Thani</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose airline re-scheduling model that simultaneously develop recovery plans by determining alternate flight schedules with a minimal change from original schedules. This model produces the optimal track, level and departure time for each flight of a schedule after a disruption. Computational results  are investigated for this exact method.</br>
