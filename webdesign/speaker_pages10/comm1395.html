<br>Title: Robust Storage Assignment in Unit-Load Warehouses</br><br>Author: Yun Fong Lim, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 50 Stamford Road, #04-01, Singapore, SG, Singapore, yflim@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Melvyn Sim, Marcus Ang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Assigning products to and retrieving them from proper storage locations are crucial in minimizing the operating cost of a unit-load warehouse. We develop a robust optimization model to solve the problem with variable supply and uncertain demand in a multi-period setting. Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in the literature.</br>
