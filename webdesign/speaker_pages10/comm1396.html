<br>Title: The Aisle Design Problem for Unit-Load Warehouses</br><br>Author: Kevin Gue, Associate Professor, Auburn University, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Auburn, AL, 36849, United States, kevin.gue@auburn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Russell Meller</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We introduce and build models for the aisle design problem for unit-load warehouses, where the challenge is to construct picking and cross aisles in a way that minimizes expected retrieval time. Our results include a simple warehouse design that promises a 20 percent reduction in expected labor cost for warehouses of reasonable size.</br>
