<br>Title: Optimal Staging Area Locations and Material Recycling Strategies for Sustainable Highway Reconstruction</br><br>Author: Ryan Smith, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, United States of America, smith103@illinois.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Sustainable highway reconstruction requires strategies that optimally procure material from supply locations, select locations to process material, and ship material to their demand locations to reduce the consumption of energy and material resources. Our model determines (i) optimal locations for fixed and mobile staging areas, and (ii) material recycling and shipment strategies.</br>
