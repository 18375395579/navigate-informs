<br>Title: New Developments in the Computerized Routing of Meter Readers Over Street Networks</br><br>Author: Bruce Golden, University of Maryland, R.H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, bgolden@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Wasil, Robert Shuttleworth</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Recent advances in utility meter reading technology necessitate similar advances in routing techniques.  For a given geographic region, the problem is to construct novel ways of building highly efficient, optimized routes.  We propose and implement an optimization-based approach that reduces the duration and cost of a set of routes.</br>
