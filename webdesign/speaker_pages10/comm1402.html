<br>Title: A Complex Network Analysis of Resiliency in Surface Transportation Networks</br><br>Author: Abigail Osei-Asamoah, PhD. Student, University of Connecticut, 261 Glenbrook Road, Unit 3037, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, abo09001@engr.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Lownes</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A complex network approach is used to analyze resiliency in surface transportation networks using examples of the CT US Highway and Interstate Network,Indiana Interurban RailRoad Network and the Swiss Rail Network. Critical thresholds for failure are established using  complex network metrics and can contribute to preparedness,response,and recovery in disasters and emergencies. The study compares resiliency in some of the transportation networks to that of a biologically generated network.</br>
