<br>Title: Modeling Truck Lane Restriction on Major Urban Freeways</br><br>Author: Renatus Mussa, P.E., Associate Professor & Director of Traffic Engineering Laboratory, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, FAMU-Florida State University College of Engineering, 2525 Pottsdamer Street, Room 129, Tallahassee, FL, 32310, United States, mussa@eng.fsu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: To improve safety and efficiency of traffic flow on urban freeways, some agencies have imposed restriction of trucks from certain lanes.  This research determines the safety and operational benefits of truck lane restrictions in peak and off-peak periods considering whether the freeway corridor has a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane.</br>
