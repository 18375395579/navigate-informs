<br>Title: Robust Design of Hub-and-Spoke Network with Congestions</br><br>Author: Yu An, University of South Florida, 4202 E Fowler Ave, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, yan2@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu Zhang, Bo Zeng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a hub-and-spoke system design scheme that simultaneously includes the practical factors of hub congestion and hub disruptions on the basis of the classical design model. Specifically, robust optimization technique is applied to handle the random hub failures. Demand loss factor will also be introduced to model the affected flows that can not be served in a failure scenario.</br>
