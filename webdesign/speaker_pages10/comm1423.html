<br>Title: Sheltering Network Design and Resource Management Responding to Natural Disasters</br><br>Author: Mingzhou Jin, Associate Professor, Mississippi State University, Department of Ind. and Sys. Eng., PO Box 9542, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, United States of America, MJin@ise.msstate.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Natural disasters usually have early warnings, which provide opportunities to deliver resources to shelters. We model the sheltering network design and resource management problem as a two-stage stochastic program. In the first stage the locations and capacity of permanent shelters are decided. In the second stage resources are shipped from distribution centers and other sources or from other shelters to the shelters in needs. The model also provides a plan to transport expected evacuees.</br>
