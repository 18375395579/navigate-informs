<br>Title: Integrated Scheduling Optimization of Loading and Unloading Trains at a Container Terminal</br><br>Author: Amir Hossein Gharehgozli, Rotterdam School of Management, Postbus 1738, Rotterdam, 3000DR, Netherlands, agharehgozli@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leo Kroon, Ren?de Koster</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of loading and unloading trains at a container terminal. Trains are served by a gantry crane which spreads over all of them on parallel tracks. Multiple straddle carriers move containers from the stacking area to a drop off lane parallel to the trains and vice versa. We focus on how to sequence the gantry crane, where to drop off containers, and finally how to sequence straddle carriers. The objective is to minimize the total earliness and tardiness of trains.</br>
