<br>Title: Congestion Pricing for Scheduled-based Transit Networks</br><br>Author: Siriphong Lawphongpanich, University of Florida, Industrial & Systems Engineering, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, lawphong@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Younes Hamdouch</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe techniques for adjusting or setting fares on transit networks to encourage passengers to choose travel strategies that lead to the least system delay.  Our techniques rely on scheduled-based transit assignment models that handle vehicle capacities explicitly and account for priorities in loading passengers.  Traditional tolling schemes such as marginal cost pricing are not applicable because delay in transit networks is due to factors different from those in traffic networks.</br>
