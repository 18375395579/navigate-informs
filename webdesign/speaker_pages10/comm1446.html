<br>Title: Traffic Control Agency Planning and Signal Optimization for Special Planned Events</br><br>Author: Qing He, IBM Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, qhe@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Arun Hampapur, Xuan Liu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Large scale special planned events, attracting both high volume of pedestrians and vehicles, result in significant nonrecurrent congestion as well as queue spillover. In this research, we proposed a mixed intersection control model utilizing both manual control from traffic control agency (TCA) and automatic signal control. Different with traffic signals, TCA can effectively balance queues and increase throughput, and prevent intersection capacity drop caused by large volume of pedestrians.</br>
