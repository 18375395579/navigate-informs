<br>Title: Designing Membership and Allocation Mechanisms for Air Cargo Alliances</br><br>Author: Lori Houghtalen, PhD Student, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, lhoughta@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Özlem Ergun, Joel Sokol</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We address causes of suboptimal behavior among carriers in air cargo alliances, and design mechanisms that may be used to promote compliance with the system optimal solution.  In particular, we develop algorithms for fair revenue allocation from among alliance members and investigate implications for member carriers operating different types of networks.</br>
