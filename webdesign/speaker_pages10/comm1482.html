<br>Title: The Role of Network Topology in the Resilience  of Transportation Systems</br><br>Author: Elise Miller-Hooks, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn Martin Hall, Dept. of Civil & Env. Eng., College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, elisemh@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Denny, Xiaodong Zhang, Shabtai Issac</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The role of a network’s topology in its resilience to disaster events caused by a host of possible hazard types is studied herein. Insights gleened from results of systematically designed numerical experiments employing a developed modeling framework and appropriate adaptations to consider a variety of resilience measures provide a basis for the characterization of highly resilient network topologies and identification of network attributes that might lead to poorly performing systems.</br>
