<br>Title: Optimal Signal Control for Corridor-Based Emergency Evacuation</br><br>Author: Ying Liu, Research Assistant, University of Maryland, Department of Civil Engineering, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, lyng@wam.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaorong Lai, Gang-Len Chang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This study presents two mixed-integer models for design of signal control strategies for corridor-based evacuation. The models take into account various operational complexities, such as selection of critical intersections for control of turning movements, design of signal settings, and rerouting of traffic from origins to critical intersections or between corridors. The numerical results for two networks in Washington D.C. have revealed the models' potential for use in real-world applications.</br>
