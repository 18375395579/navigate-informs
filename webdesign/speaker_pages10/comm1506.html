<br>Title: Integrated Optimization of Lane Markings and Timings for Signalized Roundabouts</br><br>Author: Yue Liu, Department of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, United States of America, liu28@uwm.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper contributes to developing an integrated optimization model that is able to simultaneously determine lane markings and timings for a signalized roundabout. A precedence graph is uniquely designed to formulate a unified phase structure at both approaches and circulatory lanes. Capacity maximization, cycle length minimization, and delay minimization problems are formulated to optimize the operation of a roundabout.</br>
