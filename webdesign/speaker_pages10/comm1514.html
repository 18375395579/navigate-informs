<br>Title: Travel-Time Minimization in Transportation Networks by Near-Optimal Tollbooth Placement</br><br>Author: Mauricio Resende, AT&T Labs Research, 180 Park Avenue, Room C241, Florham Park, NJ, 07932, United States, mgcr@research.att.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Luciana Buriol, Michael Hirsch, Tania Querido, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a memetic algorithm to place K tollbooths and set corresponding tolls on a capacitated transportation network such that when travelers take a least-cost route, their expected travel time is minimized. We illustrate the algorithm on five real networks: Sioux Falls, Anaheim, Stockholm, Barcelona, and Winnipeg.</br>
