<br>Title: Dynamic Headway in Positive Train Control</br><br>Author: Lunce Fu, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, luncefu@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maged Dessouky</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider dynamic headway control problem under no-deadlock and no-collision constraints. Different speed limits are applied to different railway segments and junctions according to local locations. Moreover, trains?dynamics is taken into consideration. A train movement rule is proposed to reduce delays and guarantee security.  And we evaluate how dynamic headway will influence the efficiency of the system through simulation of passenger and freight trains in Los Angeles County.</br>
