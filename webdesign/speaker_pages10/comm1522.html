<br>Title: Information Dissemination Delay in a Connected Vehicle Network Running on a Single Two-way Road</br><br>Author: Lili Du, Assistant Professor, Illinois Institute of Technology, 3201 S. Dearborn St., Chicago, IL, 60616, United States of America, ldu3@iit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hoang Dao</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research proposes mathematical description models to capture information propagation delay in a connected vehicle network running on a two-way road.  Intermittent wireless communication under dynamic traffic flow condition, and wireless communication interference among vehicles are integrated into the model development. The proposed models are validated are simulation experiments</br>
