Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Calibration of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) to match the observed flows has been one of the key challenges in the deployment of DTA on real world networks. The input parameters can be calibrated within bounds to match the flows. We investigate the linear programming techniques to determine the optimal combination of input parameters that minimizes the error between DTA and observed flows. Numerical experiments are presented and discussed.</br>
