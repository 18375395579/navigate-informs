<br>Title: The Wisdom of Voters: Evaluating the Weber Objective at the Condorcet Solution</br><br>Author: Mozart Menezes, Associate Professor of Operations Management, University of Calgary, Haskayne School of Business, Calgary, Canada, mozart.menezes@utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zvi Drezner</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the quality of Condorcet solutions comparing it to that of a central decision maker in the context of a locational problem, concluding, through exhaustive experiments, that if each population member votes according to his/her own self-interest, then the Weber objective at the Condorcet point is very close to the optimal Weber value. Being short of, or reducing the set of, candidate solutions has little impact on the quality of the Condorcet solution.</br>
