<br>Title: A Network Flow Methodology to Estimate Empty Trips in Freight Transportation Models</br><br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Associate Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, G175F, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sukkusur@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rodrigo Mesa-Arango</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This research presents a novel methodology to estimate the number of empty trips useful for regional freight planning. This methodology is based on a time expanded network flow approach that captures behavioral and operational characteristics of the carriers. The model is formulated as a linear optimization problem that minimizes the system costs associated to truck trips. The model is validated with a commercial vehicle survey from Colombia.</br>
