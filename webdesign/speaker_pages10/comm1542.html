<br>Title: A Network Design Model for Hub Location Problems</br><br>Author: Armin Luer-Villagra, PhD candidate, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Department of Electrical Engineering, Av. Vicuña Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile, arminluer@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guillermo Latorre-Núñez, Vladimir Marianov</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a mixed-integer programming model for a hub location problem, formulated as a network design problem. The model determines the capacities required at both nodes (airports) and at arcs to carry the offered traffic. Instead of using an exogenous factor for economies of scale, the model applies discounts wherever the traffic is large enough. We solve the model using an exact method and a heuristic.</br>
