<br>Title: Urban Route Planning in the Management of Delivery Time Windows</br><br>Author: Jan Fabian Ehmke, University of Braunschweig, Mühlenpfordtstraße 23, Braunschweig, 38106, Germany, j-f.ehmke@tu-bs.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ann M. Campbell</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Our goal is to improve the efficiency and reliability of last mile deliveries in urban areas. We present a computational framework, which considers time-dependent travel times in route planning of urban delivery tours. In particular, we investigate to which extent the design and the selection of delivery time windows might benefit from additional traffic information being available from telematics-based data collection technology.</br>
