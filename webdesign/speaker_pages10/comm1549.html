<br>Title: Decomposition Methods for the Integrated Aircraft Routing and Crew Scheduling Problem</br><br>Author: Anne Mercier, CRT, Universit?de Montréal, C.P. 6128, Succursale Centre-ville, Montréal, Canada, anne.mercier@gerad.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this integrated problem, linking constraints impose minimum connection times for crews that depend on aircraft connections. We propose a model incorporating robustness to handle these constraints and compare two Benders decomposition solution methods. We also consider an additional level of integration by adding some flight scheduling decisions. To solve this extended problem, we propose a compact formulation and a dynamic constraint generation procedure. Computational experiments are presented and some theoretical results are given.</br>
