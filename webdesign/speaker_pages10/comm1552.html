<br>Title: High Occupancy/Toll Lane Pricing under Stochastic Demand</br><br>Author: Stephen Boyles, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, 301 E Dean Keeton St Stop C1761, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, sboyles@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lauren Gardner, Hillel Bar-Gera</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider and evaluate potential HOT lane pricing schemes, focusing on the issue of real-time pricing amidst uncertainty in demand  and driver value of time.  We conduct a set of experiments to demonstrate the impact that these stochastic factors have as their parameters vary.</br>
