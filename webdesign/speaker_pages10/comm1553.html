<br>Title: Passenger Coach Utilization on Indian Railway: Leveraging Standardized Train Composition & Scheduling</br><br>Author: G. Raghuram, Indian Railways Chair Professor, Public Systems Group, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, GJ, 380015, India, graghu@iimahd.ernet.in</br><br>Coauthor(s): Piyush Verma, Narayan Rangaraj</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Indian Railways run 8702 passenger services daily, amounting to 8.4 billion coach km for 2006-07. The utilization of coaches for these services varies from 250-1000 km per day, averaging 500 km. We present a systematic approach to improve utilization of coaches, using category wise standardization of trains and exploiting scheduling flexibility. We also explore the implications on service levels due to maintenance and late running, and costs due to coach requirements and lost revenues.</br>
