<br>Title: Decision Support for Assessing Vulnerability Among Interdependent Critical Infrastructure Systems</br><br>Author: Earl Rusty Lee, Assistant Professor, University of Delaware, Dept of Civil and Env Engr, 360G Dupont Hall, Newark, DE, 19716, United States, elee@udel.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Wallace, John E. Mitchell</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A “system of systems?model has been built which takes into account vulnerability due to interdependency. MUNICIPAL (the MUlti-Network Interdependent Critical Infrastructure Program for Analysis of Lifelines) consists of an interdependent layered network model, its supporting algorithms and the necessary linkages to databases and GIS displays. The system can be used to check the existing network for vulnerability due to interconnectedness and for the design of truly redundant, independent paths.</br>
