<br>Title: Spreadsheet Based Optimization for Cell Formation Problem</br><br>Author: Gurkan Ozturk, Assistant Professor, Anadolu University, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Industrial Eng., Eskisehir, 26555, Turkey, gurkan.o@anadolu.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mumin Sonmez</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this study, a new hybrid algorithm based on competitive neural network and particle swarm optimization approaches is proposed to solve cell formation problem with alternative part routings. This algorithm is implemented in two spreadsheet platform: MS Excel and Google Spreadsheet. Although MS Excel faster than the Google Spreadsheet, the property of internet access of google spreadsheet presents different advantages.</br>
