<br>Title: Comparing Organic vs. Handoff UAV Support to the Maneuver Company</br><br>Author: Roger Chapman Burk, Associate Professor, US Military Academy, Department of Systems Engineering, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, roger.burk@usma.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robin Burk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider two alternatives:  (1) the “Organic?system, which consists of two VTOL vehicles of ~50 kg each assigned to each company and flying missions when needed; and (2) the “Handoff?system, a 100-200 kg air vehicle in the air constantly, operated at the battalion level, but handed off as needed to control by a company.  We focus on performance measures that are strongly affected by the architecture and use high-level queuing and Markov chain models to estimate performance.</br>
