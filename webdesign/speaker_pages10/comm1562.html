<br>Title: Is Taller Always Better?  Configuring a Storage Area for Person-on-Board Order Picking</br><br>Author: Russell Meller, University of Arkansas, Department of Industrial Engineering, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, rmeller@uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pratik Parikh</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The conventional assumption in configuring a storage area for person-on-board order picking is that taller is always better since taller systems increase storage density.  Increasing storage density also reduces the length of the pick tour in the order picking area.  So what could be wrong with this assumption?  We present the answer to that question by developing an analytical model of this design problem and show that taller is not always better.</br>
