<br>Title: Multiple Scenario Approach for the Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows</br><br>Author: Maciek Nowak, Assistant Professor, Loyola University, 1 E. Pearson Ave., Chicago, IL, 60611, United States of America, mnowak4@luc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Barrett Thomas</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We solve the Dynamic PDP with Time Windows through a multiple scenario approach that generates numerous routing schemes at each time period.  A consensus scheme is selected by a principal function that calls a deterministic PDPTW algorithm for route generation.  The route generation algorithms used include both a cutting edge exact solution method and a simple local search heuristic.  A comparison of these methods allows for an exploration of the value of an exact algorithm in route generation.</br>
