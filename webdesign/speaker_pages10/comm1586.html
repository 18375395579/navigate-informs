<br>Title: A Link Based Dynamic Network Loading Model</br><br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sukkusur@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Feng Zhu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study develops a new link based dynamic network loading model which is efficient in large scale simulation and readily applicable for analytical analysis. Shockwave propagation is well captured by checking the difference of queue forming and dissipation end. A small numerical example is compared with Cell Transmission Model and Point Queue model, confirming the model? accuracy in travel time estimation. Two more tests are conducted on a hypothetical network and the Manhattan network, confirming the model? efficiency in large scale network simulation.</br>
