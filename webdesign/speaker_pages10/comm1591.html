<br>Title: Gradual Coverage in Location Set Covering Problem (LSCP)</br><br>Author: Vladimir Marianov, Professor, Department of electrical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, RM, Chile, marianov@ing.puc.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): H.A. Eiselt</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We review and propose different forms to soften the coverage function in the LSCP. The formulations either penalize excessive customer ?facility distances, or require some proportion of customers to receive service within a specified distance, while the remaining customers receive at least a secondary level of service, or maximize the minimum level of service. We also analyze the case in which there is congestion. The approaches are compared with respect to their practicability.</br>
