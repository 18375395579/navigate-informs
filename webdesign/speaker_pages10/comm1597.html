<br>Title: Control for a System of PHEV Charging Stations</br><br>Author: Asama Kulvanitchaiyanunt, University of Texas at Arlington, 500 West First Street, 420 Woolf Hall, Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, asama.kulvanitchaiyanunt@mavs.uta.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victoria C Chen, Jay Rosenberger, Wei-jen Lee, Janet Allen, Amirhossein Khosrojerdi, Piampoom Sarikprueck, Farrokh Mistree</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Dynamic control of a system of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging stations is studied. As an initial analysis, the mean value problem is formulated as a deterministic linear program. Multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between the objective function and station locations with number of slots per station. Future work discusses a value iteration approach based on design and analysis of computer experiments to solve the infinite-horizon dynamic program.</br>
