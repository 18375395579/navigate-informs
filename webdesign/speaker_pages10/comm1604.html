<br>Title: No More Freeways: Urban System Dynamics Without Freeway Capacity Expansion</br><br>Author: Lei Zhang, Assistant Professor, Oregon State University, School of Civil & Construction Engineering, 220 Owen Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331, United States of America, imleich@yahoo.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The limits of freeway capacity expansion have resulted in a provocative urban transportation planning and policy question: What if we stop building additional freeway capacity. Using an agent-based simulator of land use-transportation evolution, this paper explores: 1. How urban land use and transportation network evolve under a “No-More-Freeway?policy; 2. What are the implications of such a policy on congestion, land use efficiency, transportation finance, and welfare.</br>
