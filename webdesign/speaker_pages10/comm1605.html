<br>Title: A Taxiway Planning Model Considering Runway Exit Selection for Landing Aircrafts</br><br>Author: Wenda Liu, Tsinghua University, Main Building 616, Beijing, China, momo.63@163.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mo Yang, Peng Cheng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The efficiency of taxi process restricts the full use of airport runway capacity. We investigate the taxiway planning problem and discuss the significance of runway exit selection for landing aircrafts. A model based on mixed integer programming is proposed for the assignment of taxi routes and times. We test the model performance with taxiway operations of Beijing Capital International Airport. About 6.5 percent of taxi time can be saved, and calculation time is acceptable for application.</br>
