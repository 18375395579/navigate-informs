<br>Title: Using Location Modeling Framework to Optimally DistributeTraffic and Storage Usage for Web Services</br><br>Author: Hongzhong Jia, Researcher, Microsoft, 1065 La Avenida ST, Mountain View, CA, 94043, United States of America, billjia@microsoft.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A web service often needs to host numerous users that store and access their online data. To provide services, the hardware is purchased and configured as nodes, each hosting a number of users. Built at different times, the nodes have distinct traffic processing capability and storage capacity. We present a modeling framework to allocate the user traffic and storage across the heterogeneous nodes. The framework enables the web services to achieve the maximal capacity and the best performance.</br>
