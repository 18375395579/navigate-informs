<br>Title: Modeling the Information Propagation in Transportation Networks</br><br>Author: ManWo Ng, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Texas at Austin, ECJ Hall 6.2, 1 University Station C1761, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, mwng@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dung-Ying Lin, S. Travis Waller</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Travel information provision to road users is crucial in routing problems. Traditionally, information is collected through sensors and communicated to users by infrastructures that typically require substantial investments. Here, we consider a more cost effective alternative: vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication as a means of providing online travel time information. The first step is to understand how information spreads in a V2V system. To this end, we will present a simple model.</br>
