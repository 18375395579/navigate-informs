<br>Title: Bounds on Survival Probability of Random Walk with Memory on Fortified Arcs of a Directed Network</br><br>Author: Sadie Thomas, Graduate Student, University of Florida, 302B Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States of America, sadiethomas@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A random walk begins at a node of a directed network and seeks the destination node. The walk can fail at each arc traversal with a given probability, resulting in the failure of the walk. Once an arc is successfully crossed, the walk cannot fail on it if crossed again. Additionally, each arc can be fortified to ensure an increased probability of successful traversal. The total cost of arc fortification is limited. We develop bounds for the probability of such a random walk’s success.</br>
