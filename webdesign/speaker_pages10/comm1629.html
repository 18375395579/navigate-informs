<br>Title: Determination of the Optimal Placement of Point Detectors on Virginia’s Freeways</br><br>Author: Praveen Edara, Research Scientist, Virginia Transportation Research Council, 530 Edgemont Road, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States, Praveen.Edara@VDOT.Virginia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brian Smith, Jianhua Guo, Cathy McGhee</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A decision support tool to identify the best locations of a finite set of point detectors on a freeway corridor is developed in this research.  The objective function, minimization of the travel time estimation error, is formulated as a combinatorial optimization program and solved for a good solution using metaheuristics.</br>
