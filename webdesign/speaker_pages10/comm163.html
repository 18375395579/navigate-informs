<br>Title: Using Composite Variable Modeling to Solve Integrated Freight Transportation Planning Problems</br><br>Author: Sarah Root, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, seroot@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Amy Cohn</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Developing plans for a small package carrier is a complex process, with many interdependent and constrained resources. As a result, the process is often decomposed into sequential steps, which can greatly impact solution quality. We present a modeling approach, solution techniques, and computational results to integrate three of these sequential sub-problems: the assignment of packages to trailer types, the routing and matching of trailers, and the balancing of empties.</br>
