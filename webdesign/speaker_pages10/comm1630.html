<br>Title: Integrated Rail Service Network Design Model</br><br>Author: Endong Zhu, Ph.D. student, Universit?de Montréal, CIRRELT, C.P. 6128, succ. Centre-ville, Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada, endong@crt.umontreal.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Michel Gendreau</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Service network design for rail transportation concerns the selection and scheduling of train services, car distribution, blocking and train make-up policies. A two-layer time-space network is proposed to model the traffic flow and the decisions on blocks and services. The MIP model is difficult and heuristic methods are explored.</br>
