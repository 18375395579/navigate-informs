We tackle both AGV and ASC planning, scheduling and routing. Other topics covered are stacking, terminal transport planning and rail / barge interfaces. Next we show the evolution of the terminal concepts in time and compare them with another automated terminal, HHLA in Hamburg. Finally we sketch a number of open OR problems.</br>
