<br>Title: Bus Fleet Replacement Optimization Framework with Real World Fleet Data</br><br>Author: Miguel Figliozzi, Associate Professor, Portland State University, P.O. Box 751 CEE, OR 97207-075, Portland, OR, United States of America, figliozzi@pdx.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Feng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a bus fleet replacement optimization framework that incorporates real-world bus fleet utilization, fuel economy, maintenance cost data and optimization models. Both an integer programming model and a stochastic dynamic programming model are formulated to provide optimal fleet replacement decisions under heterogeneous and homogeneous fleet assumptions.</br>
