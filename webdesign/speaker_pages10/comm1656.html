<br>Title: Mixed Integer Programming for Capacity Analysis of a Single Track Railway Part I: Two Train Types</br><br>Author: Matthew Petering, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee, P.O. Box 784, EMS E367, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States of America, mattpete@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dietrich Bergmann, Mojtaba Heydar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the capacity of a single track, unidirectional rail line. A set of intermediate stations lies between an origin and destination with one siding at each station. Two train types—express and local—are dispatched from the origin. A mixed integer program is developed to measure the capacity of the railway. Constraints include a maximum total dwell time for the local train and headway considerations on the main line and in stations. Hundreds of problem instances are solved to optimality.</br>
