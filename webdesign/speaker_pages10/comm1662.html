<br>Title: Improving Observability and Controllability of Dynamic Traffic Systems using Sensor Networks</br><br>Author: Kuilin Zhang, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S Cass Ave Bldg. 222, Lemont, IL, 60439, United States of America, kzhang@anl.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuesong Zhou</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Observability and Controllability are mathematical duals in a system. We propose a novel model and innovative approach to identify the optimal sensor network design that can improve observability and controllability of dynamic traffic systems, whose observations are sufficient to detect traffic states for traffic information provision, and to estimate and predict dynamic traffic states such as origin-destination demand flows, traffic flows, and travel time, as well as whose control is sufficient to control the traffic system dynamics through integrated traffic control and management strategies.</br>
