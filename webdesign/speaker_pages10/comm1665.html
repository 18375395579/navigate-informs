<br>Title: Stochastic Modeling of the Traveling Salesman Problem</br><br>Author: Jay Brown, Kent State University, College of Business Administration, Kent, OH, 44242, United States of America, jrbrown@kent.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alfred Guiffrida</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is approached from a stochastic perspective and modeled from results gained from simulations of randomly generated TSPs based on factors such as region size and shape, number of customers, and depot location.  Stochastic modeling improves the quality of information available for planning and offers the ability to gauge the probabilistic likelihood of costs associated with optimal tours.</br>
