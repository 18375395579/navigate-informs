<br>Title: Procuring Transportation for US Food Aid</br><br>Author: Ozlem Ergun, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, oergun@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Owen Carroll, Justin Stowe, Steven Butt, Emily Sarver, Jan Zhang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The US sends food aid through the Food for Peace program.  Each month, an invitation to bid is published to acquire and transport food commodities. After the government receives all bids from commodity suppliers and ocean carriers, it awards contracts so that the total cost is minimized. We discuss an analytical tool that uses forecasting techniques, an optimization model to simulate the contract awarding process, and analysis tools to aid the ocean carriers in selecting the best bid price.</br>
