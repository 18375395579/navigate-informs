<br>Title: A Solution Procedure for Broadband Convergence Access Network Design Problem</br><br>Author: Hyunjung Yun, Korea University, Sungbuk Ku Anamdong, Seoul, Korea, Republic of, hjyun@korea.ac.kr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Youngho Lee, Youngjin Kim, Junghee Han, Kyunam Chang, Youngwook Kim, Bongju Kwon, Kyungsoo Kong</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a physical network design problem of broadband convergence access network. We formulate the problem as a three-level capacitated facility location-allocation model that minimizes the total cost, while satisfying nonlinear QoS constraints. The proposed branch and bound procedure finds the optimal solution within ten minutes for real problem instances.</br>
