<br>Title: An Integrated Approach to Improve Bike Sharing Rebalancing Operations</br><br>Author: Robert Regue, PhD Candidate, University of California, Irvine, Institute of Transportation Studies, 4000 Anteater Instruction and Research B, Irvine, CA, 92617, United States of America, rreguegr@uci.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Will Recker</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Daily rebalancing operations in Bike Sharing systems are required to deliver a good level of service. The proposed approach first determines optimal inventory ranges based on historical data. Secondly, future inventory levels are forecasted using machine-learning techniques at three different time steps and optimal pickups and drop offs are computed solving a linear integer problem. Finally, a vehicle routing problem is solved in a rolling horizon fashion to determine optimal vehicle routes.</br>
