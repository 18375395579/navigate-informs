<br>Title: Environmental Factors in Stochastic Optimization Problems in Air Transportation</br><br>Author: Terry Thompson, Director, Strategic Development, Metron Aviation, 45300 Catalina Court, Suite 101, Dulles, VA, 20166, United States of America, thompson@metronaviation.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss on-going research in stochastic optimization problems in air transportation involving both operational efficiency and environmental goals and constraints.  The environmental perspective involves objectives associated with climate, local air quality, and noise effects.  These objectives operate on significantly different time scales and across different affected populations, leading to challenging problem formulations.</br>
