<br>Title: Short-notice, Multi-modal Evacuation Modeling</br><br>Author: Mark Hickman, University of Arizona, Civil Engineering, PO Box 210072, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0072, United States of America, mhickman@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chang Chiu, Hyunsoo Noh</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A major flooding event is considered for short-notice evacuation modeling. Both the evacuation of persons by automobiles and the evacuation of the carless by transit buses are considered. An actual flooding scenario from Phoenix, Arizona is used to illustrate the evacuation needs and the potential evacuation strategies that could be employed. Both modeling and computational aspects are discussed.</br>
