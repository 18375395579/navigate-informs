<br>Title: Supply Chain Network Models for Humanitarian Logistics: Identifying Synergies and Vulnerabilities</br><br>Author: Anna Nagurney, John F. Smith Memorial Professor, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, nagurney@gbfin.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Trisha Woolley, Qiang Qiang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper describes how supply chain network models can be utilized for humanitarian logistics. We discuss issues such as congestion, multicriteria decision-making, as well as the optimization of the delivery of multiple products subject to capacities in the storage and distribution facilities and the transportation links. We  identify synergies through the teaming of humanitarian organizations and also discuss appropriate measures for vulnerability analysis.</br>
