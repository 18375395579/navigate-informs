<br>Title: Airline Passenger Trip Reliability for U.S. Domestic Routes</br><br>Author: Lance Sherry, Associate Professor, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive MS4A6, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, lsherry@gmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Previous research has identified the discrepancy between flight performanceand passenger trip performance, and has developed algorithms for theestimation of passenger trip performance from publicly available data. This paper describes an analysis of passenger trip delays for 5224 routesbetween 309 air ports in the U.S. air transportation system for 2007. Analysis of passenger trip delays for routes and airports, and theimplications of these results are also discussed.</br>
