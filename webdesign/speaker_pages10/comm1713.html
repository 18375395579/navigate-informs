<br>Title: Relating Tolls to the Presence of Loops in Multicommodity Flows</br><br>Author: Robert Abrams, Professor, University of Illinois, Information and Decision Sciences, 601 S Morgan, Chicago, IL, 60607-7124, United States of America, rabrams@uic.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jane Hagstrom</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Given a desired traffic flow in a network, nonnegative commodity-independent tolls can be added to costs to create a Wardrop equilibrium if and only if the given traffic flow does not contain a multicommodity/single-commodity loop in the sense of Gallager (1977).  We relate such loops to the necessity/possibility of commodity-independent, commodity-dependent, or negative tolls using a theorem of the alternative.  We show by example that commodity-dependent tolls can reduce total user costs.</br>
