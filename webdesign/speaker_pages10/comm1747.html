<br>Title: Cross-dock Design and Door Assignment Properties</br><br>Author: Hector Carlo, Assistant Professor, University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez, Department of Industrial Engineering, P.O. Box 9043, Mayaguez, PR, 00981, Puerto Rico, hcarlo@uprm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yavuz Bozer</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine the optimal shape of a rectangular cross-dock and the best door locations relative to travel distances. Also, several properties of optimal outbound trailer-to-door assignments are identified for certain types of flows. Results for some properties pertaining to “alternating doors?assignments, and “volatile?and “narrow range?trailers are presented.</br>
