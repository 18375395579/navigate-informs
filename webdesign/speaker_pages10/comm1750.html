<br>Title: Modeling an Airline’s use of New Aircraft Concepts under Environmental Constraints</br><br>Author: Isaac Tetzloff, Graduate Research Assistant, Purdue University, 701 W. Stadium Ave, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, isaact@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Crossley</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: To know the environmental impact of new aircraft, we need to represent how a profit-seeking airline will use the new aircraft. Modeling the airline’s decision making process through an aircraft allocation and fleet assignment problem help evaluate the best way to represent the airline and strike a balance between the realism of the model and computational effort. This model evaluates the airline’s use of new aircraft in response to various environmental constraints, particularly related to CO2.</br>
