<br>Title: Crew Planning under Train Schedule Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Xiaoyan Si, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, june_si@utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anant Balakrishnan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a model and methods for crew repositioning in U. S. freight railroads while explicitly considering the uncertainties in train arrival and departure times.  The model minimize the total expected cost for deadheading, holding crew members at the away station, and delaying trains due to crew shortage.  We compare the operational performance of the best policy and several intuitive rules to generate insights to guide crew planning policies when train schedules are uncertain.</br>
