<br>Title: Computational Methods for Investigating Intradriver Heterogeneity using Vehicle Trajectory Data</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Taylor, University of Utah, 5966 West 3500 South, Salt Lake City, UT, United States of America, jeff.d.taylor@utah.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuesong Zhou</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We extend Newell's car-following model to incorporate time-dependent parameters, and use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm for model calibration. By synthesizing NGSIM driver trajectory data, we will examine driver heterogeneity in car-following behavior, as well as the driver's heterogeneous situation-dependent behavior within a trip.</br>
