<br>Title: Intelligent Agent Strategies for Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems</br><br>Author: Martijn Mes, Assistant professor, University of Twente, P.O. Box 217, Enschede, 7500 AE, Netherlands, m.r.k.mes@utwente.nl</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study a pickup and delivery problem where time-sensitive jobs are offered through sequential auctions, and where a fixed set of vehicles compete with each other to service these jobs. We model this as a multi-agent system consisting of shipper agents and vehicle agents that both apply profit maximizing look-ahead strategies. We use simulation to study the impact of applying these local strategies - in the absence of any form of central coordination - on the system-wide logistical costs.</br>
