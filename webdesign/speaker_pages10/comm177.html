<br>Title: Mixed Integer Programming for Capacity Analysis of a Single Track Railway Part II: Generalized Model</br><br>Author: Mojtaba Heydar, PhD Candidate, University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee, P.O. Box 784, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States of America, mheydar@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Petering, Dietrich Bergmann</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a generalized mixed integer program for analyzing the capacity of a single track, unidirectional rail line. Our MIP model can handle (1) more than one siding per station, (2) more than two train types, and (3) different origins and destinations for each train type. Several heuristic and exact methods are employed in preliminary phases to properly set up the model, allowing CPLEX 11.2 to find optimal solutions to hundreds of large problem instances in a surprisingly short time.</br>
