<br>Title: Rapidly Detecting an Anomaly Spreading Stochastically on a Network</br><br>Author: David Morton, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, morton@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Hasenbein, Jinho Lee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider an anomaly that spreads according to stochastic dynamics on a network. Subject to a budget constraint, we install sensors on nodes of the network to maximize the probability we detect the anomaly by a time threshold. Using a Monte Carlo approximation of a stochastic integer program, we solve large-scale problem instances using data from a cellphone service provider.</br>
