<br>Title: Modular Abstract Self-learning Tabu Search</br><br>Author: Michael Ciarleglio, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States, michael.ciarleglio@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. Wesley Barnes</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A general-purpose optimization engine, MASTS (Modular Abstract Self-Learning Tabu Search), employs advanced tabu search techniques including dynamic neighborhood selection and rule based objectives.  The MASTS framework includes tools for solution archiving and parallel computations, and can be adapted to a variety of multi-criteria problems.  In conservation planning for endangered species, MASTS incorporates novel methods for optimizing the geometric layout of conservation areas.</br>
