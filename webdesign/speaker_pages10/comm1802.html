<br>Title: Mathematical Models for Transportation Lane Aggregation and Short Haul Lane Pricing</br><br>Author: Qi Yuan, Supply Chain Research Analyst, Niagara Bottling, 10312 Sparkling Dr Unit 1, Rancho Cucamonga, CA, 91730, United States of America, freestander@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaoyan Zhu, Ryan Kieczykowski, Bhaskar Tatke</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: To solve the problem of customers?demand variability in transportation lanes, we developed an innovative model to aggregate the lanes using cluster-based method. We also proposed an improved pricing model to guarantee fair pricing on short haul lanes. As a result, the spot loads are greatly reduced due to decreased variability and carriers are also willing to reserve more consistent capacity for the shipping company, which in turn increases the customer service level.</br>
