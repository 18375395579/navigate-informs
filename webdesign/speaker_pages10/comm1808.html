<br>Title: Analysis of Clandestine Networks using Reliability Properties in Multistate Systems</br><br>Author: Edward Pohl, Associate Professor, University of Arkansas, Department of Industrial Engineering, Bell Engineering Center, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, epohl@uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mauricio Guzman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This study analyzes the reliability level in a clandestine network having a flow of at least d units of influence, from a given source to a target, with looses in some nodes. An algorithm finds the reliability when the nodes are treated as non-identical components using a k-out-of-n:G system structure.</br>
