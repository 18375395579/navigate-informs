<br>Title: Vehicle Routing with Time Windows and Time-dependent Rewards: A Problem from the American Red Cross</br><br>Author: Jinxin Yi, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, United States, Jinxin.Yi@sas.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Scheller-Wolf</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe a vehicle routing problem faced by the American Red Cross (ARC). ARC must decide from which sites to retrieve blood and how their shuttles should be routed in order to provide them with a sufficient amount of platelets at minimum transportation costs. The volume of blood received at a site is time-dependent. We develop a new approach to solve this problem optimally. Application to actual ARC data indicates potential savings of 60%.</br>
