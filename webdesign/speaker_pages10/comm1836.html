<br>Title: A Mathematical Model for Optimizing the Management of Empty Railcars</br><br>Author: David De Almeida, Research Project Manager, SNCF, 45 Rue de Londres, 75379 Paris Cedex 08, Paris, France, david.de_almeida@sncf.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Romain Wlodarczyk, Christian Weber</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This presentation describes a mathematical model designed to optimize the management of empty railcars. Available railcars of different types must be allocated to demands and positioned with a minimal travelling cost and a maximum reliability (travel times are not deterministic). In some instances, demands may actually be intermediate stops where railcars need to be charged in order to fulfill final demands.</br>
