<br>Title: Scheduling and Transportation in the Construction Industry</br><br>Author: Johan Oppen, Assosiate Professor, Høgskolen i Molde, Britvegen 2, Molde, 6410, Norway, johan.oppen@himolde.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anastasia Rubasheuskaya</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a real-world planning problem faced by many companies in the construction industry. Given a number of jobs or projects, where each job has a known location, estimated duration and demand of materials, the problem is to assign projects to teams of workers, schedule the projects for each team, and construct a transportation plan for how to supply the projects with the needed materials. We use asphalt spreading as an example, and show that the problem can be modelled as a combined scheduling and routing problem. Possible solution approaches are discussed.</br>
