<br>Title: Managing Public Bike Sharing Systems by Demand Profile and Temporary Manpower Allocation</br><br>Author: I-Lin Wang, Associate Professor, Department of Industrial and Information Management, National Cheng Kung University, No.1 University Rd., Tainan, Taiwan - ROC, ilinwang@mail.ncku.edu.tw</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the surveyed OD demand profile as a fixed input that defines the bikes emanating from each station in a proportional fashion. To achieve better service quality without moving bikes among stations by bike-repositioning vehicles, our first model calculates where and when to put caretakers for receiving more bikes in over-capacitated stations, whereas our second model seeks the best amount of volunteer riders to be invited for riding between some OD links at specific periods.</br>
