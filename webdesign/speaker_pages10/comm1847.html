<br>Title: Equitable Resource Allocation Mechanisms During Reduced Airspace Capacity</br><br>Author: Kleoniki Vlachou, University of Maryland, 1173 Glenn L. Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, kvlachou@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Lovell, Michael Ball</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Part of the Airspace Flow Programs is the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program, where customers are allowed to submit cost-weighted sets of alternative trajectory options for their flights. In this research we propose a meaningful way for carriers to express some preference structure during AFP. We also propose a resource mechanism allocation that will improve the system efficiency and at the same time will take into account the preferences of the airlines.</br>
