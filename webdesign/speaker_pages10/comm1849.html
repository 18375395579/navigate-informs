<br>Title: Optimization-based Approaches to Assigning Sorority Sisters to Rooms and Roommates</br><br>Author: Xing Li, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, xingl@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zixiao Chen, Rachel Froelich, Jon Lee, Mark Daskin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Every semester, the Alpha Phi Sorority University of Michigan Chapter needs to assign enrolled sisters to different capacity apartments of the sorority in considering each individual’s room as well as roommate preference. We address this issue by using mixed-integer linear programming and heuristic algorithms to make optimal level assignment decisions that can be repeated every semester.</br>
