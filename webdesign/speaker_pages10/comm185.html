<br>Title: Dynamic Vehicle Routing under Real-time Congestion and Incident Information for JIT Logistics</br><br>Author: Ali R. Guner, PhD Candidate, Wayne State University, 4815 Fourth St., Detroit, MI, 48202, United States of America, ali@aguner.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ratna Babu Chinnam, Alper E. Murat</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a dynamic vehicle routing model in stochastic nonstationary road networks which integrates recurring and incident-based nonrecurring congestion models using real-time traffic and incident information. We illustrate the effectiveness of jointly modeling recurring and nonrecurring congestion in reducing travel time delay and variability. Our results are illustrated on a real case study from Southeast Michigan region.</br>
