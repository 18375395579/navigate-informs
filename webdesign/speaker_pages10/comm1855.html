<br>Title: Factors Influencing Robustness of Airline Operations</br><br>Author: Lavanya Marla, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 1-235, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, lavanya@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Virot Chiraphadhanakul, Cynthia Barnhart</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Robust solutions help airlines manage uncertainty and improve operations and costs incurred. We examine the networks and operations of several carriers to identify factors contributing to robustness. In addition, we analyze different approaches to generating robust solutions through experiments, and gain insights into their performance.</br>
