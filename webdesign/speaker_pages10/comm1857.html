<br>Title: The Vehicle Routing Problem Applied To Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles: A New Variant</br><br>Author: Rafael Aleman, Graduate Research Assistant, Wright State University, 207 Russ Center, 3640 Colonel Glen Highway, Dayton, OH, 45435, United States, aleman.2@wright.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xinhui Zhang, Raymond Hill</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the mathematical model and heuristic algorithms to solve the assignment of a set of mobile military targets to a set of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) over time minimizing the total travel distance. We solve this problem as a vehicle routing problem (VRP) using innovative mechanisms and introduce a new variant of the VRP where customers are served at different locations over time. Our approach provides good solutions in a reasonable computational time.</br>
