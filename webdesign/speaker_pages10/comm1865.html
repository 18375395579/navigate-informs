<br>Title: An Integrated Systems Approach to the Development of Winter Maintenance Systems</br><br>Author: Wooseung Jang, University of Missouri - Columbia, E3437 Lafferre Hall, Columbia, MO, United States, jangw@missouri.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cerry Klein, James Noble</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Winter road maintenance operations require many complex strategic and operational decisions. This research presents a systematic, heuristic-based optimization approach to integrate planning decisions for depot location, sector design, vehicle route design, vehicle scheduling, and fleet configuration. The approach is illustrated through a rural transportation network in Boone County, Missouri.</br>
