<br>Title: Line Capacity Modeling Techniques and Tools</br><br>Author: Steven Harrod, Assistant Professor, University of Dayton, 1143 Ashburton Dr., Dayton, OH, 45459, United States of America, a2soft@aol.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Line capacity models either estimate the maximum number of train paths for a given network or the timetable robustness for a given train volume. Methods are further divided by whether most trains run to a timetable, or are unscheduled. This presentation will review parametric, optimization, and simulation approaches.</br>
