<br>Title: Monetarized Effects of Runway Capacity Constraints on Airlines Schedules</br><br>Author: Stephane Cohen, Graduate Student Researcher, NEXTOR, 107 Mc Laughlin Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94705, United States of America, stephane.cohen@berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Runway capacity constraints at US airports are likely to change airlines schedules pattern. Flights may be rescheduled to the off-peak period, inducing a cost for both airlines and passengers. The goal of this paper is to study the extend to which airline schedules are affected by runway capacity constraints and to monetarize these effects.</br>
