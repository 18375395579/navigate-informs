<br>Title: Models for Air Cargo Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Joern Meissner, Professor, Kuehne Logistics University, Brooktorkai 20, Hamburg, 20457, Germany, joe@meiss.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Glazebrook, Emily Cookson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Air cargo revenue management can be described as the integrated management of aircraft cargo weight and volume constraints and chargeable cargo rates. The Air Cargo industry faces some unique challenges: Highly volatile demand, weight/volume uncertainty through variable tendering and very short booking cycles are some of the features. We develop a new dynamic programming formulation with potential to aid an air cargo company to maximize its expected profit under these challenges.</br>
