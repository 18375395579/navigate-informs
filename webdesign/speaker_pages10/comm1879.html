<br>Title: Calculation of En Route Delay Due to Vectoring and Holding</br><br>Author: Ken Wright, Lead Simulation Modeling Engineer, CAASD/MITRE, 7515 Colshire Avenue, McLean, VA, 22102, United States, kwright@mitre.org</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: CAASD has developed an algorithm that measures the delay flights accrue from vectoring and holding and has created a detailed archive going back five years. For many major airports delay from vectoring is higher than delay from airborne holding. Vectoring delay is an important metric for assessing new technologies and procedures that are designed to generate fuel savings and reduce workload for controllers. This paper describes the math behind CAASD’s vectoring algorithm and explores trends.</br>
