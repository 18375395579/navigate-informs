<br>Title: Price of Anarchy in Dynamic Traffic Networks: A Computational Study</br><br>Author: Satish Ukkusuri, Associate Professor, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, G175F, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sukkusur@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kien Doan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Price of Anarchy is described as the worst case difference between the equilibrium and optimum solution thereby measuring the inefficiency in traffic networks. This study will demonstrate the price of anarchy in dynamic traffic networks. A brief review of the dynamic equilibrium and dynamic system optimum models will be provided. Extensive computational analysis will demonstrate the price of anarchy in various traffic networks. Open questions of interest to the research community will be discussed.</br>
