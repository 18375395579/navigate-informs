<br>Title: An Optimal Lane-based Signal Merge Control Model for Freeway Work Zone Operations</br><br>Author: Yue Liu, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, P.O. Box 784, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, United States of America, liu28@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jing Mao</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic control model for optimizing lane-based signal merge (LBSM) operations at freeway work zones. The control objective is to maximize the throughput. GA is employed to solve the model. Results reveal that the proposed method yields much better performance than traditional merge strategies under heavy traffic conditions.</br>
