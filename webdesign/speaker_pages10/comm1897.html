<br>Title: Container Pickup Sequencing and the Impact on Rehandles at Marine Terminals</br><br>Author: Wenjuan Zhao, Graduate Student, Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, United States of America, wz@u.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anne Goodchild</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In a container yard, reducing the number of re-handles reduces cost, handling time, and therefore delay time to the truck waiting for container drop-off or pick-up.  This paper explores the relationship between re-handling work for import containers given sequence, and partial sequence information for arriving import trucks.  Statistical methods and simulation are employed to estimate efficiency improvements made possible through truck arrival sequence information.</br>
