<br>Title: Application of Queuing Models to Assess the Value of 4DT Trajectory Performance</br><br>Author: Mark Hansen, Professor, U.C. Berkeley, 114 McLaughlin Hall, U.C. Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, mhansen@ce.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Future concepts for the National Aviation System emphasize the use of 4D trajectories (4DTs) as a means of increasing efficiency. We investigate the use of queuing models to assess the value of precise 4DT adherence. Comparison of stochastic and deterministic models allows an estimate of the delay savings of a shift from a highly stochastic system to one with perfect 4DT adherence.  Alternatives for modeling intermediate cases, featuring improved but not perfect precision, are also presented.</br>
