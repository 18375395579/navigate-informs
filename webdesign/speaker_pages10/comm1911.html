<br>Title: A Methodology for Consolidating Multiple Fire Stations with Traffic Signal Preemption</br><br>Author: Bryan A. Norman, PhD, University of Pittsburgh, 1033 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, banorman@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lin Wang, Ming-En Wang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Many cities in the U.S. are now facing the difficult decision of closing some of their firehouses due to budget cuts. We investigate methods to decide which firehouses to close in a given fire district in order to minimize the increase in the average response time. We also consider which traffic locations should receive Traffic Signal Preemption equipment to help mitigate the effect of firehouse closures. Numerical examples based on a map of the City of Pittsburgh show results for each scenario.</br>
