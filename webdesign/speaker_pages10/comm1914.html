<br>Title: Solving a Practical Newspaper Delivery Problem</br><br>Author: Tonci Caric, Assistant Professor, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering, Vukeliceva 4, Zagreb, HR, 10000, Croatia, tonci.caric@fpz.hr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ante Galic, Hrvoje Gold</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Newspaper distribution company daily delivers newspapers to news stands in Zagreb, Croatia. Problem is recognized as the Pick-up and Delivery VRPTW. Initial solution for the problem is obtained by CWTDH algorithm which is further optimized using SA metaheuristics and lambda-interchange heuristics. Also, post optimisation technique was used for single route improvements. To validate the calculated solution, a test drive was performed to insure that every news stand will be served on time.</br>
