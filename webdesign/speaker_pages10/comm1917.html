<br>Title: A Randomized Procedure for the Equitable Assignment of Slots in an Air Space Flow Program</br><br>Author: Nasim Vakili, ISR, 3117 AVW Building, University of Maryland, College park, MD, 20742, United States, nasimv@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The FAA recently introduced the Airspace Flow Program (AFP) to manage airborne traffic in congested airspace.  We describe randomized procedures to allocate limited slots among carriers based on their relative preferences for delay and re-routing options.  We derive important properties of these methods with respect to fairness and their ability to satisfy carrier preferences.</br>
