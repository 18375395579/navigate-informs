<br>Title: The Unreliable Capacitated Facility Location Problem : Submodularity and Bounding Techniques</br><br>Author: Serigne Gueye, Assistant Professor, Universit?d'Avignon LIA-CERI, 339, chemin des Meinajaries, Agroparc BP 91228, Avignon, 84911, France, serigne.gueye@univ-avignon.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mozart Menezes</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The Unreliable Capacitated Facility Location Problem consists in locating facilities, with random capacities (correlated or not), to customers, in such a way to maximize the expected profit. The problem is expressed as a 2-stage stochastic program. We show that the expected profit function is always submodular, and monotone in the particular case of zero fixed cost. Upper and lower bounding techniques are proposed on randomly generated instances.</br>
