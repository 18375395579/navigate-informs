<br>Title: Increasing Network Reliability by Introducing Warehouses</br><br>Author: Christian Klaus, PhD Student, Naval Postgraduate School, 1 University Circle, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States of America, cklaus@nps.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nedialko Dimitrov</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Humanitarian assistance is often shipped using available space on regularly scheduled transportation routes.  We model the selection of warehouse locations to increase shipment reliability as a two-stage stochastic program where we first install warehouses, then the transportation routes are revealed and the shipment is executed if possible.  Computing the network's reliability given warehouse locations is #P hard.  We discuss some computational methods for finding good warehouse locations.</br>
