<br>Title: Scheduling and Long-term Pricing of Electric Vehicle Charging in Parking Lots with Shared Resources</br><br>Author: Ajay Deshpande, IBM, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States of America, ajayd@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pavankumar Murali</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: With the growth in the use of electric vehicles (EVs), management of shared charging infrastructure under varying customer demands, schedules and time-varying electricity prices presents a novel servicing opportunity. We formulate the combined pricing-scheduling problem as a quadratic integer program and propose a tractable algorithm to find long-term charging permit prices for different arrival-departure-demand bundles and the corresponding charging schedules.</br>
