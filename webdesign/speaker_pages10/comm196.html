<br>Title: Optimal Location of Public Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</br><br>Author: Ramteen Sioshansi, Assistant Professor, The Ohio State University, 240 Baker Systems, 1971 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43215, United States of America, sioshansi.1@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaomin Xi, Vincenzo Marano</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a simulation optimization based approach to optimize the location of public electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The model includes budget constraints and accounts for driving and charging behavior. We use a case study based on the central Ohio region to demonstrate the model.</br>
