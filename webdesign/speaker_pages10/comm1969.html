<br>Title: A Sequential GRASP for the Therapist Routing and Scheduling Problem</br><br>Author: Yufen Shao, Research Engineer, ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company, 3120 Buffalo Speedway, Houston, TX, 77098, United States of America, yufen.shao@exxonmobil.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ahmad Jarrah, Jonathan Bard</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This talk presents a sequential GRASP for solving a weekly routing and scheduling problem for therapists. The problem contains both fixed and flexible patients with respect to appointment times, and two grades of therapists. In Phase I, feasible solutions are constructed one therapist and one day at a time. In Phase II, a high-level neighborhood search is proposed to obtain local optima. Performance is demonstrated using real and randomly generated data sets.</br>
