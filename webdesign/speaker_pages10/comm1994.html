<br>Title: An Equity-based Algorithm to Plan A Ground Delay Program under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Avijit Mukherjee, Associate Research Scientist, University of California Santa Cruz, NASA Ames Research Center, Mail Stop 210-8, Moffett Field, CA, 94035, United States of America, avijit@ucsc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball, Robert Hoffman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for allocating landing slots to aircraft during ground delay programs. It is shown that the algorithm minimizes total expected delay, when there is a probability of the ground delay program canceling earlier than originally planned. A constrained version of the algorithm address both equity and efficiency of slot allocation. Experiments performed with realistic flight schedules exhibit superior overall performance of the algorithm compared to existing procedures.</br>
