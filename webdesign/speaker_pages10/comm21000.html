<br>Title: The Formation and Evolution of Teams in New Scientific Fields: A Hybrid Model Approach</br><br>Author: Alina Lungeanu, Northwestern University, 2240 Campus Drive, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, alina.lungeanu@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sophia D.

We propose five mechanisms that affect the likelihood of co-authorship in a scientific team.  We model the effects of these mechanisms by developing a hybrid simulation model and we compare its results with statistics from the observed longitudinal co-authorship network. This paper presents a first application of hybrid models in research examining the evolution of new scientific fields via the emergence of teams.</br>
