<br>Title: 2008 ICS Prize Winner: Fair Payments for Efficient Allocations in Public Sector Combinatorial Auctions</br><br>Author: S. Raghavan, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, The Robert H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20740, United States of America, raghavan@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bob Day</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We focus on the notion of bidder-pareto-optimal core (BPOC) prices that is viewed as being fair, and has gained prevalence among decision makers in public sector combinatorial auctions. Unfortunately, the computation of BPOC in a practical manner has been a major stumbling block to real-world implementation. Based on a mathematical programming formulation of the problem, we devise a computationally efficient constraint-generation approach to rapidly compute BPOC prices.</br>
