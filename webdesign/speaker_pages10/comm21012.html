<br>Title: Fractal Knowledge and Technological Change in Semiconductors and Disk Drives</br><br>Author: Roger Bohn, Professor, University of California - San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive #0519, IR/PS, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0519, United States, Rbohn@ucsd.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Knowledge can be modeled as a causal graph which grows as more is learned. Such graphs are fractal: parent-child relationships  become complex subgraphs as more is learned. These patterns are illustrated by semiconductor lithography  and hard disk drive head design. As product generations get smaller (Moore's Law), new physical relationships become large enough to be important. Also, incremental and radical technical change can be measured by how the graph changes.</br>
