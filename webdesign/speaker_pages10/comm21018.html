<br>Title: Human-Powered Data Management</br><br>Author: Aditya Parameswaran, Stanford University, 353 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, adityagp@cs.stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Fully automated algorithms are inadequate for many data analysis tasks, especially those involving images, video, or text. Thus, we need to combine “human computation?(or crowdsourcing) with traditional computation, to improve the process of understanding, extracting and managing data. In this talk, I will present a broad perspective of our research on this topic. I will then present details of one of the problems we have addressed: filtering large data sets with the aid of humans.</br>
