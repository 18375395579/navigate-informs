<br>Title: Mitigating Uncertainty through Decision Simulation with Stochastic Decomposition</br><br>Author: Suvrajeet Sen, Professor, University of Southern California, Epstein Department of ISE, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, sen.22@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yifan Liu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Three popular OR tools, namely, Decision Analysis, Linear Programming, and Simulation come together under one umbrella which we refer to as Decision Simulation.  Using stochastic decomposition (SD), we show how one can mitigate the impact of aleatoric as well as epistemic uncertainty in decision simulation.</br>
