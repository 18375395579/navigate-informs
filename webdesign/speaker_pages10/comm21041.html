<br>Title: Dynamic Feature Analysis for the Classification of Pelvic Organ Prolapse</br><br>Author: Iman Nekooyimehr, University of South Florida, 11313 N 51st street, Unit 308, Tampa, FL, 33617, United States of America, imannekooyimehr@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stuart Hart, Susana Lai-Yuen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present the analysis of dynamic-based features from medical images to improve the classification of pelvic organ prolapse cases. Pelvic organ prolapse is a common but poorly understood condition and its clinical diagnosis is currently inadequate. We analyze the movements of the pelvic organs to identify significant features for classification.</br>
