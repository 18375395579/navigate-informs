<br>Title: Global Combat Support Basing: Prepositioning Strategies for Air Force War Reserve Materiel</br><br>Author: Ronald McGarvey, Operations Researcher, RAND, 4570 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, ronm@rand.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tom Lang, Louis Luangkesorn, Rachel Rue</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The US Air Force relies on prepositioned War Reserve Materiel, stored at multiple sites across the globe, to enable global responsiveness via rapid deployments.  RAND has worked with the Air Force over a number of years, building optimization models that can help to identify prepositioning postures that can achieve the desired responsiveness at minimum cost.  Of particular interest to the current research are an examination of alternative packaging configurations and maintenance options.</br>
