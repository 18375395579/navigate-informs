<br>Title: Service Co-design</br><br>Author: Rama Akkiraju, IBM Almaden Research Center, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, CA, 95120, United States of America, akkiraju@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Traditional service design and delivery models that focus on operational excellence work well for delivering high quality but run-of-the-mill services. They are inadequate for pushing new boundaries and innovating new services. We present service co-design, a next generation service design approach to enable companies to design services that meet their growth and innovation needs.</br>
