<br>Title: Sustaining a Multi-attribute Decision Model Over Time</br><br>Author: Jim Lowe, Professor, US Air Force Academy, 2354 Fairchild Dr Ste 6H-238, US Air Force Academy, CO, 80840, United States of America, jim.lowe@usafa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gregory Seely</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: While the process of developing an initial Multi-Attribute Decision Model is well defined, sustaining such a model from year to year becomes an art.

We present results of a resource allocation model based on 25 years of implementation.</br>
