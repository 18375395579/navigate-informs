<br>Title: Command and Control for Information Age Systems</br><br>Author: Gerald Kobylski, Gerald.Kobylski@usma.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gary Smith, David Brown, Daniel Maxwell</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Recent command and control experiments indicate that future commanders will have an overwhelming number of decisions to make, just to manage their information resources.   One way to help the commander manage these decisions is to automate recurring decisions associated with managing these information collection assets.   We will demonstrate Dynamic Decision Networks (DDNs) as an approach for providing this capability to future commanders.  DDN’s are based on Bayesian Networks and Influence Diagrams and are proven to be very efficient tools for complex problems and a very good alternative for military decision makers.  The presentation includes a background of DDNs and the structure of our research effort, as well as a demonstration of a simulation that has been developed to experiment with the concept for UAV command and control.</br>
