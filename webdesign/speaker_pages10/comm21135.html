<br>Title: Teaching a Traditional Optimization Course in a Non-Traditional Manner</br><br>Author: James Orlin, Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Operations Research Center, E53-363, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, jorlin@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Metzger</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This tutorial will share what we have learned in teaching an undergraduate optimization course at MIT over the past decade. While the syllabus is traditional, the presentation of class material is not. We will share how to use PowerPoint animation for teaching algorithms and other subject material. We will also discuss a variety of approaches for keeping students engaged and interested while they learn both traditional modeling and algorithms.</br>
