<br>Title: What Skills Does Industry Want from Our Graduates?</br><br>Author: ManMohan Sodhi, Professor, Cass Business School, City University London, 106 Bunhill Row, London, --, EC1Y8TZ, United Kingdom, m.sodhi@city.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We describe the skills that industry employers seek from graduates of OR programmes with a view to motivate discussion on what should be taught and how it should be taught in OR or OM programmes. Our results are based on content analysis of detailed job ads. We also discuss what industry (implicitly) defines OR and OM to be and therefore the possible implications on education.</br>
