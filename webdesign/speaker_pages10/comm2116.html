<br>Title: Particle Filtering</br><br>Author: John Birge, Professor, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America, john.birge@chicagobooth.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Particle methods provide a robust methodology for estimation and prediction.  They can also apply to traditional operations research areas by, for example, providing an effective alternative for constructing Monte Carlo simulations of various systems and for dynamic optimization.  This tutorial explains the fundamental ideas behind particle methods and how to use them in typical operations research contexts.</br>
