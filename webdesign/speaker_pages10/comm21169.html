<br>Title: Shift Scheduling for Third Level IT Support: Challenges, Models and Case Study</br><br>Author: Dagan Gilat, Senior Manager, Business Transformation and Optimization, IBM, IBM Haifa Research Lab, Haifa University, Mount Carmel, Haifa, NA, 31905, Israel, dagang@il.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Segev Wasserkrug, Shai Taub, Sergey Zeltyn, Vladimir Lipets, Zohar Feldman, Avishai Mandelbaum</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Outsourcing IT support of an enterprise requires that third level IT support is provided as a service by an outsourcer. Despite the large body of existing work regarding demand forecasting and shift schedule creation in various domains, very little work exists for third level IT support. We present an end–to-end methodology for forecasting and scheduling this type of work, and demonstrate it in the context of a specific case study, in which significant potential savings were demonstrated.</br>
