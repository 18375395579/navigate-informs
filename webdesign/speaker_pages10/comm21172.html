<br>Title: Identifying Decision Opportunities in Building Design through Value-Focused Thinking</br><br>Author: Yun-Shang Chiou, Doctoral Student, School of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, United States, ychiou@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Johnson, Khee Poh Lam, Cliff Davidson</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Building design decisions often focus on alternatives. These decisions are intended to provide design solutions to meet defined criteria, and do not examine whether these criteria fully address design objectives. We apply value-focused thinking to the green building rating system and a high-profile construction project at a major university. We demonstrate how VFT can help designers regain a focus on values and objectives as well as identify decision opportunities that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.</br>
