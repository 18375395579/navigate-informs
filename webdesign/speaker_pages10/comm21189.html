<br>Title: Guiding School Choice Reform through Novel Applications of Operations Research</br><br>Author: Peng Shi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, pengshi@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In January 2012, Boston launched a school assignment reform. After attending many community meetings, I proposed a series of optimization-based plans to balance various objectives. I also fitted a discrete choice model and rigorously simulated alternative plans. In March 2013, Boston adopted the plan I proposed. This will benefit the 8000+ families who apply to Boston elementary schools each year.</br>
