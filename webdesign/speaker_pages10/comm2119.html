<br>Title: Impact of Errors in Operational Spreadsheets</br><br>Author: Stephen Powell, Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, United States of America, Stephen.G.Powell@tuck.dartmouth.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kenneth Baker</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We estimated the quantitative impacts of errors in 25 operational spreadsheets from five different organizations. Within these 25 spreadsheets we identified 381 potential errors, of which 117 (31%) were confirmed as errors by the developers of the spreadsheet. Among these confirmed errors, 47 (40%) had no quantitative impact on the results. Among the remaining 70 confirmed errors, the largest error was $100 million; however, 9 of the 25 spreadsheets tested had no errors at all.</br>
