However this research has not always been guided by an understanding of the complex and nuanced challenges faced by people working in disaster relief. In this paper we propose a model for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Code of Conduct (CoC) for use in relief operations.</br>
