Graphs are automatically evaluated and graded. The system uses TeX and LoadTeX to render files that are stored in a relational database. An instructor may use pre-existing graphing problems or author new ones. This system is available through Aplia,Inc, a company that has more than 80,000 ongoing students.</br>
