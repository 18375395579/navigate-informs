<br>Title: Analysis of Automobile Driving Behavior Data for New Service Concept Development</br><br>Author: Min-Jun Kim, POSTECH, Quality Systems Lab., Dept. of IME, San 31, Hyoja-dong, Nam-gu, Pohang, 790-784, Korea, Republic of, minjun@postech.ac.kr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chie-Hyeon Lim, Kwang-Jae Kim</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The digital tachograph (DTG) is a device to collect the operational data of an automobile. The driving patterns of a driver can be extracted by analyzing the DTG database. This talk presents an analysis of the driving patterns extracted from the DTG database and their impacts on the actual accident rates in Korea. This research would serve as a basis for developing the driving safety enhancement service concept.</br>
