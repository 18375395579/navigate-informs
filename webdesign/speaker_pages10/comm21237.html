<br>Title: Integrated Forest Fire Detection and Initial Attack Planning</br><br>Author: David Martell, Faculty of Forestry, University of Toronto, 33 Willcocks Street, Toronto, M5S 3B3, United States of America, martell@smokey.forestry.utoronto.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Forest fire detection system managers attempt to find and report fires at small sizes on the assumption that initial attack system performance declines as detection size increases. Detection system management is complicated by the unorganized public detection system which detects and reports many fires at little or no cost. We describe the development of an integrated detection-initial attack model and how we used it to develop detection system performance measures for the province of Ontario.</br>
