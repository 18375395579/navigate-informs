<br>Title: The Hyper-Hypergame and Evidence-Based Evaluation</br><br>Author: Doug Samuelson, Homeland Security Institute, 8711 Chippendale Court, Annandale, VA, 22003, United States, samuelsondoug@yahoo.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: As models?complexity approaches that of the actual systems of interest, traditional methods of validation are often ineffective or ethically indefensible.  These difficulties force us to reconstitute our methods of assessing the quality of models and evidence.   Extending hypergame analysis and integrating it with recent advances in philosophy of science help to address such issues.</br>
