<br>Title: How Should We Introduce OR to Undergraduate Students?</br><br>Author: David Rader, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, 5500 Wabash Ave, Terre Haute, IN, 47803, United States, david.rader@rose-hulman.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: When teaching mathematics students about OR, it is important to convey not only the fundamental problems and theory of the discipline but also what makes it such an exciting field of study.  Courses successful in motivating students highlight modeling approaches, algorithm (solution) development, and how theoretical insights from the problem affect solution approaches and improvements. Examples of these approaches from various courses are given.</br>
