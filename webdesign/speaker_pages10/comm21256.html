We describe efforts to improve Base Support Vehicle and Equipment (BSV&E) fueling operation and management.  This capability is not operated and managed at an enterprise level, with a patchwork of providers, reporting and accounting practices, regional and national stakeholders.  The authors describe how decision analysis methods were used to illuminate a path forward.</br>
