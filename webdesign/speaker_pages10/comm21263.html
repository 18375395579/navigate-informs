<br>Title: Averaging Opinions: When Does it Work Well, and When Do People Do it?</br><br>Author: Jack Soll, Assistant Professor of Management, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, jsoll@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Larrick, Al Mannes</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: People tend to “chase the expert,?preferring a chosen expert’s forecast to an average of several.
