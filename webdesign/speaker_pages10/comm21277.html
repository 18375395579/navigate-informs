<br>Title: Design of Security-constrained Workflows</br><br>Author: Dmitry Zhdanov, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Rd, Unit 1041, OPIM Dept. School of Business, Storrs, CT, 06066, United States of America, Dmitry.Zhdanov@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xue Bai, Ram Gopal, Manuel Nunez</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We describe a workflow optimization problem where information security serves as a set of constraints.  Any digital transformation that involves confidential data sequences are applicable to our model because it carries vulnerability. Examples are B2B or B2C EDI, online-banking, electronic payment systems, email exchange, where the userID, password, and other personal information should not appear available to the same information processor.</br>
