<br>Title: Applying Control Chart Methods to Enhance Data Quality</br><br>Author: Allison Jones-Farmer, Auburn University, 420 Lowder Business Building, Auburn, AL, 36849, United States of America, joneall@auburn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeremy Ezell, Benjamin Hazen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: As the volume and variety of available data grows, organizations turn to analytics to enhance decision-making; however, the decisions are only as good as the data on which they are based.  We examine the data quality problem and propose the use of control charting for data quality monitoring and improvement.  We include discussions of the data quality dimensions and highlight the lack of appropriate statistical methods for analysis.  We suggest opportunities for research within this area.</br>
