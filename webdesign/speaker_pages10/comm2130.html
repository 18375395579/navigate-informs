<br>Title: Unmanned Aircraft Systems Assessment for the Military Future</br><br>Author: Darryl Ahner, Senior Research Analyst, U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center, Naval Postgraduate School, P.O. Box 8695, Monterey, CA, 93940, United States of America, darryl.ahner@us.army.mil</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) bring a significant capability to the battlespace across a wide range of missions. This presentation addresses the methodology for identifying these missions, the populating of the number of missions for assessment, the identification of key system characteristics to be considered, and development of the operational analysis tool that determined the trade-offs between multiple proposed UAS systems.</br>
