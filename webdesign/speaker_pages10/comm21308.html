<br>Title: The Model Design and Development on Oilsands CCS in Global Integrated Assessment Model</br><br>Author: Cheng-Marshal Wang, EC, 80 Westpointe Crescent, Ottawa, ON, K2G 5Y9, Canada, Cheng-Marshal.Wang@ec.gc.ca</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We will first review the new developments of Environment Canada Integrated Assessment Model (EC-IAM), which is a global inter-temporal hybrid model combining economical module and technical module. Then we will present the current working in designing the new module of Oilsands with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology.   We have recalibrated ex-ante on the newest data and projection available and Modeling of CCS in Oil Sands sector has been conducted by some US agents but not in EC.</br>
