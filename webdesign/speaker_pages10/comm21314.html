<br>Title: Not Just for Calculating Fast Anymore: Spreadsheet as Platform</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Keisler, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts Boston, MSIS Department, 100 Morrissey Boulevard, Boston, MA, 02125, United States, Jeff.Keisler@umb.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In default mode, spreadsheets look like balance sheets so we use them for arithmetic, or with add-ins to solve well-structured problems.

We propose a regimen for exploring the possibilities and developing expertise in this regard.</br>
