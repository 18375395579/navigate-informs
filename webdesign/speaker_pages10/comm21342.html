<br>Title: A Value-driven Perspective to Architectural Stability and Evolution</br><br>Author: Rami Bahsoon, Dr, School of Engineering and Applied Sc, Aston University in Birmingham, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, UK, United Kingdom, r.bahsoon@aston.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wolfgang Emmerich</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe ArchOptions, a model that uses real options theory to value the flexibility of an architecture in face of likely changes. We highlight the model use on two cases: (i) informing the selection of middleware-induced software architecture guided by the value added in supporting likely changes in load and (ii) valuing the cost-effectiveness of investing in a refactoring exercise. We reflect on our experience in using a value-driven approach to architecture evolution decision making.</br>
