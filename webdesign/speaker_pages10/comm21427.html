<br>Title: The Dynamic Interaction of First- and Second-Order Improvement</br><br>Author: Brad Morrison, Assistant Professor, Brandeis International Business School, 415 South Street, Waltham, MA, 02454, United States of America, jbm@kurtsalmon.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A mathematical model is developed to formalize the interaction between first-order improvements that boost output from existing processes and second-order improvements that enhance the capability of underlying processes.  Results find tipping points in the dynamics of process improvement, identify perverse behaviors likely to thwart the intentions of practitioners, and show how the feedback structure of process improvement presents challenges to manage the dual pressures to produce and improve.</br>
