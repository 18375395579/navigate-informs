<br>Title: Panel Discussion: Reliability and Stochasticity in Renewable Power Systems</br><br>Author: Eunshin Byon, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States of America, ebyon@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren, David Coit, Yu Ding, Nagi Gebraeel, Shuangwen Sheng</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Renewable energy systems pose significant challenges for planning and operations due to the stochastic nature.  In this panel discussion, the panelists will share their experiences and highlight research problems that need to be addressed in future. The panelists are: Dr. Oren at University of California at Berkeley; Dr. Coit at Rutgers University; Dr. Ding at Texas A&M University; Dr. Gebraeel at Georgia Institute of Technology, Senior Engineer Dr. Sheng at National Renewable Energy Laboratory.</br>
