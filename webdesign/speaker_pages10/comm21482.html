<br>Title: Field Size Management on the PGA Tour</br><br>Author: Nicholas G. Hall, Professor, The Ohio State University, Management Sciences, 2100 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210-1144, United States of America, hall_33@fisher.osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chris Potts</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The PGA Tour faces a critical decision in setting field sizes for the third and fourth rounds of tournaments. Fairness to players and enjoyment for spectators must be balanced against speed of play and TV time constraints. Rule changes were implemented in January and March 2008. We study the performance of various cut rules, include those recently used and proposed by the players and the Tour management. Unlike the current rule, our proposed rule is sensitive to the distribution of scores.</br>
