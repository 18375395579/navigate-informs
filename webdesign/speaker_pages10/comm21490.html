Box 195, Pomona, NJ, 08240, United States of America, janet.wagner@stockton.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Originally targeted to an on-line introductory statistics course, a set of home-movies for numerous spreadsheet based examples of statistical analysis were developed.

A few examples and a discussion of multi-media technologies for use in spreadsheet based courses will be discussed.</br>
