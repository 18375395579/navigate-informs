<br>Title: Business Models and Processes for 3PL Providers</br><br>Author: Siddhartha SenGupta, Principal Scientist, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Gateway Park, 2nd flr, MIDC Road 13,, MIDC, Andheri East,, Mumbai, Ma, 400093, India, Siddhartha.SenGupta@tcs.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Economically Services are becoming increasingly more important and it would be useful to develop appropriate Business Models and Business Processes for service value chains. Here we try to Learn from the smokestacks - from the well developed Models and Processes of Manufacturing. In particular, we find that the IHIP characteristics of Services make them similar to manufacturing models where the decoupling point is away from the customer processes, e.g. in Make-To-Order. We adapt and extend the relevant methods of these models to 3PL services, especially to shipping.</br>
