<br>Title: Integrating Workforce Communication into an Engineering Introduction to Statistics Course</br><br>Author: Judith Shaul Norback, Director of Workforce & Academic Communication, School of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, judith.norback@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicoleta Serban</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: More and more employers are expecting engineering graduates to have excellent workforce communication skills. And of course universities have responded to ABET2000 by incorporating more communication skills in their undergraduate curricula.  At the Georgia Tech H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, we have identified the needed workforce communication skills by interviewing practicing engineers, supervisors and senior executives in companies employing many engineers.  The skills have been integrated through the use of projects into Introduction to Statistics.  We will describe the very positive preliminary student feedback and how to implement the process at other universities.</br>
