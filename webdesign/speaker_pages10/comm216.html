<br>Title: Reconciling Multi-strategy Game Theoretic Simulations with Cognitive Dissonance</br><br>Author: Jordan Willcox, HSCB Modeling Analyst, System of Systems Analytics, Inc., 11250 Waples Mill Road, Ste 300, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, jwillcox@sosacorp.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Game theory is sometimes used to model strategic equilibria for multiple agents, but often the behavior of the agents is dissimilar to human behavior. One example is the contrast between goal maximization and interest in relative agent status. Another is the human bias towards consistent strategies, as captured by the theory of cognitive dissonance. The author considers modifications that address these issues, and discusses integrating a cognitive dissonance model into a game-theoretic model.</br>
