<br>Title: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries</br><br>Author: Deborah Dougherty, Rotgers University, 94 Rockafeller Rd, Janice H. Levin Rm 26, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, doughert@business.rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Drug discovery has many unpredictable interdependencies. Science digitalization affords ways to measure, analyze, and model chemical compounds, diseases, and biology.We build on epistemic cultures to develop theory for integrating digital sciences. Digitalization creates essential knowledge and new knowledge boundaries around central activities of innovation. We explain how innovation activities can be transformed to integrate digital science into drug discovery.</br>
