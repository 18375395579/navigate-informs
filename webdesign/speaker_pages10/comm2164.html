<br>Title: Generalized Deviations are Counterparts to Risk Measures</br><br>Author: Stanislav Uryasev, University of Florida, uryasev@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): R. Tyrrell Rockafellar, Sergey Sarykalin, Michael Zabarankin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper overviews results on generalized deviations, including CVaR Deviation. Topics: 1) Generalized Deviations versus Risk; 2) Coherent Deviations; 3) Portfolio Optimization with Generalized Deviations; 4) Optimal Portfolio Policies with Multiple Deviations; 5) Betas for Optimal Portfolios; 6) Market Equilibrium; 7) Statistics with Generalized Deviations. We demonstrate case studies with Portfolio Safeguard by AOrDa.com: minimization of VaR, CVaR, Default Probability, and Drawdown.</br>
