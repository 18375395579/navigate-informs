<br>Title: Parallel Service Management: Better Understanding, Better Life</br><br>Author: Lefei Li, Tsinghua University, Room 608, Shunde Building, Beijing, China, lilefei@tsinghua.edu.cn</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We always say: the customer is god. However, do we really understand this ‘god? In practice, the nature of service, such as intangibility and heterogeneity, make the effective management of service operations difficult. To better incorporate human behaviors and other complex factors to facilitate service management decisions, we propose a new approach, Parallel Service Management (PSM), which follows the ACP framework,a emerging methodology in complex systems modeling and analysis. In PSM, customer agents, service employee agents, service organization agents and service environment construct an artificial service system, which can run in parallel with the real service system. In this way, the artificial system can learn from the real system dynamically. By doing vast computational experiments, we are able to feedback good decision suggestions to the real system, and therefore providing a better service to the customers.</br>
