<br>Title: Loss Given Default Modelling In Consumer Lending</br><br>Author: Lyn Thomas, Professor, University of Southampton, School of Management, Faculty of Law, Arts and Social Sciences, United Kingdom, L.Thomas@soton.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The Basel Accord has highlighted the importance of Loss Given Default modeling.  Work has focused on corporate lending, but little research has been done on consumers. We explain why one needs to model both the probability the defaulter will want to pay back anything, the uncertainty on payback amounts, but also the lender’s strategic and tactical decisions in the collections process. Using data from large portfolios, we built a model combining decision trees and generalised linear regression.</br>
