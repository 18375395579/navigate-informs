<br>Title: Umpire Crew Scheduling at the U.S. Open</br><br>Author: Adam Farmer, Logistics Engineer, The Home Depot, 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, GA, 30339, United States, afarmer80@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Smith</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Scheduling umpires at the U.S. Open can require a significant amount of time due to several factors.  The authors developed a system to automate the scheduling process and successfully implemented the system at the 2004 and 2005 U.S. Opens.  In 2006, the system was enhanced to allow for the assignment of crew chiefs and incorporate ongoing assignment history throughout the course of the tournament.  Results of the updated system’s implementation at the 2006 U.S. Open will be discussed.</br>
