<br>Title: Scheduling Final Exams at Cornell University</br><br>Author: Dmitriy Levchenkov, PhD Student, Cornell University, School of OR&IE, 295 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, levchen@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Bland, David Shmoys</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Final exams at Cornell are scheduled in 21 periods on 7 days, by first grouping all courses into 1 of 14 groups based on their class time or, for courses with multiple sections, in one of 6 exception groups. Student complaints about taking 3 exams in a day or 2 consecutive exams prompted us to develop an IP approach to the problem. This approach has been adopted here with great success.  Somewhat surprisingly, the solution of the required IPs has not been an obstacle in this work at all.</br>
