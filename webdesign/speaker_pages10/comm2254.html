<br>Title: Introducing Integer Modeling with Excel Solver to Business Students</br><br>Author: Dessislava Pachamanova, Assistant Professor, Babson College, 319 Babson Hall, Babson Park, MA, 02457, United States, dpachamanova@babson.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a simple example for introducing integer modeling of fixed costs with Excel Solver to business students. The example uses  concepts from accounting (assessing distribution channel profitability), and blends them with management science techniques. The effectiveness of the software use is in integrating it successfully into a comprehensive discussion about assumptions, modeling, limitations, software pitfalls, validation, and implications for managerial decision making.</br>
