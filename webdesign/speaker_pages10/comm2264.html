By looking to the future and designing Joint Operations Concepts, the Joint Experimentation Transformation Concept Division of the Joint Staff J7 introduces new ideas to improve joint operations and capabilities.  Through a process known as Joint Experimentation, which is based upon the future Joint Operations Concepts, the military can gain insights designed to produce results to shape Joint Force Development.  This is a deliberate, iterative and continuous process of planning and developing that transforms the current force into a future joint force.</br>
