<br>Title: Global (and Local Nonlinear) Optimization in Integrated Computing Systems</br><br>Author: Janos D. Pinter, Pintér Consulting Services, Inc., 129 Glenforest Drive, Halifax, NS, Canada, jdpinter@hfx.eastlink.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Integrated scientific-technical computing (ISTC)   systems support the development of sophisticated   interactive documents that include computing,   programming, visualization features. ISTC systems   can be put to especially good use in the context   of nonlinear systems modeling and optimization,   in both education and research. We demonstrate   global/local optimization capabilities of Maple   and Mathematica, including both built-in and   add-on functionality. We also highlight   engineering and scientific application perspectives.</br>
