<br>Title: Influential Research in Information Systems: A Social Network Analysis of Research in Digital Goods</br><br>Author: Sudip Bhattacharjee, Associate Professor, University of Connecticut, OPIM Department, School of Business, Storrs, CT, United States of America, Sudip.Bhattacharjee@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Harpreet Singh, James R. Marsden</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We identify over 130 research papers in two digital goods domains - software and music - published in peer-reviewed journals. We then create a social network based on a paper's listed references within the set of chosen papers. We identify influential papers in each domain, and provide a structured identification and classification of key papers and contributors. We also contrast network linkage density between the domains, and draw conclusions and suggestions for future research.</br>
