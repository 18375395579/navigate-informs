<br>Title: Categorising Spreadsheets: A Report on a Pilot Study</br><br>Author: Pat Cleary, Senior Lecturer, EuSpRIG (European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group), University of Wales Institute Cardiff, Cardiff School of Management, Colchester Avenue, Cardiff, CF23 9XR, United Kingdom, PMCleary@uwic.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): M Madahar</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A pilot study has been initiated to examine spreadsheets in use in an administration unit within the University of Wales Institute Cardiff (UWIC). Through this study we hope to develop a frame work for categorising spreadsheets by use, importance and risk. If successful, the framework could prove to be a valuable tool in the management of the risks associated with spreadsheet use. This paper will summarise initial results of the pilot study and discuss their value.</br>
