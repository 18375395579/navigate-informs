<br>Title: Learning to Learn</br><br>Author: Benjamin Van Roy, Stanford University, 273 Packard, Stanford, CA, United States of America, bvr@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We will discuss the importance of learning to learn, and how this is a distinctive element of reinforcement learning relative to other areas of statistical learning.  We will then survey some  relevant research and discuss recent work on an algorithm that efficiently learns to learn (and learns) in dynamic systems with arbitrarily large state spaces by combining optimistic exploration and value function generalization.</br>
