<br>Title: Predictive Analytics in Support of Operational Risk Management</br><br>Author: Artur Dubrawski, Auton Lab, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, NSH 3121, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, awd@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laurel Moyer, Bradley Mowry, Sharon Hamilton, Joe Smith, Kirsten Palmer, Timothy Stewart, Michael Baysek, John Ostlund, Michael Knight, Norman Sondheimer</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The key objective of operational risk management is to maintain required levels of availability of systems. Predictive analytics can help achieving that by enabling early detection and identification of emerging as well as previously known patterns in operations data, which may lead to unplanned downtimes or expediting. We illustrate the utility of selected data driven predictive analytics methods with real world examples taken from the area of maintenance and logistics of a fleet of aircraft.</br>
