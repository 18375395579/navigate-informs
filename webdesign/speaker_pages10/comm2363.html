<br>Title: First Principles of Service Science</br><br>Author: Victor W. Tang, Scientist, MIT, 55 Deerfield Lane South, Pleasantville, 10570, United States of America, victor.w.tang@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fugee Tsung, Ruoyi Zhou, Robin Qiu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a derived set of first principles for service. We argue the importance and necessity for first principles. For lack of a coherent corpus of first principles, the promise of service as a science has yet to be fulfilled. We begin with the question: What is a service? The literature reports a very wide range of diverse definitions for “service? We reason from this work of scholars and distill our own definition, which we will present at this session. We follow with the question: What is service science? We define “science?and identify its fundamental objective, which is understanding. We define “engineering?and discuss its fundamental objective, which is creating physical or intangible artifacts. Engineering science is defined as the domain specific sciences used in the engineering practice, e.g. chemistry for chemical engineering, classical mechanics for mechanical engineering. Service is an act of creation. It follows that service is engineering. Service engineering is analogous to electrical engineering, or aeronautical engineering. In the same manner that aeronautical engineers create airplanes using the science of aerodynamics, service professionals create solutions to clients?problems. Services produce bundles of physical and intangible artifacts. Whereas the practice of engineering is grounded on well articulated first principles of the physical sciences; to our knowledge, we do not find scholarly work that articulates first principles of service science. The service literature is still struggling with definitions and “paradigmatic variables.?We must conclude that the promise of service as a science has yet to be fulfilled. In contrast, the field of management science is grounded on the first principles of economics, behavioral psychology, decision theory, and the theory of the firm. Medicine is grounded on biology, anatomy, physiology, and the universally accepted first principles of ethics and humane treatment. Conspicuously absent for service is a coherent corpus of first principles that are universally accepted as axiomatic truths that have explanatory and predictive power. To address this gap, we derive a starter set of first principles for services and present a meta-roadmap for service science research capable of leading to a service theory. We close with a proposal on how scholars and practitioners can move forward from these first principles to accelerate the maturation of service into a service science and service theory.</br>
