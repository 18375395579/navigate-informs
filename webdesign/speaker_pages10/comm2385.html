<br>Title: A Simulation-based Optimization Framework for Pandemic Impact Mitigation</br><br>Author: Tapas K. Das, Professor, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, das@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alex Savachkin, Diana Prieto, Andres Uribe</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: At present, scalable mitigation strategies do not exist for pandemic outbreaks that could affect tens of millions of people in many geographically dispersed cities. We present a real-time simulation tool mimicking movements of each individual in large cities during many weeks of pandemic progress and discuss how to generate mitigation strategies at both national and local levels using a simulation based hierarchical stochastic optimization framework.</br>
