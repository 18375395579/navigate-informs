<br>Title: Building a Business Based on an OR Technology</br><br>Author: Irv Lustig, ILOG Direct Channel Director, ILOG, 25 Sylvan Way, Short Hills, NJ, 07078, United States of America, irv@ilog.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Twenty years ago, CPLEX went from being a linear programming solver developed by Bob Bixby to the core technology behind a small business.  That small business did 5.7 million dollars of sales in Fiscal Year 1997, and was sold for over 30 million dollars at the time.  Now, it is the key driver behind over 40 million dollars of annual optimization license revenue for ILOG.  This presentation will discuss how a business was built around an LP solver, and the challenges to make that business grow.</br>
