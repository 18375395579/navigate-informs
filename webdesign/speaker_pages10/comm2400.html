<br>Title: Integrated Production-Distribution Scheduling: Some Open Problems</br><br>Author: Zhi-Long Chen, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, ZChen@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In the last couple of years, we have seen a growing interest in integrated production-distribution scheduling models. The computational complexity of many models have been clarified in the recent literature. In this talk, we will present a number of  problems with unknown complexity.</br>
