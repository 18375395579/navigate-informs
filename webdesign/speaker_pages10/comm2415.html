<br>Title: Data Overload: V-22 Osprey's Foray into Big Data</br><br>Author: Joseph Schmidley, V-22 ALE IPT Lead, Department of the Navy, 47123 Buse Road, B2272 Rm 146, Patuxent River, MD, 20670, United States of America, joseph.schmidley@navy.mil</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: After 100,000 flight hours, the V-22 program has started to leverage mass amounts of data from this sensor-rich tiltrotor platform. The requirement to collect/process/analyze aircraft data, with an increase in operational tempo, while continuing to grow in fleet size, the V-22 program must take action to capitalize on all of its data.  We will review the V-22’s current challenges and the collaborative efforts through its transition from information technology to information capital.</br>
