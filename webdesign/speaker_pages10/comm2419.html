<br>Title: Planning the Bioterror Response Supply Chain: Learn and Live</br><br>Author: Margaret Brandeau, Professor, Stanford University, 407 Terman Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, brandeau@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Douglas Owens, Dena Bravata, David Hutton</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Responses to bioterrorism require rapid procurement and distribution of medical and pharmaceutical supplies, trained personnel, and information.  We describe how concepts learned from published evaluations of manufacturing and service supply chains, as well as lessons learned from responses to natural disasters, naturally occurring outbreaks, and the 2001 U.S. anthrax attacks, can be applied to design, evaluate, and improve the bioterrorism response supply chain.</br>
