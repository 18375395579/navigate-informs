<br>Title: Conferences as Venues for the Configuration of Emerging Organizational Fields: The Case of Cochlear Implants</br><br>Author: Raghu Garud, Penn State University, rgarud@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: I examine how conferences can be occasions for the configuration of emerging organizational fields by describing three that I attended during the development and commercialization of cochlear implants. These conferences served as venues for a variety of activities to unfold ranging from the exchange of information to the enactment of technological possibilities. A full appreciation of conferences as holistic events, I argue, offers us a particularly valuable entry point into gaining a deeper understanding of how new fields are assembled in real time.</br>
