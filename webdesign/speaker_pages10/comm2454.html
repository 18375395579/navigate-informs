<br>Title: Nanomanufacturing Opportunities: An Air Force Research Laboratory Perspective</br><br>Author: Capt. Joseph McDermott, U.S. Air Force, Joseph.McDermott@wpafb.af.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): Katie Thorp</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: After a brief overview of the current nanomaterial focus areas within the Air Force Research Laboratory this talk will highlight opportunities in aerospace for nanotechnology as well as provide examples of the potential of nano-structured materials to meet the necessary challenges.  Early successful nanomanufacturing projects to improve scale-up and decrease cost will be briefly discussed.</br>
