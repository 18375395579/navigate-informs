<br>Title: University Technology Transfer Efficiency Metrics</br><br>Author: Tim Anderson, Associate Professor, Portland State University, PO Box 751, Portland, OR, 97207, United States, tima@etm.pdx.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jisun Kim, Tugrul Daim</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Abstract: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used for evaluating the  efficiency of 51 universities over four years. An efficiency diagram  was developed to represent and explain the patterns of performance change for university technology transfer efficiency (UTTE) which provide more detail about how so-called efficient universities are different from each other and how each university can keep or improve its efficiency.</br>
