<br>Title: Models and Methods for Robust and Dynamic Decision Making in Mass Participation Event Planning</br><br>Author: Mehmet Basdere, MS, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, MehmetBasdere2016@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sanjay Mehrotra, Colleen Ross, Jennifer Chang, George Chiampas, Karen Smilowitz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present an overview of an on-going collaboration between the medical team of the Chicago Marathon and faculty from Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences. The goal is to optimize decision-making for mass participation events using operations research methodologies. As such, the research will lead to advances in medical preparedness and response for mass participation events and new developments in robust and dynamic logistics and resource allocation models.</br>
