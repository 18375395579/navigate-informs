<br>Title: Personal Information for a World as We Want it to Be, Part 1</br><br>Author: William Jones, Associate Research Professor, University of Washington, Suite 400 Roosevelt Commons, Seattle, WA, 98195-2840, United States of America, williamj@u.washington.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Imagine a car with an enormous rear-view mirror and only a tiny windshield. Not practical. Possibly dangerous. But do our tools promote an analogous imbalance of perspective with respect to our information and its management? The vision of an all-inclusive recording of a person's past experiences now seems attainable with few economic or technical barriers standing in the way.</br>
