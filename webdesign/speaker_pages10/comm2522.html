<br>Title: OR/MS for Public-Sector Decisionmaking with Limited Resources:   Values, Evidence and Methods</br><br>Author: Michael Johnson, Extern, Carnegie Mellon University, Center for Economic Development, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, United States, johnson2@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Public decisionmaking is a challenging enterprise: practitioners and researchers must balance concerns of politics, policy, appropriate methods and fiscal constraints. In this presentation I review applications of OR/MS methods to problems in location of community corrections centers, fire stations and affordable housing, as well as reconfiguration of public school buildings and programs. My primary finding is that both qualitative and quantitative analytical methods are useful in assisting system change, especially in fiscally-constrained and politically contentious environments. Also, I find that OR-like thinking can be just as useful as explicit models and methods.</br>
