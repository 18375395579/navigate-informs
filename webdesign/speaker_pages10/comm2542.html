<br>Title: Urban Area Crime Modeling: Spatiotemporal History, Opportunity, and Security Resource Allocation</br><br>Author: Daniel Salazar, University of Southern California, 3710 McClintock Ave, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-2902, United States of America, danielsalazaraponte@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Samrat Chatterjee</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a probabilistic graphical model based approach to estimate the risk of robbery around a university campus. Model components include location and time of past incidents, opportunity related to pedestrian density and environmental conditions -like weather and lighting- as well as mobile preventative security resources. Optimization models for allocation of mobile security measures to reduce robbery risk are also discussed.</br>
