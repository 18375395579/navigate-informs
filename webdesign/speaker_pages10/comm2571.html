<br>Title: Scenario-Based Examinations in a Core OR Course</br><br>Author: Andrew Armacost, Associate Professor of OR, US Air Force Academy, 2354 Fairchild Drive, Suite 6J100, USAFA, CO, 80840, United States, Andy.Armacost@usafa.af.mil</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In our core course exams, we have found that students often spend a large amount of time on trying to understand the written scenarios (which is imperative), and less time applying modeling techniques and interpreting solutions. We describe two approaches we've used to allow all three elements to occur.  Both approaches involve providing scenarios in advance in a manner that encourages students to understand the scenarios before the exam and to anticipate questions that might occur on the exam.</br>
