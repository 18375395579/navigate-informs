<br>Title: Incorporating NBA Schedule Imbalances in a Fantasy Basketball Draft</br><br>Author: Lori Houghtalen, Assistant Professor, Babson College, Math & Science Division, 316 Babson Hall, Babson Park, MA, 02457, United States of America, lhoughtalen@babson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Recck</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Many NBA fantasy leagues operate on a weekly schedule where rosters are fixed each week.  Since fantasy points are accrued according to player performance in real-life play, the success of a fantasy team in a given week is impacted by the number of games played by teams represented on the fantasy roster.   We investigate a fantasy drafting approach that incorporates NBA schedule imbalances, and compare the success of this strategy to strategies that do not take scheduling into account.</br>
