<br>Title: The Bombs Bursting in Air?:  Explosions Aboard Commercial Aircraft</br><br>Author: Arnie Barnett, abarnett@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The Transportation Security Administration has identified explosive devices as the greatest current threat to US aviation. In recent years, bombs have been smuggled onto airplanes within checked luggage, in carry-on bags, in cargo, and strapped to the bodies of suicidal terrorists. In 2004, simultaneous bombings in Russia caused the destruction of two passenger jets. We discuss some security measures now taken--and others not taken--aimed at preventing such horrors, and explore whether existing policies make sense from a cost-benefit perspective.</br>
