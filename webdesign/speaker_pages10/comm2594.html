<br>Title: Participatory Priority-Setting Processes with Robust Portfolio Modeling</br><br>Author: Ahti Salo, Professor, Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory, PO Box 1100, Otakaari 1 M, Espoo, 02015, Finland, ahti.salo@hut.fi</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The collaborative development of research priorities typically involves high uncertainties, multiple objectives and a large number of participants. We report case studies where internet-based decision aiding tools, Robust Portfolio Modelling and participatory workshops have served to inform the development of national priorities. We also discuss network-oriented portfolio decision analyses, with examples from an international consultation process involving over 400 participants from 8 countries.</br>
