<br>Title: Gaming Analysis System with Information Security: An Initiative Framework for Supply Chain Simulatio</br><br>Author: Yueting Chai, Prof., Tsinghua University, Room 608 Main Building, Tsinghua University, Beijing, be, 100084, China, chaiyt@tsinghua.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Linlin Cui</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Web-2.0 technology provides opportunities to the supply chain simulation method to develop its advantages of visualization and transparency as web services. Aiming at the problem of information insecurity during simulation modeling processes, a simulation based gaming analysis framework is proposed incorporating with the multi-agent modeling method. Platform architecture is described based on a survey of current supply chain simulation models and tools. Future work is discussed in the end.</br>
