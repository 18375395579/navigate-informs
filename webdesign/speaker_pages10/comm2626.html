<br>Title: A Crystal Box Process Used to Validate Dynamic Decision Networks:  How Agent-Based Simulations Help.</br><br>Author: Charles Sulewski, United States Military Academy, Thayer Hall, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, chuck.sulewski@us.army.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jerry Kobylski</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A new decision tool called Dynamic Decision Networks (DDNs) can help future battlefield leaders make good decisions given information overload. DDNs provide good approximations to Dynamic Programming for simple decisions. The Crystal Box Process invites other disciplines to examine the DDN. This presentation will show a DDN model that was first constructed by domain experts, and then how an agent-based simulation provided insight to simplify the DDN in support of the Future Combat Systems.</br>
