<br>Title: Computing in Operations Research using Julia</br><br>Author: Miles Lubin, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, mlubin@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Iain Dunning</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Julia, a new high-level programming language for scientific computing, claims to bridge the performance gap between languages such as Python and MATLAB and low-level languages such as C and C++. We will evaluate these claims in the context of algorithms and software fundamental to the field of operations research, including the simplex method and algebraic modeling. We provide extensive cross-language benchmarks and comparisons with state-of-the-art modeling packages such as AMPL and Pyomo.</br>
