<br>Title: Charles Bartlett McGuire: An Appreciation</br><br>Author: Roy Radner, Stern School of Business, New York University, rradner@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The research, writing, and teaching of Charles Bartlett McGuire (1926-2006) spanned a diverse set of topics in microeconomic theory and operations research. Although most widely known for his pioneering book (with M. Beckmann and C. Winsten), Studies in the Economics of Transportation (1956), he also worked on the prevention of accidental nuclear war, team theory, the economic value of information, leasing of federal land for coal exploration, decentralization of electricity grids, auctions for electric power plants, markets for ozone-depleting pollution permits, and general sorting theory. In this paper I shall describe some of this work, both published and unpublished.</br>
