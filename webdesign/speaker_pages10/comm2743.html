<br>Title: Decision Making in a World with Large Datasets</br><br>Author: Ali Abbas, Associate Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61822, United States of America, aliabbas@illinois.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: As more data is becoming available through the internet and other resources, and as computational efficiency is becoming ever increasing, there is a need to make several distinctions and algorithms that can help in decision making with large datasets. There is also a need to filter out arbitrary methods. I discuss several discussions relating data to information to decision making.</br>
