<br>Title: Using Spreadsheet Models to Play Games in the Classroom</br><br>Author: Sherry Weaver, Instructor, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N4, Canada, sweaver@ucalgary.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: As our classrooms have become more interactive, we have brought in many interesting 'games' and simulations to help the students gain some hands-on insights into many concepts in OR/OM.  Excel-based software to teach inventory management, central limit theorem, SPC, facility layout and yield management will be demonstrated.  Each has been developed using Excel with VBA and the author will discuss the benefits (and ease!) of bringing spreadsheets as educational software into the classroom.</br>
