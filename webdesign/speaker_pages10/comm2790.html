<br>Title: Great Unsolved Problems in Inventory Theory</br><br>Author: Paul H. Zipkin, Professor, Fuqua School of Business, Box 90120, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708-0120, United States, paul.zipkin@duke.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Inventory theory has made great strides in the last half century, but many problems remain unsolved, problems of immense practical and scientific significance. We still lack a good understanding of single-item systems with leadtimes and extra complicating factors, such as lost sales and random yields. As for multi-item systems, we can deal with a few special structures, such as series systems, but others remain beyond our reach.  We are just starting to study supply chains with several actors.</br>
