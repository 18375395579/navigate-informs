<br>Title: A Player Selection Heuristic for a Sports League Draft</br><br>Author: Michael Fry, Assistant Professor, University of Cincinnati, 532 Lindner Hall, QAOM Department, Cincinnati, OH, 45221-0130, United States, mike.fry@uc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Ohlmann, Andy Lundberg</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We model the decision-making process of a sports franchise during a player selection draft. Our dynamic programming-based model considers both the needs of a particular team as well as the overall abilities of the players available to be drafted. Our model can be solved in real time during a draft using a spreadsheet-based decision support system. We provide an example of our strategy applied to a fantasy football draft and compare our proposed solution strategy to several competing heuristics.</br>
