<br>Title: Managing Technical and Business Risk in Software Development</br><br>Author: Clay Williams, Manager, Governance Science Research, IBM, IBM Research, Hawthorne, NY, 10532, United States of America, clayw@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peri Tarr</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Software has gone from running back office applications to being central for the operation of businesses.  The risk associated with developing software has not decreased as rapidly as the pervasiveness of software, meaning that the risk to the business has actually increased.  We present an overview of the technical factors that contribute to software risk, and show how they map to business risk.  We also discuss strategies and tools for understanding and mitigating risk in software development.</br>
