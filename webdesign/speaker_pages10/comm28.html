<br>Title: The DeMOOCratization of Online Education: An Empirical Study of the Efficacy of Online Courses</br><br>Author: Aravinda Garimella, PhD Student, University of Washington, 400 NE 45th Street, Seattle, Wa, 98105, United States of America, aravinda.garimella@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yong Tan, Ming Fan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are changing the landscape of education as we know it. We study the implications of the large scale and heterogeneity of the student population in MOOCs on learning dynamics and empirically investigate the efficacy of MOOCs as a pedagogical tool. We study student behavior over time and inquire whether the social nature of these platforms turn them into symbiotic platforms where students learn not only from the instructor, but also from each other.</br>
