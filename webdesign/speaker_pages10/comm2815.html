<br>Title: Avoiding Disaster Readiness Disasters</br><br>Author: Robin Dillon, Assistant Professor, Georgetown University, 418 Old North, McDonough School of Business, Washington, DC, 20057, United States, rld9@georgetown.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: After Hurricane Katrina, people are questioning the readiness decisions that were made.  Poor decisions appear to have been made at every level, and tracing the roots of these poor decisions often leads to a discussion of how precursor events shape perceptions.  This research examines how past events and currently available probability information are interpreted and examines the importance of integrating decision theory with disaster readiness to improve decision making.</br>
