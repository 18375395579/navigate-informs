<br>Title: Data-driven Analysis of Spatiotemporal Human Behavior</br><br>Author: Rajiv Maheswaran, Research Assistant Professor, University of Southern California, 4676 Admiralty Way #1001, Marina Del Rey, CA, United States of America, maheswar@isi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yu-Han Chang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In security, energy, transportation, communication and even sports, we've seen an expanding ability to gather fine-grained data about societies of agents engaging in spatial and temporal behavior. We present computational tools and techniques in combination with machine learning and statistical approaches to learn underlying behavior patterns. These patterns can be leveraged to more deeply understand the domain and create strategies to improve policy making in these arenas.</br>
