<br>Title: Developing Capabilities-Based Battle Command Training Centers for the Future Force</br><br>Author: Simon Goerger, Assistant Professor & ORCEN Director, Department of Systems Engineering, Building 752 (Mahan Hall), United States Military Academy, West Point, NY, 10996, United States, Simon.Goerger@usma.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gregory Boylan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Training the Army’s future digital force has precipitated the need to assess the ability of current training facilities to meet the needs of the transforming force. Of interest are the Battle Command Training Centers (BCTCs) and their abilities to support the Army’s training needs for this future force. This presentation addresses the systems engineering process used to determine essential requirements and the resulting model designed to validate the capabilities of prototype BCTC facilities.</br>
