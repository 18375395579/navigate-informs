<br>Title: An Operations Research Game on the iOS Platform</br><br>Author: Meltem Ozmadenci, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Mohler Laboratory, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, meltemozmadenci@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence V. Snyder</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We have built an iPad application which demonstrates classical OR problems, explored in the context of a restaurant business game. The game has several sections modeling different problem types such as Facility Location and Traveling Salesman. The user faces versions of these problems in increasing difficulty, unlocking successive levels by finding optimal solutions. In this talk, we will demonstrate the app and discuss how it can be used to teach OR concepts.</br>
