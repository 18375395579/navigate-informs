<br>Title: Risk Analysis of Internet Interconnection Architecture</br><br>Author: Dohoon Kim, Professor, Kyung Hee University, School of Business, Hoegi-dong 1, Dongdaemoon-gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea, Republic of, dyohaan@khu.ac.kr</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies a way to increase stability and reliability of the Internet interconnection network. First, we summarize various interconnection options. Then, conducted is a series of experiments to identify the weakest point of the current Internet interconnection system. Based on our simulation results, we present not only the guidelines for a robust interconnection architecture, but also a risk analysis framework to evaluate pros and cons of interconnection alternatives.</br>
