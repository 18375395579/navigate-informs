<br>Title: Aviation and Environment: Principle Effects and Uncertainties</br><br>Author: Terry Thompson, Director, Strategic Development, Metron Aviation, 45300 Catalina Court, Suite 101, Dulles, VA, 20166, United States of America, thompson@metronaviation.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This talk establishes background and context for discussions of aviation and associated environmental impacts.  Main topics are the generation of greenhouse gases, possible impacts associated with different phases of aircraft operation, and the interplay between climate-related effects, local air quality, and noise effects.  Key uncertainties in scientific understanding and connections with research questions in multi-objective optimization are also identified.</br>
