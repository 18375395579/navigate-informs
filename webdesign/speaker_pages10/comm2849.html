<br>Title: Alan S. Manne: Energy Modeling Pioneer</br><br>Author: John P. Weyant, Professor, Department of Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Terman Engineering B, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, weyant@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The late 1960s and early 1970s marked the genesis of modern energy modeling. New problems were addressed, new data was collected, new algorithms were implemented, and new insights were developed. In all these areas Alan S. Manne was a trail blazer. This talk highlights Alan's contributions using early energy market analyses and energy technology assessments as examples.</br>
