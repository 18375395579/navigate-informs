<br>Title: Innovation Management Processes and Tools:  A Case Study Approach from the Utility Industry</br><br>Author: Jisun Kim, Bonneville Power Administration, 905 NE 11th Ave., Portland, OR, United States of America, jxkim@bpa.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Judith Estep</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: To manage innovation effectively a systematic process is required. Often these processes are independent of the industry and include identifying strategies, developing strategic portfolios, managing the projects, and finally moving from research and development (R&D) into application. A case study approach is used to describe an example of institutionalizing R&D management in the utility industry. Finally, lessons learned are captured to help researchers avoid similar barriers.</br>
