<br>Title: Panel Discussion: Integrating Demand and Network Models</br><br>Author: </br><br>Coauthor(s): </br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In research and practice, there have been many advances on both the travel demand modeling (e.g., activity-based models) and travel supply modeling (e.g., traffic microsimulation and dynamic traffic assignment). However, there has been less attention to the integration of these advanced models. Current integration techniques (e.g., loose coupling of these models to transfer data from one to the other) do not take advantage of the added behavioral data available in each model, nor do they achieve consistency among parameters that are used in both demand and supply models. This panel session brings together top researchers with experience in both demand- and supply-side modeling to discuss the status of the field, critical issues, innovative research, and future directions.</br>
