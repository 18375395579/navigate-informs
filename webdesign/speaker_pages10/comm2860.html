<br>Title: Large Airtankers and Suppression:  Comparing Models and Reality</br><br>Author: Matthew Thompson, Research Forester, US Forest Service, PO Box 7669, Missoula, MT, 59807, United States of America, mpthompson02@fs.fed.us</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Large airtankers are prized for their ability to quickly travel to fire starts and to facilitate containment during initial attack operations.  Subsequently optimization models for supporting large airtanker fleet composition and location-allocation decisions are premised on the primary use of large airtankers being for initial attack.  But is that how large airtankers are actually used?  This presentation will review recently uncovered trends in large airtanker use in the U.S., explore implications, and discuss future opportunities for improving efficiencies.</br>
