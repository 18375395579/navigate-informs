Ortiz, Flor Sánchez, Mauricio Mejía</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: To make a better use of its resources and to leverage negotiation with the Defense Ministry and the Colombian Planning Department, the Colombian Navy (ARC, for its acronym in Spanish) has developed a Web-based decision support system to select and schedule a bank of projects. Many of these projects (e.g., acquisition of a new coast guard patrol boat) have a direct impact on manpower planning. Thus, a second decision support tool allows the ARC to estimate costs and properly plan its workforce.</br>
