<br>Title: Integrating MS/OR Modeling into an ERP Course</br><br>Author: Dale Flowers, Associate Professor, Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, dale.flowers@case.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, I describe a graduate course in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems that utilizes a set of MS/OR case studies, where all the cases are from the same company. The cases range from detailed and operational issues such as the BOM explosion to more strategic issues such as hierarchical production planning and distribution network design. They reveal the integration between different modules of an ERP system, and are facilitated via the use of the STORM software package.</br>
