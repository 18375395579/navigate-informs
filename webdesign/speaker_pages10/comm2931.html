<br>Title: Computational Modeling of Brain Activities in a Perceptual-motor Task</br><br>Author: Changxu (Sean) Wu, Assistant Professor, SUNY, Buffalo, 438 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, changxu@buffalo.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we describe how to use a queueing network approach and other computational methods to model brain activities when human subjects are performing a perceptual-motor task. The extension of our modeling approach in quantifying human performance and mental workload is also discussed.</br>
