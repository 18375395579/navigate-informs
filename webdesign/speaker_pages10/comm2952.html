<br>Title: Constructing Organisational Preferences: Within-Criterion Weighting in Multi-Criteria Portfolio</br><br>Author: Alec Morton, A.Morton@lse.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Phillips</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Decision Analysis often helps people discuss what precisely constitutes value for their organisation.  Decision Conferencing in particular uses multiple workshops with multiple areas of the organization to develop a value model. Locally assessed valuations may require “within-criterion weights?to arrive at a global value scale.  We shall interpret these weights, and explore their ability to reduce error, and the appropriateness of different ways of structuring an intervention which uses them.</br>
