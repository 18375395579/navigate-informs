<br>Title: Heuristics for Disaster Response Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Erica Gralla, MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Rm. 37-344a, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, egralla@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Charles Fine</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Disaster response logistics is challenging because of the lack of information after a disaster, and the confusion of multiple ‘on the ground?decision makers. This paper suggests the notion of heuristics to enable fast decisions with little information, and to introduce structure in the management of supply chains, yet maintain the flexibility of decentralized decision making. Heuristics are identified within current practice, and evaluated for their effect on disaster response logistics.</br>
