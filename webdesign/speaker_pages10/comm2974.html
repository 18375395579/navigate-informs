<br>Title: Multi-agent Scheduling Problems  > Scheduling Problems</br><br>Author: Alessandro Agnetis, Professor, Universit?di Siena, Dipartimento Ingegneria Informazione, via Roma 56, Siena, 53034, Italy, agnetis@dii.unisi.it</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In Multi-Agent Scheduling problems, a number of distinct agents, each owning a subset of all jobs, share common processing resources. The analysis in this case focuses on finding efficient and, possibly, fair solutions. After presenting some motivation, we review basic issues, illustrate the main complexity results, discuss related problems and point out future research needs.</br>
