<br>Title: Departure Flow Management Concept and Algorithms Overview</br><br>Author: Jason Pepper, Senior Software Engineer, Metron Aviation, Inc., 131 Elden St, Suite 200, Herndon, VA, 20170, United States of America, pepper@metronaviation.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ted Carniol</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Departure Flow Management (DFM) system automates the coordination of departures from multiple airports into shared and congested National Airspace System (NAS) resources via improved decision support capabilities and web-based communications.  DFM increases situational awareness and moves decision making away from a centralized authority, to parties with more need for control. This presentation will compare current operations to the operations under DFM, and will discuss the DFM algorithms.</br>
