<br>Title: Extending an Interior-Point Algorithm with Higher Order Corrections to Semidefinite Programming</br><br>Author: Zhifeng Li, Financial Engineer, Fannie Mae, 3900 Wisconsin Avenue, Washington, DC, 20016, United States, zack_z_li@fanniemae.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sanjay Mehrotra</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We extend a primal-dual infeasible interior-point algorithm with higher order corrections for linear programming (LP) to Semidefinite Programming (SDP). The resulted algorithm has the capbility to combine higher order corrections generated by different strategies. The search direction of the algorithm can be obtained by solving a small SDP program. We give convergence conditions for the algorithm.</br>
