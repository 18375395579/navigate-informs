<br>Title: A Stochastic Programming Approach for Integrated Nurse Staffing and Assignment</br><br>Author: Prattana Punnakitikashem, Ph.D Candidate, The University of Texas at Arlington, Dept. of Industrial Engineering, Campus Box 19017, Arlington, TX, 76019-0017, United States, prattana_p@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Rosenberger, Deborah Behan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop a new stochastic programming model that integrates short-term nurse staffing and nurse-to-patient assignment under patient care uncertainty with an objective to minimize excess workload on nurses. Three solution approaches are presented to solve the problem, which are Benders?decomposition, Benders?decomposition with Lagrangian relaxation, and nested decomposition. Computational results are provided based upon real data from the Baylor Regional Medical Center Grapevine, Texas.</br>
