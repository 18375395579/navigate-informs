<br>Title: Multi-stage Stochastic Decomposition</br><br>Author: Zhihong Zhou, The University of Arizona, 2519 Indianola Ave. Apt. A, Columbus, OH, United States, zhzhou@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Suvrajeet Sen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic decomposition (SD) has been very successful at solving  two-stage stochastic programming problems.  In this talk, we generalize the ideas underlying SD to multi-stage SLP.  It turns out that Rockafellar's primal-dual stochastic programming framework for SP plays a critical role in this algorithm.</br>
