<br>Title: Cost-bounded Binary Decision Diagrams for Integer Programming</br><br>Author: John Hooker, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, john@hooker.tepper.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tarik Hadzic</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) have seen widespread application in logic circuit design and product configuration.  We recently applied them to solving linear and nonlinear integer programming problems.  A BDD can provide a surprisingly compact representation of the feasible set and can thus provide rapid, in-depth postoptimality analysis if it is not too large.  We show how the BDD can be substantially reduced in size, while retaining its usefulness, if it represents near-optimal solutions.</br>
