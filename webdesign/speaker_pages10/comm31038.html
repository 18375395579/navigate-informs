<br>Title: A Branch-and-bound Approach for Maximum Quasi-cliques</br><br>Author: Zhuqi Miao, PhD Student, Oklahoma State University, 808 N. Monroe, APT. 32, Stillwater, United States of America, ZHUQI.MIAO@OKSTATE.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Foad Mahdavi Pajouh, Baski Balasundaram</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Detecting quasi-cliques is an important tool for detecting dense clusters in graphs. Quasi-clique detection has been accomplished using heuristic approaches in various applications of graph-based data mining. However, exact approaches for the problem are limited to two mixed integer programming formulations that were proposed recently. This article presents a new combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for the maximum quasi-clique problem and studies its performance on benchmark instances.</br>
