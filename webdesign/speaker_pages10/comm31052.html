<br>Title: LOQO, an Interior-point Code for Nonconvex Nonlinear Programming</br><br>Author: Hande Y. Benson, Assistant Professor, Drexel University, Dep. of Decision Sciences, 3141 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104-2875, United States, benson@drexel.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Vanderbei, David Shanno</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We will present the latest advances in LOQO, a general-purpose code that implements an interior-point method for solving nonconvex nonlinear programming problems. Of particular note will be the primal-dual penalty approach for solving and warmstarting nonlinear programming problems, including its application to mixed-integer nonlinear programming.</br>
