<br>Title: Primal-dual First-order Method for Cone Programming</br><br>Author: Guanghui Lan, School of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States, glan@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhaosong Lu, Renato Monteiro</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we consider the general cone programming problem, and propose primal-dual convex (smooth and/or nonsmooth) minimization reformulations for it. We then discuss first-order methods suitable for solving these reformulations, namely, Nesterov's optimal method, Nesterov's smooth approximation scheme, and Nemirovski's prox-method, and propose a variant of Nesterov's optimal method which has outperformed the latter one in our computational experiments.  We also derive iteration-complexity bounds for these first-order methods applied to the proposed primal-dual reformulations of the cone programming problem. The performance of these methods is then compared using a set of randomly generated linear programming and semidefinite programming (SDP) instances.</br>
