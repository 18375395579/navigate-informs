<br>Title: The De-blurring of Medical Images with Image Segmentation</br><br>Author: Dorit Hochbaum, University of California Berkeley, hochbaum@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: An image is segmented by modifying the pixels' colors while minimizing  the penalty of modification and a penalty associated with adjacent  pixels having different colors.  A very efficient and best possible  polynomial algorithm of Hochbaum, based on parametric cut procedure,  removes blur from medical images and improves significantly their quality.</br>
