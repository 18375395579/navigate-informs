<br>Title: Robust Weight Optimization of Return and Reliability in Multi-Portfolio Optimization</br><br>Author: Siqian Shen, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 2793 IOE, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, siqian@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhihao Chen, Miguel A. Lejeune</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Management of risk through multiple chance constraints requires proper weighing of cost against virtual reward gained from reliability satisfaction. We derive robust solutions given uncertain weights (decision preferences) of return and reliability in a multi-portfolio optimization problem with joint/multiple chance constraints. We bound feasible weights within a box and use MIP techniques. Both computational and managerial results are provided.</br>
