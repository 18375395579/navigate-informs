<br>Title: On the Size of the Enumeration Tree in Integer Programming Reformulation Techniques</br><br>Author: Gabor Pataki, UNC-Chapel Hill, Hanes Building, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, pataki@email.unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Tural</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We give an upper bound in the size of the enumeration tree in Integer Programming reformulation techniques. As a corollary we show that for almost all IPs, where the coefficients are drawn from from a sufficiently large interval, the size of the enumeration tree for ordinary (i.e. branching on unit variables) branch-and-bound is at most 1.</br>
