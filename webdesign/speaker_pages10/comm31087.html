<br>Title: Extremal-volume Ellipsoids and Their Applications, Especially in Statistics</br><br>Author: Osman Guler, Professor, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD, 21250, United States of America, guler@math.umbc.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss geometric problems, e.g. extremal-volume ellipsoids and some of their applications, in data mining, control theory, statistics, and functional analysis.  We use semi-infinite duality to obtain new results as well improving and unifying some known results.  May other geometric problems can be treated with our approach; we will mention several of these. We also consider symmetry properties of our problems, with a view towards their practical and theoretical aspects.</br>
