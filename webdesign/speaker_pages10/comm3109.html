<br>Title: Polyhedral Results for Unsplittable Flow Problems</br><br>Author: Jean-Philippe Richard, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, richard@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): I. Ece Icyuz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a single-node network where a balance equation is imposed on incoming and outgoing arcs. We also require that each nonzero incoming flow be paired with a single outgoing flow of same value, and vice-versa. This model is a relaxation of practical railroads problems where flow can be split at some nodes but not at others. We propose a polynomial extended formulation and describe families of facet-defining inequalities in the original space of variables. We present computational results.</br>
