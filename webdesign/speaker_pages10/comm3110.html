<br>Title: Sufficiency of Cut-generating Functions</br><br>Author: Sercan Yildiz, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, syildiz@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gerard Cornuejols, Laurence Wolsey</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Cut-generating functions have their origin in the work of Gomory and Johnson from the 1970's and have received renewed attention in recent years. We settle an open problem and show that cut-generating functions are able to generate all possible cuts with a positive right-hand side under a technical sufficient condition.</br>
