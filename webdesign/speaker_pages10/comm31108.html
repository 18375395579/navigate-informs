<br>Title: RLT-POS: Reformulation-Linearization Technique-based Optimization Software for Polynomial Programs</br><br>Author: Evrim Dalkiran, Assistant Professor, Wayne State University, 4815 4th St., Manuf. Eng. Bldg. #2173, Detroit, MI, 48202, United States of America, evrimd@wayne.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hanif D. Sherali</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a Reformulation-Linearization Technique-based open-source optimization software for solving polynomial programs (RLT-POS). We present algorithms that form the backbone of RLT-POS, including constraint filtering techniques, reduced RLT representations, semidefinite cuts, and bound-grid-factor constraints. We present computational results to demonstrate the improvement over standard RLT, and compare the performances of the software packages BARON, SparsePOP, and Couenne with RLT-POS.</br>
