<br>Title: Computing Stable Farsighted Outcomes in Coalitional Games</br><br>Author: Mahesh Nagarajan, Assistant Professor, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, Mahesh.Nagarajan@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We provide the first set of results on the computational complexity of computing stable outcomes in dynamic coalitional games, namely the LCS and EPCF. We present a set of sufficient conditions that ensure that computing the LCS is NP hard. We then propose algorithms that approximately compute the LCS in an asymptotic sense. We discuss implications to computation of the EPCF and applications to supply chain games.</br>
