<br>Title: Building Solutions for 2-Stage and Multi-Stage Stochastic Linear Programs Using Xpress-MP</br><br>Author: Nitin Verma, Dash Optimization, 560 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, United States, nitin.verma@dashoptimization.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we demonstrate how one could use the modeling, programming, optimization, and visualization tools available in Xpress-MP to build solutions for stochastic problems. Specifically, we will show how to easily build comprehensive solutions -- for both analyses and deployment purposes -- in a relatively short frame of time using Xpress- SP together with Xpress-IVE, and XAD.</br>
