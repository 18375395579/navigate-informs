<br>Title: Computational Effectiveness of Split Cuts for Second-order Conic Programming</br><br>Author: Sina Modaresi, University of Pittsburgh, 3700 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, United States of America, sim23@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Kilinc, Juan Pablo Vielma</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Split cuts are one of the most effective cuts for linear MIPs and they are equivalent to MIR cuts. We show that this equivalency does not hold for second-order conic MIPs by giving examples where split cuts strictly dominate conic MIR cuts proposed by Atamturk et al.. However, split cuts have to be added as nonlinear inequalities, while conic MIR cuts can be added as linear inequalities to the extended formulation. We compare the trade-off between the speed and the strength of these cuts.</br>
