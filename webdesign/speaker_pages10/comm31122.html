<br>Title: Estimating Solution Time of Branch-and-bound Algorithm</br><br>Author: Osman Ozaltin, Doctoral student, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Industrial Engineering, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States, oyo1@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brady Hunsaker, Ted Ralphs</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider methods for evaluating the progress of B&B algorithms. One main goal is to provide users with more useful information on the progress of the algorithm and the other is to develop a method to predict the total solution time.   A novel progress measure is computed and total solution time predictions are calculated based on that measure. Three open-source solvers, COIN/Cbc, Symphony, and Glpk are used to study B&B tree development for a number of different test problems.</br>
