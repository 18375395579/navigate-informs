<br>Title: Geometric Programming for Communication Systems</br><br>Author: Mung Chiang, Assistant Professor, Princeton University, B328 Engineering Quad, Olden Street, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, chiangm@princeton.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This talk overviews the recent results on how geometric programming provides a powerful tool and a common language to a surprisingly wide range of problems in communication systems, from duality in information theory and performance maximization in queuing theory to wireless network power control and Internet congestion control. It also illustrates how these problems motivate further invesetigation in success convex approximation by GP and distributed algorithms for GP.</br>
