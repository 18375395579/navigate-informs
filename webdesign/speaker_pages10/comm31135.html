<br>Title: S-monotone Pivot Rules for Criss-cross Algorithm</br><br>Author: Tibor Illes, tibor.illes@strath.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Linear complementarity problems (LCP) are usually NP-hard problems.   Using the concept of EP-theorem and the LCP duality theorem, we were able to generalize criss-cross algorithm, using a new class of pivot rules ?called s-monotone pivot rules ?for LCP problems with arbitrary matrices. The well known pivot rules like minimal index rule, LIFO and MOSV belongs to the class of s-monotone pivot rules.</br>
