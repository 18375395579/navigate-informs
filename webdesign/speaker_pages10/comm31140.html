<br>Title: Dual Based Heuristics for the Connected Facility Location Problem</br><br>Author: Gisela Bardossy, University of Maryland, 4342 Van Munching Hall, Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, mbardoss@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Raghavan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Connected Facility Location Problem is an NP-complete problem that arises in the design of telecommunication networks where open facilities need to communicate with each other. We propose dual based heuristics that combine dual-ascent and local improvements that together yield lower and upper bounds to the optimal solution. We discuss a wide range of computational experiments, which indicate that our heuristic is a very effective procedure that finds high quality solutions very rapidly.</br>
