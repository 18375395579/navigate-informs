<br>Title: Parallel Approximation and Integer Programming Reformulation</br><br>Author: Gabor Pataki, UNC-Chapel Hill, Hanes Building, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, pataki@email.unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Tural</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We prove that in a low density knapsack problem branching on a vector which is near parallel to the constraint vector gives a short proof of infeasibility for almost all right hand sides. As a corollary we prove that in a reformulation using basis reduction, branching on the last variable achieves the same result.</br>
