<br>Title: A PTAS for Minimizing the Product of Two Non-negative Linear Costs</br><br>Author: Vineet Goyal, Tepper School of Business, CMU, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, vgoyal@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): R. Ravi, Latife Genc Kaya</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a quadratic programming (QP) problem where the objective is to minimize the product of two non-negative linear cost functions over a given polytope. We present a PTAS by reformulating the QP as a parameterized LP and rounding the optimal solution. Our algorithm returns an extreme point solution and thus applies directly to combinatorial 0-1 problems for which the convex hull of feasible integer solutions or its dominant is known such as spanning tree, shortest path and min-cut.</br>
