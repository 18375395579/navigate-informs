<br>Title: Local Search for the Open-pit-mine Scheduling Problem</br><br>Author: Thomas Prevost, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Louvain, Belgium, prevost.thomas@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marcos Goycoolea, Eduardo Moreno, Jorge Amaya</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Directly solving real-sized open-pit-mine scheduling problems with an integer programming solver is not possible due the huge number of variables.  We present a local search algorithm, which, starting from simple heuristic solutions, computes better ones by optimizing over  randomly selected small sections of the mine. This method is not limited by mine size, and adapts well to parallel architectures. Computational results are presented.</br>
