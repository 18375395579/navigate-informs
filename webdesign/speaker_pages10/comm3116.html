<br>Title: Scenario Clustering in a Progressive Hedging-based Meta-heuristic for Stochastic Network Design</br><br>Author: Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Professor, School of Management & CIRRELT, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, PW, Canada, TeodorGabriel.Crainic@cirrelt.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mike Hewitt, Walter Rei</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Progressive hedging offers a framework for developing best-in-breed meta-heuristics for solving scenario-based integer programs. Traditional implementations repeatedly solve single-scenario subproblems. We seek to understand whether higher quality solutions can be found in less time by solving subproblems that are comprised of multiple scenarios. We develop systematic strategies for choosing subproblems and evaluate them with an extensive computational study.</br>
