<br>Title: Why Should You Apply Pseudo-boolean Optimization?</br><br>Author: Gabriel Tavares, Consultant, Dash Optimization Inc, 560 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632, United States, gabriel.tavares@dashoptimization.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The peculiar relation between Professor Peter Hammer and his students will be outlined and illustrated.    Peter's research and his teaching methods were determinant to efficiently solve some difficult optimization problems.  I will present two types of problems (1-dimensional Ising chains and maximum independent sets of planar Delaunay graphs) that are typically solved in minutes using Hammer's techniques, but which cannot be solved on a time life by using state-of-the-art solvers.</br>
