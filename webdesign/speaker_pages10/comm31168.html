<br>Title: A New Class of Polynomial Interior-point Algorithms for  P*(\kappa)- linear Complementary Problems</br><br>Author: Goran Lesaja, Associate Professor, Georgia Southern University, Department of Mathematical Sciences, P.O. Box 8093, Statesboro, GA, 30458, United States of America, goran@GeorgiaSouthern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kees Roos, Yanqin Bai</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a new class of short- and long-step polynomial interior-point algorithms for P*(\kappa)- Linear Complementarity Problems based on a new class of parametric kernel functions. This class is fairly general and includes the classical logarithmic function, the prototype self-regular function, and non-self-regular kernel functions as special cases. The iteration bounds obtained in this paper are very favorable and they match the best known existing iteration bounds.</br>
