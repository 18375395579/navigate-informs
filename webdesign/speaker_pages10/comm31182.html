<br>Title: The Fortified Weiszfeld Algorithm for Solving the Weber Problem</br><br>Author: Zvi Drezner, Professor, California State University, Dept. of ISDS, Fullerton, CA, 92834, United States of America, zdrezner@FULLERTON.EDU</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: An improved Weiszfeld algorithm, termed the fortified Weiszfeld algorithm, for the solution of the single facility Weber problem with Euclidean distances is proposed. The new approach is based on a parabolic approximation of the objective function and testing demand points for optimality. Computational experiments show the superiority of the fortified approach over the original Weiszfeld algorithm.</br>
