<br>Title: Math Programming Approaches to the Art Gallery Problem: Formulations, Heuristics, and Results</br><br>Author: Amir Kalantari, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, PO.BOX 784, Milwaukee, United States of America, kalanta2@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Petering, Hamid Seifoddini</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The art gallery problem is a classic mathematical problem that has been investigated from many perspectives. Many algorithms have been developed to solve different variations of the problem. Most of these algorithms identify a sufficient number of guards that can cover the entire area. We develop an integer programming model that is able to find the maximum coverage area for a given number of guards. Unlike other algorithms, our model is versatile and can accommodate many different assumptions.</br>
