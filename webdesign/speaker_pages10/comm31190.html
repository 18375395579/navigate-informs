<br>Title: On Some Generalizations of Split Cuts</br><br>Author: Diego Alejandro Moran Ramirez, Georgia Institute of Technology, 225 North Ave NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, dmoran@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sanjeeb Dash, Oktay Gunluk</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Split cuts form a well-known class of valid inequalities for mixed-integer programming problems (MIP). Cook et al. (1990) showed that the  split closure of a rational polyhedron P is again a polyhedron.  In this paper, we extend this result from a single rational polyhedron to the union of a finite number of rational polyhedra. We also show how this result can be used to prove that some generalizations of split cuts, namely cross cuts, also yield closures that are rational polyhedra.</br>
