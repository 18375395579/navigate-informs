<br>Title: Evaluating Alternative Formulations for Open-pit Mine Block Sequencing</br><br>Author: Thomas Vossen, University of Colorado at Boulder, 995 Regent Dr, Boulder, CO, United States of America, vossen@colorado.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jose Ramirez</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The objective of open pit mine block sequencing is to determine a feasible extraction schedule from an open pit mine that maximizes profits over a given planning period. We propose and evaluate alternative formulations for this well-known problem that are derived from a non-linear programming formulation, and discuss preprocessing strategies that can significantly reduce the size of the resulting problems. Experimental results show the potential of our approach.</br>
