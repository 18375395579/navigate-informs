<br>Title: The Structure of Reduced bases for Kernel Lattices</br><br>Author: Karen Aardal, Delft University of Technology, Mekelweg 4, Delft, 2628 CD, Netherlands, K.I.Aardal@tudelft.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Frederik von Heymann, Andrea Lodi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the structure of reduced bases for lattices consisting of all integer vectors belonging to the null space of a positive integer vector. We observe that when the length is measured as the Euclidean distance, as in the standard implementation of the LLL algorithm, then the reduced basis has an Identity matrix as a submatrix. We provide a theoretical analysis, implications, and computational illustrations.</br>
