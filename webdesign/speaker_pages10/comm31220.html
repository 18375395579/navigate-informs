<br>Title: An Integer Stochastic Programming Problem with Linear Fractional Objective Function</br><br>Author: Alexandre Belloni, Duke University, The Fuqua School of Business, Durham, NC, United States, belloni@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this work we address an integer stochastic programming   problem whose objective function is the expectation of the sum of linear fractional functions. The problem is motivated by real applications. The approach is to use Lagrangian Relaxation to decompose the problem by scenarios which can be solved efficiently. Statistical techniques are used to provide guidance on the necessary number of scenarios. In preliminary computational experiments reliable bounds on the duality gap were obtained.</br>
