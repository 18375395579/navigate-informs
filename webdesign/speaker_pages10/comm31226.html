<br>Title: Portfolio Optimization using Stochastic Semi-definite Programming</br><br>Author: Sanjay Mehrotra, Northwestern University, IEMS Department, MEAS, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, mehrotra@iems.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gang Li</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a two stage stochastic semi-definite programming formulation of the portfolio optimization problem.  Using a GARCH model for return and co-variance scenario generation we present numerical results using a interior decomposition algorithm for this model.  The performance of the portfolio thus obtained is compared with portfolios from alternative models of portfolio risk using standard data sets.</br>
