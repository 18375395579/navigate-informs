<br>Title: Tutorial:  Building a Stochastic Simulation from Scratch</br><br>Author: H. Ric Blacksten, Senior Analyst, ANSER/Homeland Security Institute, 2900 S. Quincy St., Suite 800, Arlington, VA, 22206, United States of America, Harry.Blacksten@hsi.dhs.gov</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We demonstrate the basics of constructing a simple stochastic simulation from scratch, using a two-player duel as the illustrative problem.  From scratch means without special-purpose simulation add-ins or template simulations.   We show how to construct a real time simulation, sampling from Bernoulli, Poisson,  Gaussian and general piecewise-linear user-input distributions.  We show that, for some problems, simpler expected value models give incorrect results.</br>
