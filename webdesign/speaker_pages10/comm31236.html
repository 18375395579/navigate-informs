<br>Title: Efficient Algorithms for the Constrained Maximum Flow Problem</br><br>Author: Cenk Caliskan, Assistant Professor, University of Delaware, Department of Business Administration, 236  Alfred Lerner Hall, Newark, DE, 19711, United States, caliskanc@lerner.udel.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The constrained maximum flow problem is to send the maximum flow from a source to a sink in a directed network subject to a constraint that the total cost of the flow can be at most D. We present a specialized network simplex algorithm and a polynomial time double scaling algorithm. We then present the results of the computational tests that involve both algorithms and the existing ones. Computational tests prove that the proposed algorithms are faster than the existing algorithms.</br>
