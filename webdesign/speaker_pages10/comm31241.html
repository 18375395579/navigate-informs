<br>Title: Kernel Functions and Interior-point Methods for Conic Linear Complementarity Problems</br><br>Author: Goran Lesaja, Associate Professor, Georgia Southern University, 203 Georgia Avenue, P.O.Box 8093, Statesboro, GA, 30460, United States of America, goran@georgiasouthern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kees Roos, Yanqin Bai</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a class of polynomial primal-dual interior-point algorithms for conic linear commplementarity problems based on a new class of kernel functions. This class is fairly general and includes the classical logarithmic function, the prototype self-regular function, and non-self-regular kernel functions as special cases. The obtained complexity results are favorable; they match the currently best known iteration bounds obtained for these problems and these methods.</br>
