<br>Title: A New Lower Bound from Progressive Hedging</br><br>Author: Sarah Ryan, Iowa State University, Black Hall, Ames, United States of America, smryan@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dinakar Gade</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Nonconvexity and/or a restrictions on computation time may cause the progressive hedging (PH) algorithm to terminate with a feasible solution and a cost upper bound. A tight lower bound can provide reassurance on the quality of the PH solution.  We describe a new method to obtain lower bounds using the information prices generated by PH.  We show empirically, using these lower bounds, that for large-scale non-convex stochastic unit commitment problems, PH generates very good solutions.</br>
