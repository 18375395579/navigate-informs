<br>Title: Recursive Constrained Linear Regression with Application in Stochastic and Approximate Dynamic Programming</br><br>Author: Reza Yaesoubi, Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, Harvard Medical School, 641 Huntington Ave., Boston, MA, 02115, United States of America, reza.yaesoubi@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of constrained least squares when data are accumulating over time and the process that generates the data is not necessarily stationary. We discuss the applications of this problem in stochastic and approximate dynamic programming. We present an algorithm using a primal active-set and the Schure-compliment methods to solve constrained least squares problems in real-time. We also establish conditions under which the estimates provided by the algorithm are consistent.</br>
