<br>Title: The Design of Feature-limited Evaluation Software</br><br>Author: Jyotishka Ray, Student, University of Texas at Dallas, Naveen Jindal School of Management, Richardson, TX, 75083, United States of America, jxr114030@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Deborah Manica, Syam Menon, Vijay Mookerjee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We focus on a commonly used type of free evaluation software–one where a subset of the features in the software is disabled. Providing too many features may deter the customers in buying the original software whereas providing too less features may not generate an adequate signal to the customers. We model the vendor’s problem of designing a feature-limited demo as a non-linear integer program which is NP-complete. Scenario Aggregation algorithm is used to obtain a best feasible optimal solution</br>
