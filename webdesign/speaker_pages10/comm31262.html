<br>Title: Locating Diverse and Alternative Solutions in Multiobjective Civil Infrastructure Design Problems</br><br>Author: Brian Piper, North Carolina State University, 2500 Stinson Drive, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, bepiper@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ranji Ranjithan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Discovering alternative solutions may aid exploring a solution space to find trade-offs among competing and conflicting criteria. An evolutionary algorithm for improving decision space diversity and obtaining these alternative solutions is presented using an application to a wastewater management system design problem. Solutions found by the algorithm are analyzed and compared against solutions found by other methods.</br>
