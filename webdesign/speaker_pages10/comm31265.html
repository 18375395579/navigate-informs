<br>Title: Integrated Package and Trailer Routing in Freight Transportation</br><br>Author: Shankara Kuppa, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, skuppa@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dushyant Sharma</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In planning package and trailer routing, the freight transport industry has to satisfy a number of operational and quality-of-service constraints. We propose an integrated integer LP formulation that captures the non-linearity of the objective and additional constraints. We also suggest exact and heuristic approaches to solve the problem based on neighborhood search techniques for local improvement. We present computational results on realistic data.</br>
