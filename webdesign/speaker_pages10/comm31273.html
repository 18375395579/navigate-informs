<br>Title: Intersection Cuts for Nonlinear Integer Programming</br><br>Author: Sina Modaresi, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, sim23@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Juan Pablo Vielma, Mustafa Kilinc</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the generalization of split and intersection cuts from Mixed Integer Linear Programming to the realm of Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming. Constructing such cuts requires calculating the convex hull of the difference of two convex sets with specific geometric structures. We introduce two techniques to give precise characterizations of such convex hulls and use them to construct split and intersection cuts for several classes of sets.</br>
