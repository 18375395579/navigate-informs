<br>Title: Solving Difficult Extended Enterprise Scheduling Problems</br><br>Author: Leyuan Shi, Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, leyuan@engr.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yunpeng Pan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Real-life scheduling problems in an extended industrial enterprise are far more complex than classical models, due to the presence of complicating constraints. We propose a Nested Partitions framework to aptly deal with such constraints and provide efficient solutions to those problems. An example is presented to illustrate our idea.</br>
