<br>Title: Lifting Generalized Intersection Cuts</br><br>Author: Egon Balas, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15206, United States of America, eb17@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Selvaprabu Nadarajah</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Generalized or look-ahead intersection cuts  are obtained by first generating a collection B of points on the boundary of a lattice-free convex set, then using the reverse polar of B to generate a set of deep cuts.  Assuming that these cuts are generated in a subspace, we examine ways of lifting them into the full space.</br>
