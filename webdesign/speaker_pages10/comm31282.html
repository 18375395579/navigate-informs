<br>Title: On Connected Dominating Sets of Restricted Diameter</br><br>Author: Je Sang Sung, Texas A&M University, Industrial & Systems Engineering, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, je.sung@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Austin Buchanan, Sergiy Butenko, Vladimir Boginski</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A connected dominating set (CDS) is commonly used as a virtual backbone in the context of wireless networks. We explicitly restrict the diameter of a CDS to be no more than s leading to the concept of a dominating s-club (DsC). We show that the problem of checking the existence of a DsC is NP-complete for any fixed positive integer s. We also show that the problem of finding a minimum DsC is NP-hard, even when restricted to graphs for which a dominating clique is known to exist.</br>
