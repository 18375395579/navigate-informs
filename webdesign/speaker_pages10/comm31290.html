<br>Title: Consistent Biclustering via Fractional 0-1 Programming</br><br>Author: Stanislav Busygin, PhD Student, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, busygin@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oleg Prokopyev, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Biclustering consists in simultaneous partitioning of the set of samples and their features into classes. Samples and features classified together are supposed to have a high relevance to each other. We define the notion of consistent biclustering and prove that it implies separability of the classes by convex cones. We discuss both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The developed models involve fractional 0-1 optimization. Computational results on microarray data are reported.</br>
