<br>Title: Production Scheduling for Steel Making</br><br>Author: Jayant Kalagnanam, Research Staff Member, IBM T.J. Watson Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, PO Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10591, United States of America, jayant@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Davenport, Fatma Kilinc Karzan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Production scheduling in the hot metal shop has a flow shop flavor but with some variations.  The scheduling is done on a rolling horizon and hence the job selection/packing aspect is introduced.  In addition, there are proximity constraints on some of the resources that lead to a special structure.  Another complicating constraint is the hot metal inventory that has to be maintained between a minimum and maximum level.  We outline some formulations and an approach to address this problem.</br>
