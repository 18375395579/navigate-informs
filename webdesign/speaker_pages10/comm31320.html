<br>Title: FilMINT: A Linearizations-based MINLP Solver</br><br>Author: Kumar Abhishek, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, kua3@lehigh.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe a solver for mixed integer nonlinear programs that  implements a linearization-based algorithm in a branch-and-cut  framework. We offer new suggestions for generating and managing  linearizations that are shown to be efficient on a wide range of  MINLPs. We also use the advanced features of the MILP framework.  FilMINT uses MINTO for solving the MILP, and Filter-SQP for solving  the NLPs. Detailed computational experiments are  presented, highlighting the framework's effectiveness.</br>
