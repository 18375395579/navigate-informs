<br>Title: Combination of Heuristic and Exact Methods for Solving Set-covering Type Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Ibrahim Muter, Mr., Sabanci University, Manufacturing Systems/Industrial Eng., Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, 34956, Turkey, imuter@su.sabanciuniv.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Ilker Birbil, Guvenc Sahin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop a hybrid framework that combines some well-known meta-heuristic methods with exact methods to solve combinatorial optimization problems that can be formulated in the form of a set covering problem through Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. This framework guides the local search to take intensification and diversification decisions. We conduct experiments on well-known test problems for vehicle routing problem with time windows. Our results show that the proposed framework is promising.</br>
