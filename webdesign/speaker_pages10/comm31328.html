<br>Title: The Duality between the Perceptron Algorithm and the von Neumann Algorithm</br><br>Author: Dan Li, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, dal207@Lehigh.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tamás Terlaky</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate and reveal the duality relationship between the perceptron and the von Neumann algorithms. We interpret variants of the perceptron algorithm as variants of the von Neumann algorithm, and vice-versa; as well as transit the complexity results from one family to the other. Further, an Approximate Farkas Lemma enables us to derive bounds for the distance to the feasibility or infeasibility from approximate solutions of the alternative systems.</br>
