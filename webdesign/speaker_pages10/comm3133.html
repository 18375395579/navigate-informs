<br>Title: Solving Large Scale Stochastic Programs Using Resampling in Stochastic Decomposition</br><br>Author: Suvrajeet Sen, Professor, Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, sen@sie.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhihong Zhou, Kai Huang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic Decomposition provides one of the most effective methods for solving two-stage stochastic programs.  We propose an extension that allows cuts based on re-sampling from a subset of outcomes that have been revealed in the past.  Convergence results, and computational experiments will be reported with this new version of Stochastic Decomposition</br>
