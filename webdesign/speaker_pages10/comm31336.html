<br>Title: Does the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Measure Intensity of Preferences?</br><br>Author: Gabriela M. Sava, PhD Student, Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, 241 Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States of America, mgsava@katz.pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Luis G. Vargas</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The AHP is a decision-making method based on pairwise comparisons from an absolute scale. In this paper we construct two experiments to compare consumers?preferences for a good described by a single stimulus-response function. The results show that the AHP and the trade-offs made using the stimulus-response function are in agreement on how strongly consumers prefer the good. This provides support for the hypothesis that the AHP measures intensity of preferences.</br>
