<br>Title: Exact and Heuristic Approaches for Directional Sensor Control</br><br>Author: Hans Mittelmann, Arizona State University, Box 871804, Tempe, AZ, United States of America, MITTELMANN@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Domenico Salvagnin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The Directional Sensor Control problem (DSCP) consists in assigning a direction of view to each sensor with the goal of maximizing information gain on the location of a given set of target objects. In this paper we study and computationally evaluate exact and approximate approaches for the DSCP. In particular, we propose an exact mixed integer convex programming (MICP) formulation and several meta-heuristic approaches.</br>
