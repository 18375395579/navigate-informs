<br>Title: How to Solve Optimal Experimental Design Problems?</br><br>Author: S. Damla Ahipasaoglu, PhD Student, Cornell University, 222 University Ave. No:5, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, dse8@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael J. Todd</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: It is known that Frank-Wolfe type algorithms are very useful in  finding solutions for the D-optimal design problem of statistics,  and its dual, the Minimum Volume Enclosing Ellipsoid problem. We devise  similar algorithms for other optimal design problems such as the A-optimal  design problem. These algorithms are also locally linearly convergent and  have attractive features confirmed by computational results.</br>
