<br>Title: Generating Safe Gomory Mixed Integer Cuts</br><br>Author: Ricardo Fukasawa, GeorgiaTech, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, rfukasaw@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Cook, Marcos Goycoolea</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The validity of Gomory Mixed Integer Cuts   relies on the correctness of  arithmetic calculations, which is not guaranteed in floating point arithmetic used by modern computers.   In practice, numerical tolerances and low rank cuts are used to try to overcome this problem.   These measures, however, do not guarantee that the resulting cuts will be valid.      In this work we propose solutions to always generate valid cuts, and analyze the trade-offs in working harder to generate them.</br>
