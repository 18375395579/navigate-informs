<br>Title: Parallel Asynchronous Derivative-Free Optimization with Nonlinear Constraints</br><br>Author: Joshua Griffin, Limited Term Employee, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 9159, PO Box 969, Livermore, CA, 94551, United States, jgriffi@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tamara Kolda</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a globally convergent, derivative-free method for nonlinear programming based on generating set search (GSS). We explore several options for handling nonlinear constraints, including an augmented Lagrangian approach. Linear constraints are straightforward, requiring only conforming search directions. All methods are  implemented in parallel and asynchronously using APPSPACK. We present extensive test results using the CUTEr test set as well as real-life applications.</br>
