<br>Title: Dynamic Programming-based Cuts for the Capacitated Lot-sizing Problem</br><br>Author: Esra Buyuktahtakin, University of Florida, Industrial and Systems Engineering, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, iesra@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Hartman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we analyze a dynamic programming algorithm for the single-item, capacitated lot-sizing problem.  Furthermore, we utilize the associated linear programming formulation to generate cutting planes for the classical integer programming formulation of the CLSP and illustrate their computational effectiveness.</br>
