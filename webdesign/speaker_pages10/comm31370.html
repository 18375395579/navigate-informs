<br>Title: Stochastic Solver Strategies in LGO</br><br>Author: János D. Pintér, President  and Research Scientist, Pinter Consulting Services Inc., 129 Glenforest Drive, Halifax, NS, B3M 1J2, Canada, jdpinter@hfx.eastlink.ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: LGO is an integrated model development and solver suite to handle global and local (nonlinear) optimization problems. LGO has been implemented both as a stand-alone (compiler-based) solver, and with links to AIMMS, GAMS, MPL, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB. The stochastic sampling strategies embedded in LGO support the numerical solution of (merely) continuous GO models. We review the underlying key properties, and present illustrative examples.</br>
