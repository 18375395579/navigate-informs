<br>Title: Integrated Charge Batching and Casting Width Selection at Baosteel</br><br>Author: Zhi-Long Chen, Professor, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, ZChen@RHSmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gongshu Wang, Lixin Tang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study an integrated charge batching and casting width selection problem arising in the continuous casting operation of the steelmaking process. For the general problem, we develop a column generation based branch and bound (B&B) solution approach to obtain optimal solutions. We also consider a frequently occurring case of the problem where each steel grade is incompatible with any other grade. For this special case, we develop a two-level polynomial-time algorithm to obtain optimal solutions.</br>
