<br>Title: LEMON: A Library of Efficient Models and Optimization in Networks</br><br>Author: Alpár Jüttner, Eötvös University, Budapest, Pázmány Péter sétány 1/C, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary, alpar@cs.elte.hu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: LEMON is an open source library written in C++ language. It provides a set of efficient and easy-to-use implementation of common data structures and algorithms in the area of optimization and helps implementing new ones. The main focus is on graph structures and graph related optimization algorithms, such as shortest paths, network flows, connectivity and matching algorithms etc. LEMON also provides a simple but powerful file format to store graphs along with attributes assigned to its elements.</br>
