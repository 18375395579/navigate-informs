<br>Title: Resilient Network Design via Chance Constrained Spanning K-cores</br><br>Author: Juan Ma, Ph.D. Student, Oklahoma State University, 26 N University Place Apt 8, Stillwater, OK, 74075, United States of America, juan.ma@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Baski Balasundaram</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Given a non-negative integer k, a graph of minimum degree at least k is called a k-core. The concept of k-cores can be used to design resilient networks that preserve low diameter and high vertex-connectivity upon vertex and/or edge failures. This talk focuses on a chance-constrained version of the minimum spanning k-core problem under probabilistic edge failures, and we discuss decomposition algorithms to solve this problem.</br>
