<br>Title: A Perturbed Sums of Squares Theorem and Its Applications</br><br>Author: Masakazu Muramatsu, The University of Elector-Communications, 1-5-1, Chofugaoka, Chofu-shi, Tokyo, 182-8585, Japan, muramatu@cs.uec.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hayato Waki, Levent Tuncel</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We show a property of positive polynomials on a compact set with a small perturbation. This theorem implies that the optimal value of the corresponding SDP relaxation with sufficiently large relaxation order is bounded from below and above using the size of the perturbation and the number of variables. The SDP relaxation can be of considerably smaller dimensional than Lasserre's. We present some computational experiments of the SDP relaxation.</br>
