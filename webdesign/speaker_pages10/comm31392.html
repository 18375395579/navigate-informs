<br>Title: Sparse Approximate Solutions to Semidefinite Programs</br><br>Author: Elad Hazan, IBM Almaden, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, CA, 95120, United States of America, ehazan@cs.princeton.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose an algorithm for approximately maximizing a concave function over the bounded semi-definite cone, which produces sparse solutions. Sparsity for SDP corresponds to low rank matrices, and is a important property for both computational as well as learning theoretic reasons. As an application, building on Aaronson's recent work, we derive a linear time algorithm for Quantum State Tomography.</br>
