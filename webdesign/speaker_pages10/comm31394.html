<br>Title: Sawmill Production Planning ?A Comparison of Different Optimization Models with Simple Heuristics</br><br>Author: Maria Anna Huka, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna - Department of Economics and Social Sciences - Institute of Production and Logistics, Feistmantelstrasse 4, Vienna, AT, 1180, Austria, maria.huka@boku.ac.at</br><br>Coauthor(s): Manfred Gronalt</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The short term multi-period sawmill production planning problem is formulated as a MIP model. We compare different modelling approaches and consider both a profit margin and cost oriented objective function. The results of a multi-period planning problem are again compared to the solutions of simple heuristics applied by plant managers. We develop new heuristics and show their performance compared to an optimization approach.</br>
