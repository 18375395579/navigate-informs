<br>Title: New Features in OPTMODEL: Parallel Coroutines and Semantic Modeling</br><br>Author: Leo Lopes, Advanced Analytics Specialist, SAS Institute, SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC, 27513, United States of America, Leo.Lopes@sas.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: With one new keyword, OPTMODEL from SAS creates threads that collaborate to run solvers in parallel and execute user code serially.  Thus, you do not need to worry about process management or resource contention.  You can also access many specialized solvers by directly tying variables and parameters to problem definitions, rather than by providing traditional explicit formulations. OPTMODEL supports many problems from Network Optimization, Combinatorial Optimization, and Parameter Estimation.</br>
