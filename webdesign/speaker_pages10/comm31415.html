<br>Title: Improved Approximation Bound for Quadratic Optimization Problems with Orthogonality Constraints</br><br>Author: Anthony So, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Dept. of Sys. Eng. & Eng. Mgmt., Shatin, NT, Hong Kong - ROC, manchoso@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we consider approximation algorithms for quadratic optimization problems that contain orthogonality constraints.  In a recent work, Nemirovski (2007) gave an $O((m+n)^{1/3})$ approximation algorithm for these problems.  Using tools from functional analysis, we improve the ratio to $O(\ln\max{m,n})$.  Our techniques can also be used to improve a result of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (2007) on certain chance constrained LMI systems.</br>
