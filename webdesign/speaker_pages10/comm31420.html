<br>Title: One Stage R&D Portfolio Optimization with an Application to Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</br><br>Author: Lauren Hannah, Princeton University, Department of ORFE, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, lhannah@princeton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Stewart, Warren Powell</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This presentation gives a novel model for the one stage R&D portfolio problem, which simplifies to a stochastic combinatorial optimization problem with a noisy cost function and large integer constraint set. We give an original solution method to this problem, a stochastic gradient-based optimization algorithm. Theoretical results are given along with a numerical example for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell R&D. The results are compared to competing algorithms.</br>
