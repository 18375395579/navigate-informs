<br>Title: An Algorithm for Bilevel Integer Interdiction</br><br>Author: Yen Tang, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, United States of America, yentang@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard, J. Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for finding globally optimal solutions to  a family of bilevel integer interdiction optimization in which the  upper level minimizes the maximum of the objective of the lower level problem. We show that this algorithm, which proceeds by progressively building a suitable restriction of the lower level problem, is finitely convergent. We then present the results of a computational study aimed at evaluating the quality of our algorithm.</br>
