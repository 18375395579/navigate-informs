<br>Title: A Semidefinite Optimization Approach to Space-free Multi-row Facility Layout</br><br>Author: Miguel F. Anjos, Canada Research Chair in Discrete Nonlinear Optimization in Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, C.P. 6079, succ. Centre-ville, Montreal, QC, H3C 3A7, Canada, miguel-f.anjos@polymtl.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Philipp Hungerländer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Multi-row facility layout seeks an optimal placement of departments along rows. Large single-row problems have been solved to global optimality using semidefinite optimization. We extend the approach to space-free multi-row layout and show that if provides high-quality bounds in reasonable time.</br>
