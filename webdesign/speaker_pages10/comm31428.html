<br>Title: On S-plex and S-defective Clique Numbers of a Graph</br><br>Author: Oleg Shirokikh, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Florida, 989 Tahoe Boulevard, Unit 37L, Incline Village, NV, 89451, United States of America, olegshirokikh@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Austin Buchanan, Sergiy Butenko, Vladimir Boginski</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problems of finding the maximum s-plex and the maximum s-defective clique in a graph. These problems consider important types of hereditary clique relaxations that have applications in network-based data mining. Extensive theoretical and computational results are presented.</br>
