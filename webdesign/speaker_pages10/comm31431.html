<br>Title: Hot Started NLP Solvers: Algorithms</br><br>Author: Andreas Waechter, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, waechter@iems.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Travis Johnson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We discuss an algorithm for quickly solving a sequence of closely related nonlinear continuous optimization problems, e.g., during the solution of MINLPs or optimal control problems. The algorithm exploits hot-starts of active-set QP solvers, avoiding the refactorization of KKT matrices. This presentation describes the details of the algorithm.</br>
