<br>Title: Parallel Approach to Information-based Tree Search</br><br>Author: Rodolfo Carvajal, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, rocarvaj@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Nemhauser, Shabbir Ahmed</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: To reduce the number of nodes searched in branch-and-bound algorithms, Kilin?Karzan et al. (2009) proposed a branching scheme that collects information during the search and uses it in a restart phase. We implement variants of this approach that exploit parallelism in the collection or use of information and report computational results.</br>
