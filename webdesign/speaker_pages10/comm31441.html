<br>Title: Structural and Parametric Optimization of Separation Networks</br><br>Author: Libin Zhang, University of Illinois at Chicago, 851 S. Morgan Street, SEO218, MC063, Chicago, IL, 60607, United States of America, lzhang10@uic.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeonghwa Moon, Andreas Linninger, Benyamin Grosman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Synthesis of separation networks involves structural decisions representing the configuration of the network and continuous parameters such as the operating conditions. MINLP formulations are a common method of representation for the problems. We propose a hybrid algorithm for the solution of this MINLP separation problem combining stochastic search techniques with deterministic method. The proposed approach builds and optimizes complex column network and operating conditions simultaneously.</br>
