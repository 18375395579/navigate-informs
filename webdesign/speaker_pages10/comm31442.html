<br>Title: A Nonconvex Nonlinear Assignment Problem for Multi-sensor Data Fusion</br><br>Author: Dimitri Papageorgiou, PhD Candidate, Georgia Tech, 765 Ferst Ave, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, djpapag@gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Multi-sensor data fusion hinges on the solution of a track-to-track association problem to determine the pairing of sensor-level tracks that correspond to the same true target from which the sensor-level tracks originated. After casting this problem as a MINLP, we use submodularity properties to solve this problem exactly within a branch-and-cut framework.  Computational results illustrate the remarkable effectiveness of this approach.</br>
