<br>Title: Global Optimization of Non Convex Generalized Disjunctive Programs</br><br>Author: Juan Ruiz, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, jpruiz@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ignacio Grossmann</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This work presents a global optimization technique to solve bilinear and concave GDPs based on the disjunctive spatial branch and bound method proposed by Lee & Grossmann. The methodology builds on the work of Sawaya & Grossmann by exploiting the newly discovered hierarchy of relaxations for Linear GDP.  A number of basic theoretical properties are established and proved for the proposed method. A set of examples and case studies are presented to illustrate its computational efficiency.</br>
