<br>Title: Solving Facility Location Problems on Massively Multi-threaded Machines</br><br>Author: Cynthia Phillips, Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 1318, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States, caphill@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jonathan Berry</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: COIN contains an implementation of Barahona and Chudak's Volume algorithm (VOL). This is an improvement upon the classical subgradient algorithm for lagrangian relaxation.  Although VOL is a general lp solver, it has been applied with particular success to the p-median and uncapacitated facility location problems.  We have developed a modified VOL code that runs on massively multithreaded supercomputers and have generated this platform's first optimization results for a COIN-based code.</br>
