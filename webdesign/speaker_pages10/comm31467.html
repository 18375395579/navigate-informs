<br>Title: An Algorithm for Evacuation Planning</br><br>Author: Emrah Cimren, The Ohio State University, Dept. of Integrated Systems Engineering, 211 Baker Systems Eng., 1971 Neil Ave., Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, cimren.1@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc E. Posner</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a mixed integer nonlinear programming model for evacuation planning. The model considers shelter selection, contra-flow implementations and road availability.  This model is solved using a branch-and-cut approach with preprocessing. Data from Hurricane Katrina and existing studies establish the viability of our methodology.</br>
