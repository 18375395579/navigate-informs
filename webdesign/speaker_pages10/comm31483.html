<br>Title: Nested Space-Filling Designs for Multiple Experiments with Different Levels of Accuracy</br><br>Author: Zhiguang Qian, Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1220 Medical Sciences Center, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, zhiguang@stat.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff C. F. Wu, Boxin Tang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Construction of designs for multiple experiments with different levels of accuracy is a new issue because traditional methods deal almost exclusively with a single experiment. In this paper we propose a method for constructing nested space-filling designs for this type of multiple experiments. The construction is aided by use of Galois field and orthogonal arrays. Multiple design sets generated by the proposed method are guaranteed to possess some space-filling property.</br>
