<br>Title: A Quadratic-model-based Convergent Deterministic Black-box Optimization Algorithm</br><br>Author: Luis Rios, Graduate Student, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 537 W Melrose St Apt 133, Chicago, IL, 60657, United States of America, luisrios@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nick Sahinidis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose an algorithm for optimizing a deterministic function using no derivative information. Function evaluations are assumed expensive, limiting the total number of trials. Linear models are interpolated using points in a neighborhood, reusing as many evaluated points as possible. If more points are available, quadratic terms are included in the model, with priority to coordinates with greater values in the gradient.  Computational comparison with other solvers is presented.</br>
