<br>Title: Symmetry Compatible Formulations Via Objective Perturbations and Hierarchical Constraints</br><br>Author: Ahmed Ghoniem, Virginia Tech, Durham 250 (0118), Blacksburg, VA, 24060, United States of America, aghoniem@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hanif Sherali</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss how hierarchical constraints can be combined with objective  perturbations in a nonpreemptive multiobjective framework in order to defeat symmetry in combinatorial optimization problems. We also present the concept of symmetry compatible formulations and its relationship with these two symmetry-defeating paradigms. Computations for selected applications are presented.</br>
