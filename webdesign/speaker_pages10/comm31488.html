<br>Title: Computation of Facial Reduction</br><br>Author: Hayato Waki, Associate Professor, Kyusyu University, 744 Motooka, Nishi-ku, Fukuoka, 819-0395, Japan, waki@imi.kyushu-u.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Masakazu Muramatsu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Facial reduction algorithm (FRA) generates a smaller conic optimization problem by exploiting the degeneracy in a given conic optimization problem. However, the computation is comparable to solving the original problem. In addition, the resulting problem may lose the sparsity. In this talk, we show that one can apply FRA effectively by using structure in the original problem. For this, we present some examples. This is a jointwork with Professor Masakazu Muramatsu (UEC).</br>
