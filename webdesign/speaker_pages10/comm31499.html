<br>Title: A Column Generation Algorithm for the Cross-layer Survivable Network Design</br><br>Author: Tachun Lin, Assistant Professor, Cameron University, 2800 W Gore Blvd, Lawton, OK, 73505, United States of America, tlin@cameron.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhili Zhou</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a mixed-integer programming model and a column generation algorithm for the cross-layer survivable routing problem. The proposed model requires less number of constraints and variables, where the number is similar to those used in the regular network routing problem. The pricing problem in one of the sub-problems of the proposed column generation algorithm is still exponential, but the computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the column generation algorithm.</br>
