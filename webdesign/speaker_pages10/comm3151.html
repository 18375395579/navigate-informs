<br>Title: (Fraction) Dimension of a Poset and Constraint Feedback Arc Set Problem.</br><br>Author: Kamal Jain, Senior Researcher, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052, United States, kjain@cc.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rajneesh Hegde</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The dimension of a partially ordered set (poset) is the minimum integer k such that the partial order can be expressed as the intersection of k total orders. We prove it is hard to approximate the dimension of a poset with $n$ elements within a factor $n^{0.5 - \epsilon} for any $\epsilon > 0$. The same hardness of approximation holds for the fractional version of poset dimension.    On a positive side we consider a minimum constrained feedback arc set problem in tournament....</br>
