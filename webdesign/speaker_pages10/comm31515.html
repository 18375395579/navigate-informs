<br>Title: Minimal Valid Inequalities for Constrained Infinite Relaxations of MILPs</br><br>Author: Sercan Yildiz, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, syildiz@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Our results are relevant to the theory of cutting planes for mixed integer linear programs (MILP). We consider the infinite relaxation of a MILP in tableau form. We first generalize a classical result of Gomory and Johnson which characterizes minimal valid inequalities for this model. We then use this characterization to establish necessary conditions for the unique lifting of inequalities obtained for a variant of this model in which all nonbasic variables are continuous.</br>
