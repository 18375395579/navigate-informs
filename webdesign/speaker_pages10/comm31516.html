<br>Title: Improving Christofides' Algorithm for the s-t Path Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</br><br>Author: David Shmoys, Professor, Cornell University, 231 Rhodes Hall, 136 Hoy Road, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, david.shmoys@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Kleinberg, Hyung-Chan An</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present an approximation algorithm for the metric -t path TSP (the path variant that connects two specified endpoints), which is guaranteed to find a solution of cost within a factor of the golden ratio of optimal in polynomial time. Christofides is a 5/3-approximation algorithm for this problem, and no prior improvements were known. We modify this algorithm so that it chooses the initial spanning tree based on an optimal solution to a natural LP relaxation, surpassing the 20-year-old bound.</br>
