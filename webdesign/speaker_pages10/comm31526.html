<br>Title: A Contraction-expansion Algorithm for the Capacitated Minimum Cost Network Flow Problem</br><br>Author: Jacques Desrosiers, Professor, HEC Montréal and GERAD, 3000 Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, Qc, H3T2A7, Canada, jacques.desrosiers@gerad.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Bertrand Gauthier, Marco E. Luebbecke</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The Improved Primal Simplex (IPS) only makes non-degenerate pivots while solving LPs. Hence it takes a finite number of iterations on integral data network flow problems. We show that IPS is strongly polynomial for the assignment and the shortest path problems. Moreover, with a slight modification, it becomes strongly polynomial for solving the capacitated minimum cost network flow problem. The algorithm is similar to the minimum mean cycle-cancelling algorithm of Goldberg and Tarjan (1989).</br>
