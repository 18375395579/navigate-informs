<br>Title: Smoothing Techniques for the Computation of Nash Equilibria of Sequential Games</br><br>Author: Javier Pena, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, jfp@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Samid Hoda, Tuomas Sandholm, Andrew Gilpin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Nash equilibrium problem for a two-person, zero-sum sequential game can be formulated as a saddle-point problem over a pair of polytopes that encode the sequential nature of the game.  We show that modern smoothing techniques can be successfully applied to this problem. The heart of our approach is a general scheme that constructs prox-functions for the polytopes in the saddle-point formulation.</br>
