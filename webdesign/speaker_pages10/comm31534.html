<br>Title: A Second-order Method for Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints</br><br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Asst. Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 216 Transportation Bldg, Urbana, Il, 61822, United States of America, udaybag@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Walter Murray, Michael Saunders</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the solution of mathematical programs with complementarity constraints. We present a primal-dual method reliant on both negative curvature and Newton directions. A curvilinear search over a combination of these directions is employed for purposes of globalization. We prove that the iterates converge to a second-order KKT point. We conclude by discussing the performance of the algorithm on a test problem set of quadratic programs with equilibrium constraints.</br>
