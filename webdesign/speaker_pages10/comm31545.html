<br>Title: Convex Sets as Invariant Sets for Linear Systems</br><br>Author: Yunfei Song, Lehigh University, 337 S. New St., Apt. 202, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, yus210@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tamás Terlaky</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a novel, unified, general approach to analyze sufficient and necessary conditions under which polyhedra, polyhedral cones, ellipsoids, or Lorenz cones are invariant sets for a linear continuous or discrete system. We show that the forward Euler method preserves positive invariance for polyhedra or polyhedral cones, while the backward Euler method preserves positive invariance for all the four sets.</br>
