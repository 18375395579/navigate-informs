<br>Title: Optimization Subject to Stochastic Ordering Constraints</br><br>Author: Darinka Dentcheva, Professor, Stevens Institute of Technology, Mathematical Sciences, Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, ddentche@stevens.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrzej Ruszczynski, Rene Henrion</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We discuss stochastic optimization problems involving a continuum of probabilistic (chance) constraints. These are called also stochastic dominance of first order or stochastic ordering constraints. Necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality will be reviewed. We focus on the stability of the problem when the underlaying probability distributions are subject to perturbations, e.g., when the distributions are estimated. At the end we sketch several applications of the model.</br>
