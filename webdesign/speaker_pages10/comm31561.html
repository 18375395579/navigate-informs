<br>Title: A Generic Column-generation-based Framework for Airline Planning</br><br>Author: Thomas Schickinger, Product Manager, Lufthansa Systems, Fritschestr. 27-28, Berlin, BE, 10585, Germany, thomas.schickinger@lhsystems.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we report on recent developments of a framework for  airline optimization problems. The core of this framework consists of generic components for solving LP and IP problems, and provides an extensible implementation of a column-generation based solver. We show how this generic part is adapted to different crew and aircraft planning problems and how the structure of the problem at hand is exploited by approximation techniques and problem-specific control of the path search.</br>
