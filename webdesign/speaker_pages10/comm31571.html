<br>Title: Strong MIP Formulations of Chance Constrained Linear Programs with Random Right-hand Side</br><br>Author: James Luedtke, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, jluedtke@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shabbir Ahmed, George Nemhauser</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present strong mixed-integer programming formulations for the chance constrained linear program with finite sample space and random RHS.  We develop valid inequalities and an extended formulation based on a single row relaxation.  Computational results indicate this approach can be used to solve large scale problems, with the size of the sample space in the thousands and dimension of the random RHS in the hundreds.</br>
