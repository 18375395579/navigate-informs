<br>Title: Generalized A-Optimality and Hybrid Designs for Two-Color Microarrays</br><br>Author: Theodore Allen, Associate Professor, Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, allen.515@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nilgun Ferhatosmanoglu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Several researchers have proposed optimal experimental plans based on A-optimality to pair samples for testing using two-color microarrays. We show that if model misspecification or bias is considered in the formulation, the so-called reference designs that practitioners prefer perform better compared with A-optimal loop designs. Next, we propose an integer programming formulation based on what we call generalized A-optimality and display optimal solutions which we call hybrid designs.</br>
