<br>Title: Scheduling Cluster Tools in Semiconductor Manufacturing</br><br>Author: Emrah Cimren, Industrial Engineer, Micron Technology, 9600 Godwin Drive, Manassas, VA, 20110, United States of America, ecimren@micron.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc Posner, DJ Kim</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Cluster tools, which consist of several processing modules and transport robots, are one of the expensive equipments used in semiconductor manufacturing. We develop a methodology to determine optimal schedules for cluster tools. The proposed approach provides route of products in the tool with the minimum cycle time. We provide properties of optimal solution and a characterization of the optimal schedule. Computational results show the effectiveness of the methodology in practice.</br>
