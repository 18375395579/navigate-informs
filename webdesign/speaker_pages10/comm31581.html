<br>Title: Complexity for a Class of Stochastic Capacitated Lot-sizing Problems</br><br>Author: Yongpei Guan, School of Industrial Engineering, University of Oklahoma, 202 West Boyd Street, Norman, OK, United States of America, yguan@ou.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Miller</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we study the complexity of stochastic capacitated lot-sizing problems with backlogging. We discuss both constant and variant capacitated cases. For the constant capacitated case, we develop a polynomial time algorithm for any general scenario-tree structure. For the variant capacitated case, the problem is NP-hard for the general scenario-tree structure case. However, the problem is polynomial solvable if each non-leaf node in the scenario tree contains at least two children.</br>
