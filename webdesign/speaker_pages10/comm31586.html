<br>Title: Mini-batch Stochastic Approximation Methods for Constrained Nonconvex Stochastic Programming</br><br>Author: Saeed Ghadimi, University of Florida, P.O. Box 210020, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, sghadimi@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hongchao Zhang, Guanghui Lan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a randomized mini-batch stochastic approximation method for solving constrained nonconvex stochastic programming problems. Complexity analysis of finding an approximate stationary point of this kind of problems is provided. Some computational results are also presented to show practical performance of the proposed algorithm.</br>
