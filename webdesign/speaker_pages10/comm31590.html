<br>Title: Maximum Degree-based Gamma-quasi-Clique Detection Problem</br><br>Author: Grigory Pastukhov, Research Assistant, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, gpastukhov@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oleg Prokopyev, Vladimir Boginski, Alexander Veremyev</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider degree-based clique relaxation called gamma-quasi-clique. Gamma-quasi-clique is a subgraph such that each node has a degree at least gamma*(n-1), where n is the number of nodes in the subgraph. We prove that the maximum gamma-quasi-clique problem is NP-complete, and develop heuristic and exact branch-and-bound algorithm for this problem.</br>
