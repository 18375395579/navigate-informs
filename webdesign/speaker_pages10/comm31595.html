<br>Title: A Primal-dual First-order Method  for  Linear Cone Programming</br><br>Author: Zhaosong Lu, Assistant Professor, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada, zhaosong@sfu.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We first reformulate linear cone programming as primal-dual smooth convex minimization problems. Then we discuss Nesterov's first-order method  for solving them, and the associated iteration-complexity bound is derived. The proposed   method is finally applied to solve some large-scale linear cone programming problems arising from compressed sensing and date mining.</br>
