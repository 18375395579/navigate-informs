<br>Title: Taking Advantage of Problem Structure in Optimization of Radiation Therapy</br><br>Author: Anders Forsgren, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Department of Mathematics, Stockholm, SE-100 44, Sweden, andersf@kth.se</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fredrik Carlsson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The optimization problem in IMRT may be formulated in several ways. One approach is to solve a fluence map optimization problem and then convert the solution to machine parameters of the treatment unit. Alternatively, one may solve an optimization problem in the machine parameters, either directly, by a column generation approach or by combining these two approaches. We discuss how one may take advantage of problem structure in the above approaches.</br>
