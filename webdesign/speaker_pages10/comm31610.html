<br>Title: The Solution of General Finite Linear Systems via Flexible New GGP Dual Variational Principles</br><br>Author: Elmor Peterson, Systems Science Consulting, 3717 Williamsborough Court, Raleigh, NC, 27609, United States, elpeterson@alumni.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: These principles, based on linearly constrained generalized GP duality, provide infinitely many new iterative methods for solving each system of linear equations and/or inequalities, including every large-scale LP problem. Each method requires only the unconstrained approximate minimization of a convex function that can be separable. This infinite flexibility is likely to provide serious competition for previously developed iterative methodologies, such as interior-point methodology.</br>
