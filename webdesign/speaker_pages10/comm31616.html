<br>Title: Analysis of MILPs for the Pooling Problem</br><br>Author: Akshay Gupte, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, Martin Hall, Dept. of Math Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, agupte@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Santanu Dey</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We analyze MILP relaxations and restrictions of the pooling problem, a NP-hard bilinear program. We first prove that the ratio of any piecewise linear relaxation value to the global optimal value is at most the number of output nodes N, and for any e > 0, there exists a instance where this ratio is at least N - e. Next, we design a MILP-based heuristic that is guaranteed to provide solutions within a factor of N. This heuristic performs remarkably well on large-scale test instances.</br>
