<br>Title: Equivalence of Piecewise-linear Approximation and Lagrangian Relaxation for NRM</br><br>Author: Sumit Kunnumkal, Assistant Professor, Indian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, A.P, AP, India, sumit_kunnumkal@isb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kalyan Talluri</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The network RM problem can be formulated as a DP with an exponentially large state space.  A number of heuristics have been proposed to approximate it. Notable amongst these are ADP methods that approximate the value function by basis functions and decomposition methods that relax the constraints of the DP to solve simpler DPs.  We show that these two seemingly distinct approaches coincide, i.e., the piecewise-linear approximation method and the Lagrangian relaxation method are one and the same.</br>
