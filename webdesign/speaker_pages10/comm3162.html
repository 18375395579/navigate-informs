<br>Title: Linear Programming Plus Branch-and-cut for Solving Certain Difficult QUBO Problems</br><br>Author: Gabriel Tavares, Dash Optimization, part of Fair Isaac, 560 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632, United States of America, gabriel.tavares@dashoptimization.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Endre Boros</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A linear optimization framework is proposed to solve the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. It consists of 2 stages: first it calculates an optimal Basic Feasible Solution (BFS) to the relaxation of the Linearization Model (LM) for QUBO plus some valid cuts; and second it solves LM enhanced with the subset of cuts binding at the BFS. The effectiveness of the approach, implemented using Xpress-Mosel, is shown when solving: minimum 3-partition, MAX-CUT and MAX-SAT.</br>
