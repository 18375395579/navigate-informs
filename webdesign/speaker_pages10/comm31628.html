<br>Title: Two Families of Facets for Two Dimensional Infinite Group Problems.</br><br>Author: Santanu Dey, School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, sdey@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present the first two proven families of facet-defining inequalities for two-dimensional infinite group problems (2DIGP). The first family uses inequalities of the one dimensional infinite group problem as building blocks. This construction provides a complete characterization of piecewise linear facets of the 2DIGP that have two gradients. The second family has three gradients.  The coefficients of its continuous variables are not dominated by those of one-dimensional group cuts.</br>
