<br>Title: Message-passing Algorithms for Bounded Depth Steiner Trees</br><br>Author: Riccardo Zecchina, Professor, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, Turin, 10129, Italy, riccardo.zecchina@polito.it</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mohsen Bayati, Christian Borgs, Alfredo Braunstein, Jennifer Chayes, Abolfazl Ramezanpour</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Minimum Weight Steiner Tree (MST) is a basic optimization problem over networks. Here we discuss a general technique to translate the imposed global connectivity constrain into many local ones that can be analyzed with  Belief Propagation techniques. This approach leads to a new message-passing  algorithm for MST with bounded depth and for its generalizations.  We discuss the statistical  properties of optimal MSTs on random graphs of various types  together with some benchmark examples.</br>
