<br>Title: Extensions of Classical Multidimensional Scaling for Molecular Embedding Problems</br><br>Author: Robert Michael Lewis, Associate Professor, College of William & Mary, Department of Mathematics, PO Box 8795, Williamsburg, VA, 23187-8795, United States, buckaroo@math.wm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Trosset, Ian Grooms</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We discuss an approach to the embedding problem in structural molecular biology. For an n-atom molecule we treat the n(n-1)/2 interatomic distances (dissimilarities) as independent variables. We use the strain criterion from classical MDS to steer the dissimilarities to a set of physically realizable interatomic distances.  Our approach results in a large-scale constrained nonconvex spectral optimization problem. As we discuss, the solution of this problem is computationally tractable.</br>
