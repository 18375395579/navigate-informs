<br>Title: Decomposition Methods for Nonlinear Programming Under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Ankur Kulkarni, Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engg, UIUC, Urbana, IL, United States, akulkar3@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the two-period stochastic nonlinear programming and consinder the use of sequential quadratic programming for the solution of such problems. To solve the quadratic approximations, we present two stochastic QP solvers. The first is based on the inexact cut version of the L-shaped method for stochastic QPs. The second is a QP extension of the trust-region method suggested by Linderoth and Wright. We test the  performance of the algorithm(s) on a nonlinear programming test problem set.</br>
