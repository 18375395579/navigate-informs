<br>Title: Portfolio Seletion with VaR Constriant</br><br>Author: Siming Huang, Professor, Inst. of Policy and Management, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, 100190, China, simhua@casipm.ac.cn</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We introduce the portfolio selection models with VaR constriant. We show that they can be transformed into a quadratic programming problem or quadraticlly constrined quadratic programming problem under very general probability distribution assumption. We will propose interior point algorithms for solving them.</br>
