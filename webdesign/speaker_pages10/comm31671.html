<br>Title: Using Computational Grids for Solving Stochastic Programs</br><br>Author: Jeff Linderoth, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706-1572, United States, jtl3@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Udom Janjarassuk, Jierui Shen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The theme of this talk is how to (easily) exploit the massive  computing power offered by collections of loosely-federated,  nondedicated computational units for solving stochastic programs.    Experience with solving two-stage and multi-stage linear recourse  problems will be presented.</br>
