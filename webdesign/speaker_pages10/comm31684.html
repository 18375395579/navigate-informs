<br>Title: Extending Convex Approximation Schemes using Switching Times</br><br>Author: Alan King, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, kingaj@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Optimization of decision problems under uncertainty faces the curse of dimensionality.  A frequently used approach (for example in neuro-dynamic programming) is to optimize over a low-dimensional policy space.  The problem is how to extend this policy region to incorporate new directions of solution progress.  We discuss a method revise the solution based on the selection of a switching time and show how this can be reduced to a tractable two-stage stochastic programming sub-problem.</br>
