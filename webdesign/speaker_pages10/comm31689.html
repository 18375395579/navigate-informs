<br>Title: Evolutionary Approach to Bilevel Optimization: An Efficient Algorithm and Test-problems</br><br>Author: Pekka Malo, Assistant Professor, Aalto University School of Business, Runeberginkatu 22-24, Helsinki, Finland, pekka.malo@aalto.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ankur Sinha</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Bilevel programming is a branch of optimization, which contains a nested optimization problem within the constraints of the outer optimization problem. In this paper, we discuss an evolutionary algorithm for solving general single-objective bilevel problems. We also present a procedure for designing controlled test problems with different types of commonly encountered difficulties. The obtained results can be used as a benchmark while evaluating alternative approaches.</br>
