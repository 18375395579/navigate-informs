<br>Title: Robust Scheduling on Uniform Parallel Machines to Minimize Total Flow Time</br><br>Author: Xiaoqing Xu, PhD student, School of Management, Xi’an Jiaotong University, P.O. Box 2268, No.28, Xianning West Road, Xi'an, 710049, China, xxq.107@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wentian Cui, Jun Lin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper addresses a uniform parallel machine scheduling problem wherein the job processing times are uncertain but lie in closed intervals. A robust (min-max regret) model is proposed. To solve this NP-hard problem, we first prove that the maximal regret for any schedule can be obtained by solving an assignment problem. We then develop two MILP formulations and a 2-approximation algorithm. Finally, computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods.</br>
