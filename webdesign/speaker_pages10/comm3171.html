<br>Title: Scalable Parallel Solution of Stochastic Unit Commitment Via Scenario-based Decomposition</br><br>Author: Jean-Paul Watson, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 5800, MS 1326, Albuquerque, NM, 87113, United States of America, jwatson@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): David L. Woodruff, Roger Wets</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic unit commitment remains a serious challenge at utility scales, in terms of obtaining high-quality solutions in tractable run-times given large scenario trees. To address this challenge, leveraging moderate-scale cluster computing, we describe an implementation of Progressive Hedging (PH) that we are developing under the Department of Energy's ARPA-E GENI program. We describe algorithmic challenges and our proposed solutions to large-scale parallel deployment of PH.</br>
