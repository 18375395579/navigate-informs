<br>Title: Monte Carlo Methods for Assessing Solution Quality in Stochastic Programs</br><br>Author: David Morton, Associate Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, Graduate Program in Operations Research, 1 University Station, C2200, Austin, TX, 78712-0292, United States, morton@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Amit Partani, Guzin Bayraksan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Determining whether a solution is of high quality (optimal or near optimal) is a fundamental question in optimization theory and algorithms. We discuss Monte Carlo sampling-based procedures for assessing solution quality in stochastic programs. Here, quality is defined via the optimality gap and our procedures' output is a one-sided confidence interval on this gap.</br>
