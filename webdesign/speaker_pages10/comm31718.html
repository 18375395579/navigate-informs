<br>Title: Strong Formulations for Convex Functions Over Nonconvex Sets</br><br>Author: Daniel Bienstock, Columbia University, Dept. of IEOR, New York, NY, United States of America, dano@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alex Michalka</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We describe continuing work for obtaining the convex hull of sets representing quadratic polynomials over nonconvex sets, such as the complement of a polyhedron, the complement of a paraboloid, or the complement of a union of polyhedra and paraboloids.</br>
