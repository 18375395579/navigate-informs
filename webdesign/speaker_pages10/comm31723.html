<br>Title: Games, Optimization, and Online Algorithms</br><br>Author: Martin Zinkevich, Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, 2-21 Athabasca Hall, Edmonton, AB, Canada, maz@cs.ualberta.ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Texas Hold-em is a huge multi-agent, partial information game. While an equilibrium exists, this is not the best strategy against non-equilibrium play. I will present a novel way of finding an approximate equilibrium involving approximately solving a linear program (previously considered intractable) such that experts that can be useful against suboptimal strategies can be extracted from the solution.</br>
