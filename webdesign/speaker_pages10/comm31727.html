<br>Title: Risk-neutral Second Best Toll Pricing</br><br>Author: Xuegang (Jeff) Ban, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th St, JEC 4034, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Troy, NY, 12180, United States of America, banx@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ferris</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study second best toll pricing (SBTP) when the user equilibrium (UE) solution is not unique. In this case, we show how the toll designer's risk-taking behaviors can be considered. In particular, if one wants to minimize the expected objective value as UE solution varies, a risk-neutral SBTP can be modeled as a stochastic program. We illustrate such risk-neutral SBTP concept and show how to solve it by the simulation-based optimization technique.</br>
