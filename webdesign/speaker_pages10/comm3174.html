<br>Title: Multi-objective Programming with Simulation Optimization to Improve Patient Flow Distribution</br><br>Author: Jie Song, Peking University, NO. 298,Chengfu Road,Haidian District, Beijing, 100871, China, songjie@coe.pku.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yunzhe Qiu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Our research proposed a methodology to find the optimal patient flow  with multi-dimension inputs and outputs for the multi-level healthcare system. Our approach integrates  multi-objective programming and simulation optimization , and an algorithm based on Stochastic Approximation and improved by the Response Surface Method is used. A local case study is carried out, and a comparison between our optimization algorithm to the Random Search Approach indicates that our method is faster.</br>
