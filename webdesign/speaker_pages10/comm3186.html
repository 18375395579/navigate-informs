<br>Title: Large-scale Column Generation Approaches for Solving QPMIPs Arising from Cancer Treatment</br><br>Author: Eva Lee, Associate Professor and Director, Georgia Institute of Technology, Ctr for Operations Research in Medicine, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kyungduck Cha</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We describe a column generation scheme that was designed for solving intractable large-scale quadratic mixed integer programs arising from cancer treatment. Problem characteristics will be described and computational results and their clinical significance on real patient data will be analyzed.</br>
