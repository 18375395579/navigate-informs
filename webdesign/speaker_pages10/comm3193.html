<br>Title: Reformulations of 0-norm Problems: An Empirical Study</br><br>Author: Mingbin Feng, Ph.D. Candidate, Northwestern University, 605 Garrett PL, APT 260, Evanston, Il, 60201, United States of America, mingbinfeng2011@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andreas Waechter, Jong-Shi Pang, John Mitchell, Xin Shen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Solution sparsity is an important concern in applications such as compressed sensing and machine learning.  In contrast to the common approach of 1-norm regularization, we propose a 0-norm regularization using complementarity constraints.  The resulting MPCCs are solved using existing NLP software. Although the MPCC formulation has exponentially many local solutions, we present a numerical study suggesting this heuristic often finds sparser solutions than the 1-norm approach.</br>
