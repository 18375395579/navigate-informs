<br>Title: Conjectured Supply Function Equilibria Under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Andrew Liu, Johns Hopkins University, Whiting School of Engineering, Baltimore, MD, United States, lliu@jhu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Uday Shanbhag</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We employ the Conjectured Supply Function approach  to model a two-period stochastic game in which players compete in supply functions in the first period and make generation (recourse) decisions in the second-period. The resulting problem may be formulated as a stochastic complementarity problem. A scalable algorithm for solving such a problem is suggested and its convergence properties are discussed briefly. Finally, some results from a small electrical network are reported.</br>
