<br>Title: Minimizing Total Completion Time in Two-Machine Flow Shops With Exact Delays</br><br>Author: Hairong Zhao, Assistant Professor, Purdue University Calumet, Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, Hammond, IN, 46323, United States of America, hairong@calumet.purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yumei Huo, Haibing Li</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing total completion time in the two-machine flow shop with exact delay. This problem is a generalization of the no-wait flow shop problem which is known to be strongly NP-hard. We focus on permutation schedules. We first prove that some simple algorithms can find the optimal schedules for some special cases. Then for the general case, we design some heuristics as well as meta-heuristics whose performances are shown to be very well by computational experiments.</br>
