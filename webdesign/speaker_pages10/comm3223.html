<br>Title: A Polynomial Time Algorithm for Rayleigh Ratio on Discrete Variables</br><br>Author: Dorit S Hochbaum, UC Berkeley, Department of IEOR, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, hochbaum@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A general form of minimizing the Rayleigh ratio on discrete variables is shown here, for the first time, to be polynomial time solvable.  This is significant since major problems in clustering, partitioning and imaging can be presented as the Rayleigh ratio minimization on discrete variables and an orthogonality constraint.  When the discreteness constraints are relaxed, the problems can be solved using the ``spectral technique.  The discrete relaxation is shown to be more efficient than the spectral method, and in practice delivering better quality solutions.</br>
