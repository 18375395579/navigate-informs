<br>Title: Heredity and Provenance Detection of Binary Codes, a Network Science based Approach</br><br>Author: Liying Cui, Senior Project Manager, Starbucks Coffee Company, 2401 Utah Ave S, S-SC6, Seattle, WA, 98134, United States of America, cui.liying@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Soundar Kumara</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a network based method to detect the heredity, provenance and variants of binary codes. Though semantic and context based approaches exist to identify the nature of software, methods to relate binary codes are sparse. Science for identifying the relationship between binary codes is in early stages. We present a networks based approach to relate binary codes, which will form the foundation to identify the relationship between binary codes and to develop mitigation strategies.</br>
