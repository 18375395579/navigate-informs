<br>Title: A Parallel Branch-and-price Approach for the Project Prioritization Problem</br><br>Author: Ali Koc, University of Texas at Austin, Operations Research and Industrial, Engineering, ETC 5.120, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, alikoc@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ernie Kee, David Morton, Elmira Popova, Stephen Hess</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider an annual budgeting problem from the South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company. The portfolio of projects obtained by the classical multi-knapsack formulation proves volatile, as the problem data is uncertain. We, instead, rank the projects, considering their structural and stochastic dependencies. The problem amounts to a two-stage stochastic integer program, which in turn, is a large scale integer program. As a solution approach, we use parallel branch-and-price framework.</br>
