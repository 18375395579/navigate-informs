<br>Title: Applying PEBBL Parallel Branch and Bound to Protein/Peptide Docking and Maximum Monomial Agreement</br><br>Author: Jonathan Eckstein, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, jeckstei@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Phillips, William E. Hart</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We discuss applying the PEBBL parallel branch-and-bound library to a quadratic semi-assignment approximation of the protein-peptide docking problem, with a strengthened bounding procedure having the same complexity as prior bounds. This application exhibits strongly and reproducibly superlinear speedups definitively attributed to processor cache behavior.  We also describe applying PEBBL to maximum monomial agreement, an problem arising from machine learning.</br>
