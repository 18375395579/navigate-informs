<br>Title: Risk and Expectation-based Models and Algorithms for Insuring Critical Paths</br><br>Author: Siqian Shen, University of Florida, Weil Hall 303, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, sshen@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cole Smith, Shabbir Ahmed</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a class of two-stage stochastic optimization problems  arising in the protection of vital arcs in a critical path network,  where one must trade off costs in insuring arcs with expected  penalties from late completion times. We analyze different risk-level  cases, provide various formulations, and employ RLT to remodel the  problem to be amenable to solution via Benders decomposition. We employ SAA for scenario generation and demonstrate the computational  efficacy of our approach.</br>
