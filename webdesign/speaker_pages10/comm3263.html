<br>Title: A Nonlinear Semidefinite Relaxation for the Worst-case Linear Optimization under Uncertainties</br><br>Author: Tao Zhu, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S.

Such a problem arises from numerous applications such as systemic risk estimate in finance and stochastic optimization. A tractable nonlinear semidefinite relaxation model is derived. Our preliminary experimental results illustrate that the nonlinear SDR can provide very tight bounds for the original WCLO and is able to locate the exact global solution in most cases.</br>
