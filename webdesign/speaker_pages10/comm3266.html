<br>Title: A Decomposition Algorithm for the Maximum K-club Problem</br><br>Author: Esmaeel Moradi, Student, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74075, United States of America, esmaeel.moradi@mail.okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Baski Balasundaram</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A subgraph of diameter at most k is called a k-club, which includes clique as a special case when k equals 1 and is a relaxation when k is larger than 1. This graph theoretic clique relaxation can be used to model low-diameter clusters in graph based data mining applications in bioinformatics and social network analysis. This talk discusses a decomposition approach to solve the integer programming formulation of this problem and presents preliminary computational results.</br>
