<br>Title: On the O(1/k) Convergence of Asynchronous Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</br><br>Author: Ermin Wei, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 32-D640 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, erminwei@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Asuman Ozdaglar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a network of agents that are cooperatively optimizing a problem with separable objective functions and linear coupling constraints. Recent literature studied distributed solutions through either subgradient based methods with slow convergence rate or Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based methods, which require a synchronous implementation. In this paper, we present a novel asynchronous ADMM based distributed method and show that it converges at rate O(1/k).</br>
