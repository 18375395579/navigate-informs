<br>Title: Generalizations of Continuous Mixing Set: Extended Formulations and Facets</br><br>Author: Manish Bansal, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, TAMU 3131, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, bansal@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kiavash Kianfar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We introduce and study some important generalizations of the well-studied continuous mixing set. We develop extended formulations and facet-defining cutting planes for these sets. We also present an exact separation algorithm for the developed cuts. Our computational results show that our cuts are very effective for the multi-module lot-sizing problems with(out) backlogging, resulting in considerable reduction in the integrality gap, the number of nodes, and solution time.</br>
