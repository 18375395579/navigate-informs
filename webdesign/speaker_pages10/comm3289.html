<br>Title: Object-algebraic Modeling Using POAMS: The Platform for Object-algebraic Modeling Systems</br><br>Author: Leonardo B. Lopes, Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, Systems & Industrial Eng. Department, 1127 E. North Campus Drive, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, leo@sie.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Hart</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we focus on how object-oriented concepts, in particular specialization, in combination with algebraic modeling, aids the development of both optimization models and optimization algorithms. As expected, the object-algebraic approach makes the development of new models easier and less error-prone. In optimization modeling we get an extra benefit: the object-algebraic description of a model often highlights important relationships that lead to decomposition approaches.</br>
