<br>Title: The Push Tree Problem-accounting for Tradeoffs of Push/Pull Mechanisms in Information Distribution</br><br>Author: Stefan Voss, Professor, University of Hamburg, IWI - Von-Melle-Park 5, Hamburg, HH, 20146, Germany, stefan.voss@uni-hamburg.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrea Raiconi, Andreas Fink</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The push tree problem is a mixture of building multicast trees with respect to nodes receiving pieces of information while further nodes may obtain information from the closest node within the tree by means of shortest paths. We present some metaheuristics as well as worst case results for simple heuristics.</br>
