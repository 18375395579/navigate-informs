<br>Title: Using Cross-entropy for Solving the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem</br><br>Author: Adji Cisse</br><br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Matis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this presentation, we show how Cross-Entropy methods may be used to find the stochastic shortest path through a networks.  At the core of this approach is the use of truncated saddlepoint approximations for the distribution of path lengths.</br>
