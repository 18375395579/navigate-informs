<br>Title: The Colourful Feasibility Problem</br><br>Author: Tamon Stephen, Simon Fraser University, 14th Floor Central City Tower, 250-13450 102nd Ave., Surrey, BC, V3T0A3, Canada, tamon@sfu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sui Huang, Tamas Terlaky, Antoine Deza</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A colourful version of the linear programming feasibility problem is to find a feasible basis that respects a given colouring (partition) of the vertices.  This problem was presented by Barany and Onn in 1997, it is still not known if a polynomial time algorithm exists.  We compare their methods with new methods.  We show that some algorithms can lead to cycling or slow convergence, but we provide extensive numerical experiments which show that others perform much better than predicted.</br>
