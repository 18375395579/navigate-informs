<br>Title: A Hybrid Parallel Decomposition Scheme for Nested Benders Decomposition</br><br>Author: Andre Diniz, DSc, CEPEL, Rua Dois de Dezembro 123/601, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 22220-040, Brazil, diniz@cepel.br</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tiago Santos</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Parallel processing is usually applied to different scenario paths in stochastic programming. We propose a new hybrid parallel processing scheme to solve stochastic programs by nested Benders decomposition, where the parallelization is performed by subproblem in deterministic parts and near the beginning of the scenario tree (in order to avoid idle processors) and by scenario path further in the tree. Results are presented for the mid-term hydrothermal coordination problem.</br>
