<br>Title: Optimal Deployment of USAR Personnel in Large-scale Disasters</br><br>Author: Lichun (Lisa) Chen, Optimal deployment of USAR personnel in large-scale disasters, University of Maryland, University of Maryland, Department of Civil and Environmental En, College park, MD, 20742, United States of America, lcchen@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elise Miller-Hooks</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper is seeking to solve the routing problem of multiple urban search and rescue (USAR) teams in post-disaster situations. The objective is to save the largest number of people considering that the likelihood of survival decreases by time. Because of the dynamic and uncertain nature of post-disaster conditions, the problem is formulated as a stochastic integer program and solved by specially designed algorithm. A case study is applied to illustrate this algorithm.</br>
