<br>Title: On Some Disjunctive Relaxations Related to Pseudo-boolean Optimization</br><br>Author: Michel Minoux, michel.minoux@lip6.fr</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The use of the so-called 'elementary closure of Lift-and-Project'    cuts has been shown to provide good bounds for some classes of quadratic pseudo-boolean problems such as MAX-2SAT (see Bonami & Minoux, 2006). We  investigate further disjunctive relaxations for such problems, exhibit links to other known relaxations (Sherali-Adams, Lovasz-Schrijver) and provide some preliminary computational results.</br>
