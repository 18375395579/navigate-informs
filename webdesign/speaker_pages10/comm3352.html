<br>Title: A Team Formation Problem based on Social Structure Measures</br><br>Author: Alireza Farasat, PhD Student, University at Buffalo, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, 327 Bell Hall, Amherst, NY, 14260, United States of America, afarasat@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Nikolaev</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical approach to a Team Formation Problem (TFP) with a pool of individuals embedded into a network. Network structure in the resulting teams is assumed to influence team performance. The problem is proven NP-Hard, and its IP formulation is provided. An algorithm employing the variable depth neighborhood Lin-Kernighan idea is presented to tackle TFP on large networks.</br>
