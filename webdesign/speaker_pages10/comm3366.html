<br>Title: Finitely Convergent Decomposition Algorithms for Two-Stage Stochastic Pure Integer Programs</br><br>Author: Minjiao Zhang, The Ohio State University, 210 Baker Systems Building, 1971 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, zhang.769@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Simge Küçükyavuz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a class of two-stage stochastic pure integer programs with general integer variables in both stages and finitely many realizations of the uncertain data. Based on Benders' method, we propose decomposition algorithms with parametric Gomory cuts, and prove their finite convergence. We demonstrate our algorithms by examples, and present preliminary computational results.</br>
