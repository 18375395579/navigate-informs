<br>Title: Open Pit Mine Production Scheduling</br><br>Author: Alexandra Newman, Associate Professor, Colorado School of Mines, Division of Economics and Business, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, anewman@mines.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a model for open pit mine production scheduling in which we maximize net present value of the extracted blocks subject to production and processing constraints. We show how we are able to use variable elimination, cuts, and Lagrangian Relaxation to solve problem instances containing about 20,000 blocks and 6-10 time periods in minutes, whereas it is not possible for commercial software to obtain even a feasible solution for the monolith in days.</br>
