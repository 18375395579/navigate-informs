<br>Title: Integer Programming Techniques for the Branchwidth Problem</br><br>Author: Illya Hicks, Associate Professor, Rice University, Computational and Applied Mathematics, Houston, United States of America, ivhicks@rice.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cole Smith, Elif Ulusal</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Branch decompositions have been used in conjunction with dynamic programming techniques to solve some interesting problems in combinatorial optimization.  In contrast, the efficiency of these algorithms is contingent upon the width of the input branch decomposition.  Also, finding the branchwidth of a general graph or hypergraph is NP-hard.  This talk present integer programming formulations for the branchwidth problem along with some computational results.</br>
