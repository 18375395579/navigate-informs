<br>Title: On Local 1.5-Q-superlinear Convergence of the Primal-dual Exterior-point Method</br><br>Author: Igor Griva, George Mason University, 4400 University Dr, Fairfax, VA, United States of America, igriva@gmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roman Polyak</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a primal-dual exterior-point method (EPM) for optimization problems with both inequality and equality constraints. Every iteration the algorithms solves a primal-dual linear system of equations. We show that under the standard second-order optimality condition the EPM method generates a sequence, which converges to the primal-dual solution with an asymptotic 1.5-Q-superlinear rate.</br>
