<br>Title: Fully Sequential Procedures with Dormancy for Comparing Constrained Systems</br><br>Author: Christopher Healey, Doctoral Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, chealey@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seong-Hee Kim, Sigrun Andradottir</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present procedures for finding the best system satisfying a stochastic constraint.  Our approaches improve on other fully-sequential algorithms for solving such constrained comparison problems by halting sampling for systems found to be inferior to other systems until the feasibility of the superior systems is determined.  We provide results that show the validity of our procedures and savings over competing approaches.</br>
