<br>Title: Portfolio Optimization under Convex Incentive Schemes</br><br>Author: Maxim Bichuch, Princeton University, Dept of Operations Research and Finance, Sherrerd Hall, Charlton Street, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, mbichuch@princeton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stephan Sturm</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a utility maximization problem of terminal wealth from the point of view of a portfolio manager paid by convex incentives. Even though the manager's utility function is concave, the result is a non-concave optimization problem that does not fit into the classical portfolio optimization theory. Using duality theory, we prove existence and uniqueness of the optimal wealth in general (incomplete) markets.</br>
