<br>Title: From Cvar to Uncertainty Set: Implications in Joint Chance Constrained Optimization</br><br>Author: Melvyn Sim, Professor, NUS Business School, Singapore, dscsimm@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chung-Piaw Teo, Jie Sun, Wenqing Chen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we review the different tractable approximations of individual chance constraint problems using robust optimization on a varieties of uncertainty set, and show their interesting connections with bounds on the condition-value-at-risk CVaR. We also propose a new formulation for approximating joint chance constrained problems, which builds on a classical worst case bound for order statistics problem.</br>
