<br>Title: Ensemble Clustering Via Semidefinite Programming</br><br>Author: Jiming Peng, Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Dept. of Industrial & Enterprise Systems, 104 S. Mathews Ave., Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, pengj@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vikas Singh, Jinhui Xu, Lopamudra Mukherjee</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the ensemble clustering problem where the task is to agrregate multiple clustering solutions into a single one that maximizes the shared information among given clustering solutions. In this talk we first propose a new agreement measure based on 2D string encoding. We show that the maximization of the new agreement measure can be tranformed to the so-called 0-1 SDP, which can further be reduced to polynomial solvable SDP. Experiments based on the new measure will be reported.</br>
