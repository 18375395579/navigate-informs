<br>Title: Quasi-Newton Techniques for Nonlinear Optimization</br><br>Author: Long Hei, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States, lhei@ece.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jorge Nocedal</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: For large scale problems users cannot afford to operate the Hessian matrix, or sometimes are unwilling to invest effort to define it. Limited memory quasi-Newton methods are considered. It can be shown the quasi-Newton matrix overestimates the curvature along the eigenvectors corresponding to the small eigenvalues of the Hessian. We propose ideas on improving the convergence of quasi-Newton methods by incorporating spectral information into the algorithm.</br>
