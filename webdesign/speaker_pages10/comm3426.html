<br>Title: Identifying Optimal Designs in Competitive Facility Location and Design Problem</br><br>Author: Oded Berman, Professor, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S3E6, Canada, Berman@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Aboolian, Dmitry Krass</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We provide efficient solution methodology for single and multi-facility versions of the Competitive Facility Location and Design Problem. For uniform design model we develop an exact solution approach. Our methodology can be applied to develop optimal non-uniform designs for different budget level for use as inputs to a scenario-based model.</br>
