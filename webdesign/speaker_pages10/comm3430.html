<br>Title: Computing the Full Distribution of the Max of Two Gaussians Using Hybrid Bayesian Networks</br><br>Author: Prakash P. Shenoy, Distinguished Professor, University of Kansas School of Business, 1300 Sunnyside Avenue, Summerfield Hall, Lawrence, KS, 66045-7585, United States, pshenoy@ku.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Esma Nur Cinicioglu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe a procedure for computing the full distribution of the max of two Gaussians using hybrid Bayes nets. We represent the max of two Gaussians as a Bayesian network, convert it to a mixture of Gaussians Bayesian network, and use the Lauritzen-Jensen algorithm to compute the full distribution exactly.</br>
