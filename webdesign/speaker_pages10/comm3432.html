<br>Title: A Primal-Dual Active-Set Method for Convex Quadratic Optimization</br><br>Author: Frank Curtis, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, United States of America, frank.e.curtis@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zheng Han, Daniel Robinson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a primal-dual active-set method for convex quadratic optimization.  The method is based on that proposed for bound-constrained problems by Hintermueller, Ito, and Kunisch.  However, we have extended the ideas to handle general linear constraints.  In contrast to classical active-set methods, the method makes rapid changes in the active set.  Computational experiments show that even for large problems (>1000 variables), the method is able to converge in only a few (<100) iterations.</br>
