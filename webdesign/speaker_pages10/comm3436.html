<br>Title: Finding Equitable Convex Partitions and Resource Allocation Applications</br><br>Author: Benjamin Armbruster, Stanford University, 121 W. Campus Dr. #1405A, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, armbruster@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yinyu Ye, John Carlsson</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by a multi-depot vehicle routing heuristic and other resource allocation problems, we look at the problem of equitably partitioning a convex polygon and a set of n points. We seek a partition of the polygon into n convex pieces of equal area, each containing one point. We demonstrate a new algorithm that finds an exact solution to our problem in O(Nn log N) time or arithmetic operations, where n is the number of points, m the number of vertices of the polygon, and N:=n+m the sum.</br>
