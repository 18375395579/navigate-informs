<br>Title: Robust System Reliability Design</br><br>Author: Jose Ramirez-Marquez, Assistant Professor, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, Jose.Ramirez-Marquez@stevens.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Recently developed bounding strategies that improve confidence interval estimation for system reliability  are used to provide a new reliability allocation perspective with the goal of developing a robust system reliability design. Research efforts have been focused : developing models for general series-parallel robust reliability analysis and, based on these models, generating heuristic methods for obtaining quasi optimal solutions to the best system design.</br>
