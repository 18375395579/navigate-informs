<br>Title: Long-term Planning for an Underground Mine</br><br>Author: Michel Gamache, Professor, Polytechnique Montréal, C.P. 6079 succ. Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC, H3C3A7, Canada, michel.gamache@polymtl.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean Collard</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this presentation, we will present a model of long-term planning for Raglan Mine, a large nickel mining complex in the Nunavik region at the extreme limit of Northern Quebec, Canada. We will discuss the mixed integer linear programming model and the constraints that are related to the various operating characteristics of this mine in the sub-Arctic Circle. Results of solutions will be presented.</br>
