<br>Title: The Maximum Visibility/Shortest Path Problem Applied to Routing of UAVs</br><br>Author: Eric Delmelle, Assistant Professor, University of Idaho, Department of Geography, McClure Hall 203, Moscow, ID, 83844, United States, delmelle@uidaho.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Irene Casas</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A bi-objective problem known as the maximum visibility/shortest path,   applied to routing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is presented. The   inputs are a network and an elevation model of the underlying terrain.   The network is constructed to reflect the terrain topography i.e.,   greater density where there is a strong variation in altitude. With the   built network, heuristic techniques are applied to solve the   bi-objective problem.</br>
