<br>Title: Nonlinear Optimization</br><br>Author: Andrzej Ruszczynski, Professor, Department of Management Science and Information Systems, Rutgers University, 94 Rockefeller Road, Piscataway, NJ, 00854, United States, rusz@business.rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The book covers convex analysis, optimality conditions, duality, and methods for solving unconstrained and constrained problems. It addresses modern topics such as optimality conditions and numerical methods for problems involving nondifferentiable functions, semidefinite programming, metric regularity and stability theory of set-constrained systems, and sensitivity analysis of optimization problems. All results are proved and illustrated by numerous examples and figures.</br>
