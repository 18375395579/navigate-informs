<br>Title: Double Oracle Algorithms for Game-Theoretic Resource Allocation</br><br>Author: Milind Tambe, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, tambe@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Manish Jain, Jason Tsai</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Many strategic actions carry a component beyond the immediate locale of the effort itself. To address the exponentially large strategy spaces that result, the RUGGED algorithm for road network domains uses best-response oracles and scales to real road networks of southern Mumbai. However, when contagion is present, computing best-responses is intractable. Thus, we extend RUGGED using heuristic oracles that enable it to scale to realistically sized leadership networks from counterinsurgency.</br>
