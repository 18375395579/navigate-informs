<br>Title: Weight Annealing Heuristics for Solving Bin Packing Problems</br><br>Author: Edward Wasil, Professor of Management Science, American University, Kogod School of Business, Washington, DC, 20016, United States, ewasil@american.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Golden, Kok-Hua Loh</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop heuristics that use weight annealing to solve one-dimensional and two-dimensional bin packing problems. Our heuristics are easy to understand and contain a small number of parameters. We apply our heuristics to well-known problem sets and find that they quickly produce high-quality solutions that are comparable to the best solutions found in the literature.</br>
