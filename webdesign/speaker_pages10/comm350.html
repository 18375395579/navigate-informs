<br>Title: Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization</br><br>Author: Juan Arrieta, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, jarrieta@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lorenz Biegler</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The optimal thrusting sequence that will transfer a spacecraft between two points in the Solar System can be obtained from the solution to a large, nonconvex optimal control problem. The NLP resulting from direct transcription is solved with IPOPT. We present realistic examples: an orbit transfer and an Earth-Moon trajectory.</br>
