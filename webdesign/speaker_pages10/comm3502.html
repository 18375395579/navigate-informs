<br>Title: Integer Programming Models for Tactical Harvest and Access Planning</br><br>Author: Evelyn Richards, Associate Professor, Faculty of Forestry and Environmental Management, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, E3B 6C2, Canada, evelyn.richards@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eldon Gunn</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The problem of scheduling clearcut harvests under adjacency constraints, simultaneous with road construction decisions, is addressed using a mixed integer optimization model. The model allows an unrestricted road network with multiple exit points. Computational results show that it is possible to solve models of practical size using a commercial solver.</br>
