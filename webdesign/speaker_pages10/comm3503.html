<br>Title: Partial Decomposition Strategies for Two Stage Stochastic Integer Programs</br><br>Author: Walter Rei, Professor, University of Quebec in Montreal, 315 St.Catherine Street East, Montreal, QC, H2X 3X2, Canada, rei.walter@uqam.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Mike Hewitt</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The L-Shaped algorithm, which is based on Benders decomposition, is readily used to solve stochastic optimization models.  However, to efficiently apply this method, one must overcome some of the drawbacks associated with the decomposition strategy.  One of these drawbacks is related to the lack of information in the master problem due to the relaxation of the optimality and feasibility cuts.  To address this problem, we propose a partial decomposition strategy that retains, throughout the solution process, part of the structure of the original model in the master problem.  The benefits associated to this strategy are numerically illustrated on stochastic network design problems.</br>
