<br>Title: Surrogate-Objective MIP Heuristics</br><br>Author: Jonathan Eckstein, Professor, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, RUTCOR Room 155, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, jeckstei@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Paul Watson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We describe a class of binary MIP heuristics that replace the original objective by a concave function that favors integrality, and seek a local minimum by a Frank-Wolfe procedure.  The well-known feasibility pump is one member of this class, but there are many others.  What are the best surrogate objectives to use?  How and when should their parameters be chosen or randomized?  How should one best escape fractional local minima?</br>
