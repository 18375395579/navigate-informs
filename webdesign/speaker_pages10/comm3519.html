<br>Title: Convex Extensions, Inclusion Certificates and Disjunctive Programming</br><br>Author: Mohit Tawarmalani, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, School of Management, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, mtawarma@purdue.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We define inclusion certificate based on convex multipliers required to assert the inclusion of a point in the convex hull of a disjunctive set. The inclusion certificates are shown to be related to the product-factors used in relaxation schemes such as Lift-and-Project and the Reformulation Linearization Techniques. Insights into relaxation hierarchies are developed.</br>
