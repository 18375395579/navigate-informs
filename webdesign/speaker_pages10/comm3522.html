<br>Title: Directed Random Graphs with Given Degree Distributions</br><br>Author: Ningyuan Chen, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, 321 S. W. Mudd Building, 500 W. 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, nc2462@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mariana Olvera-Cravioto</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose an algorithm to generate directed random graphs with prescribed degree distributions F and G. By the algorithm the in- and out-degree sequences we draw converge to i.i.d. random variables of F and G as the number of nodes grows to infinity, though the equal sum restriction is imposed. We show that by repeatedly generating the graph or erasing self-loops and extra multiple edges, the procedure results in a simple graph without significantly affecting the degree distributions.</br>
