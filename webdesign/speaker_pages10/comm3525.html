<br>Title: Strong: A Response-surface-based Algorithm in Simulation Optimization</br><br>Author: Hong Wan, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, United States, hwan@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kuohao Chang, Jeff Hong</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a metamodel-based optimization method that has been used widely in simulation optimization. However, the method is not automated and does not have convergence guarantee. This paper propose STRONG algorithm that takes a similar framework as RSM but solves these two problems traditional RSM has. Combining with appropriate experimental designs, STRONG has the potential of handling high-dimensional problems efficiently.</br>
