<br>Title: The Value Function of a Mixed-integer Linear Program (MILP) with a Single Constraint</br><br>Author: Menal Guzelsoy, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Ave, Room 362, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, megb@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The value function of a MILP is a function that returns the optimal solution value as a function of the right-hand-side. In this work, we analyze the structure of the value function of a MILP with a single constraint. Using subadditive duality, we show that all the information necessary to construct the value function can be obtained by examining the structure in a neighborhood of the origin. We propose a  new method for extending the function from such a neighborhood to the entire real line.</br>
