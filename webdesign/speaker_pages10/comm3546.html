<br>Title: Solution Methods for Pre-positioning of Emergency Supplies Under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Mark Turnquist, Cornell University, mat14@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Carmen Rawls</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe two solution algorithms for a two-stage stochastic optimization model that determines locations and quantities of emergency supplies to be pre-positioned in anticipation of potential natural disasters ?an exact method based on the L-shaped method for integer stochastic programs and a heuristic based on an approximation method for the second-stage objective function. The solution quality and computational effort are compared in a case study based on the southeastern U.S.</br>
