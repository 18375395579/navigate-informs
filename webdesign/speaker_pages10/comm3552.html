<br>Title: Bounds on the Expected Payments of Insurance Instruments: A Novel Computational approach</br><br>Author: Robert Howley, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Harold S Mohler Lab, Bethlehem, PA, 18015-1582, roh210@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Luis Zuluaga, Robert Storer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: It has been shown that single random variable semiparametric bounds can be solved using semidefinite programming (SDP). While the SDP approach was the foundation of many important advances in the literature, it has practical limitations. Here, we develop a method that uses standard optimization techniques, such as linear and first-order nonlinear programming. We also show that our approach allows the inclusion of extra information about the random variable (e.g., unimodality) in a simple way.</br>
