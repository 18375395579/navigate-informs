<br>Title: Matrix-free Solvers for Systems of Inclusions</br><br>Author: Hao Wang, ISE, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Ave., Room 371, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, haw309@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Burke, Frank Curtis, Jiashan Wang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Matrix free alternating direction and reweighting methods are proposed for solving systems of inclusions.  The methods attain global convergence guarantees under mild assumptions.  Emphasis is placed on their ability to rapidly find good approximate solutions, and to handle large-scale problems.  Numerical results are presented for elastic QP subproblems arising in NLP algorithms.</br>
