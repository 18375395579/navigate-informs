<br>Title: An SDP-Based Branch and Bound Code for the Maximum Independent Set  Problem</br><br>Author: Brian Borchers, Professor, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, 801 Leroy Place, Socorro, NM, 87801, United States, borchers@nmt.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a branch and bound code for maximum independent set problems that uses semidefinite programming bounds. The SDP bound is much tighter than linear programming bounds and computational results show that this approach can outperform conventional integer linear programming approaches. Results are presented for several large instances arising from coding theory.</br>
