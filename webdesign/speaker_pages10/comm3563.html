<br>Title: On the Stability of a Boundedly Rational Day-to-day Dynamic</br><br>Author: Xuan Di, Graduate Asistant, University of Minnesota, 500 Pillsbury Dr SE, Civil Engineering, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, dixuan@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jong-Shi Pang, Henry Liu, Jeff Ban</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper provides the stability analysis for the boundedly rational day-to-day dynamic. TBR dynamic is a variable structure system consisting of multiple subsystems. Within each subsystem, the dynamic is linear time-invariant with exponential stability. Along the discontinuity surfaces between subsystems, the dynamic will slide along it and stabilize at one equilibrium. Therefore, the BR dynamic is asymptotic stable. A small network example is given to illustrate the stability analysis.</br>
