<br>Title: Computing Certificates for Integer Programs</br><br>Author: Ojas Parekh, Senior Member Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, MS 1326, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States of America, odparek@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cynthia Phillips, Robert Carr, Harvey Greenberg</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A certificate for a computation is data that allows an independent program to verify that its output is correct.  A canonical example is the primal/dual certificate for a linear program, requiring only two matrix evaluations to prove the optimality of any solution.  A certificate for an IP branch-and-bound computation must prove that each branching operation, added cut, and fathoming operation is correct. We will discuss what this entails in the context of PICO, our massively parallel IP solver.</br>
