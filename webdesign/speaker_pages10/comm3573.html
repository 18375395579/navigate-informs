<br>Title: Making Dark Shadows with Linear Programming</br><br>Author: Robert Vanderbei, Professor, Princeton University, E-226 E-Quad, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States of America, rvdb@Princeton.EDU</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A leading concept for NASA's upcoming planet-finding telescope involves placing an occulter 70,000 km in front of a 4m telescope.  The purpose of the occulter is to block the bright starlight thereby enabling the telescope to image planets orbiting the blocked star.  But, diffraction effects prevent a simple circular occulter from providing a fully dark shadow---a  specially shaped occulter is required.  I will explain how this shape-optimization problem can be solved with linear programming.</br>
