<br>Title: A Novel Approach for Solving Disjoint Bilinear Programming Problems</br><br>Author: Churlzu Lim, UNC Charlotte, 9201 University City Blvd, Charlotte, NC, United States of America, clim2@uncc.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a new solution approach for solving disjoint bilinear programming problems having two distinctive sets of constraints. The method exploits optimality conditions at a vertex of the polytope defined by one set of constraints, and can be implemented as a stand-alone procedure while potentially enhanced by conventional cutting planes. We report preliminary computational results for solving test instances generated from different applications of disjoint bilinear programming.</br>
