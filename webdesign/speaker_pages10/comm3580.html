<br>Title: On a Class of Nonlinear Bilevel Knapsack Problems</br><br>Author: Behdad Beheshti, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, bek42@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oleg Prokopyev, Osman Ozaltin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a bilevel knapsack problem where the leader's objective is in a nonlinear form. We discuss related theoretical computational complexity issues. We also present an exact enumeration approach based on a specialized branch-and-backtrack algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on a large number of instances.</br>
