<br>Title: A Complementarity Framework for Forward Contracting under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, Asst. Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 216 Transportation Bldg, Urbana, Il, 61822, United States of America, udaybag@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gerd Infanger, Peter W. Glynn</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider an instance of a stochastic multi-leader multi-follower equilibrium problem.  By conjecturing a relationship between forward and spot decisions, we may use complementarity theory to provide an existence result.  We present a scalable algorithm for solving the resulting stochastic complementarity problem by using matrix-splitting techniques. Tests show that the effort grows linearly with the number of scenarios. The model is applied to a two-settlement 6-node electricity market.</br>
