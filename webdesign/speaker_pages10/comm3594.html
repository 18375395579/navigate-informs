<br>Title: A Fractional Programming Approach to Determine the Independence Number of a Graph</br><br>Author: Jitamitra Desai, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, United States of America, jdesai@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Baski Balasundaram, Ruken Duzgun</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we present a continuous optimization approach to determine the independence number of a graph via a fractional programming formulation. Previously known properties are utilized in developing two new global optimization algorithms to determine the independence number of a graph. Computational results that show the efficacy of these approaches and comparisons to other bounds on the independence number are also provided.</br>
