<br>Title: A Decision Analysis Approach to Solving the Signaling Game</br><br>Author: Barry Cobb, Associate Professor, Virginia Military Institute, 335 Scott Shipp Hall, Lexington, VA, 24018, United States of America, cobbbr@vmi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Atin Basu Choudhary</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The decision analysis approach of van Binsbergen and Marx (2007) for determining Nash equilibria in extensive-form games is compared to a modified approach that models mixed strategies as decision tree chance nodes.  This modified approach is compared to a traditional game-theoretic approach for solving the asymmetric signaling game.</br>
