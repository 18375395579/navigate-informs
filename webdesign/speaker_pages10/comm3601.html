<br>Title: MIR Inequalities, Mixed Integer Knapsack Problems and the Closure of Single-row Systems: Part II</br><br>Author: Marcos Goycoolea, Universidad Adolfo Ibañez, Santiago, Chile, marcos.goycoolea@uai.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ricardo Fukasawa, William Cook</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we focus on a key component of the exact separation algorithm for single row systems: an LP based branch-and-bound algorithm for solving mixed integer knapsack problems. The main feature of this algorithm is that it exploits cost and lexicographic dominance in order to significantly improve solution times. We compare the algorithm performance with CPLEX and discuss possible extensions of the approach.</br>
