<br>Title: Extensions to an Optimization Services Instance Language</br><br>Author: Robert Fourer, Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States, 4er@iems.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jun Ma, Kipp Martin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Optimization problems of interest today go beyond the traditional linear, integer, quadratic, and smooth nonlinear types. A language for problem instances must be extended accordingly. This presentation describes prospective extensions to OSiL, our proposed language standard, in such areas as combinatorial optimization and constraint programming, stochastic programming, and semidefinite and cone programming.</br>
