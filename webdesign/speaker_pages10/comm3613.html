<br>Title: Developing Applications Based on CHiPPS</br><br>Author: Yan Xu, SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC, 27519, United States of America, Yan.Xu@sas.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs, Laszlo Ladanyi, Matthew Saltzman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: CHiPPS is the COIN-OR Open Parallel Search Framework, a framework for implementing parallel algorithms based on tree search. The current CHiPPS architecture consists of three layers: ALPS, BiCePS and BLIS.  In this talk, first we briefly introduce the main concepts of CHiPPS, then we use VRP/TSP as an example to show how to develop specific applicatoins based on CHiPPS.</br>
