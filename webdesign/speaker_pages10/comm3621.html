<br>Title: Valid Inequalities for Some Generalizations of the Continuous Mixing Set</br><br>Author: Manish Bansal, PhD Student, Texas A&M University, Emerging Technologies Building,, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77840, United States of America, bans1571@neo.tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kiavash Kianfar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present our progress in studying some interesting generalizations of the continuous mixing set previously studied by Van Vyve (2005). We present new valid inequalities for these sets and discuss their facet-defining properties.</br>
