<br>Title: Data Aggregation Method for A Covering Problem with Gradual Coverage</br><br>Author: Hoon Jang, KAIST, 335 Gwahangno, Yuseong gu, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of, hoon.jang@kaist.ac.kr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Taesik Lee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a data aggregation method for covering location problem. There exists an aggregation method that reduces data without causing errors. It was developed for covering problem with 0-1 type coverage, and we generalize the method to apply to gradual coverage covering problem. We approximate a gradual coverage function into a step-wise function using K-means algorithm, and a common reachability set is constructed accordingly. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</br>
