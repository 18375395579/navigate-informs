<br>Title: Motivations, Models and Algorithms for Scheduling with Multitasking</br><br>Author: Nicholas G. Hall, Ohio State University, 2100 Neil Avenue, 658 Fisher Hall, Columbus, OH, 43210-1144, United States of America, hall_33@fisher.osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chung-Lun Li, Joseph Y.-T. Leung</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider scheduling environments with multitasking. We study how the motivation for multitasking affects how multitasking influences a simple scheduling system. For each motivation, we study the solvability of three of the most widely studied and practical classical scheduling problems. We provide a fast optimal algorithm or an intractability result. For the latter case, we describe simple heuristic approaches and demonstrate computationally that they provide close to optimal solutions.</br>
