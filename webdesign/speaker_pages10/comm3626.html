<br>Title: An Adaptive Augmented Lagrangian Method</br><br>Author: Daniel Robinson, Johns Hopkins University, 100 Whitehead Hall, 3400 N. Charles Street, Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States of America, daniel.p.robinson@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hao Jiang, Frank Curtis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a method for solving constrained optimization problems based on the augmented Lagrangian.  In contrast to traditional augmented Lagrangian methods that slowly update multiplier estimates and an associated penalty parameter, our method updates both during each iteration.  A strength of our method is the ability to approximately solve each subproblem and to efficiently update the penalty parameter to promote fast local convergence.  Preliminary numerical results will be presented.</br>
