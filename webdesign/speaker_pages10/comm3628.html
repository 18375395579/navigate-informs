<br>Title: Analysis of a Branch-and-Price Decomposition for the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem with General</br><br>Author: Elif Ilke Gokce, Texas A&M University, TAMUS 3131, College Station, TX, 777843-313, United States, elifg@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wilbert Wilhelm</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the bounds that might be obtained from a branch-and-price decomposition of the multi-dimensional knapsack problem with generalized upper bound constraints.  It evaluates alternative decompositions and implementation tactics, assessing the trade off between the tightness of resulting bounds and the run time required to obtain them.</br>
