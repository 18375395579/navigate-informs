<br>Title: Using Column Generation to Solve Spatially Explicit Forest Management</br><br>Author: Marc McDill, Associate Professor of Forest Management, Penn State School of Forest Resources, 310 Forest Resources Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, mem14@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Babu Rajasekaran</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Column generation is a promising method for obtaining near-optimal solutions for large spatially-explicit forest harvest scheduling models.  We test a column generation approach with 40 hypothetical problems and 2 methods of generating initial solutions to the sub-problems(seeds).  For each method and subproblem, 25, 50 and 100 seeds were generated.  Our tests show that both the seed generation method and number of seeds significantly influence solution time and quality of the final solution.</br>
