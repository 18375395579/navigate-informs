<br>Title: Computational Advances for Generating Hypergraphic Cutting Planes</br><br>Author: Siddhartha Maheshwary, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Center for OR in Medicine, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States, sid@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eva K. Lee</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: New cutting planes are derived from conflict hypergraphs arising out of 0-1 integer programs (every vertex of the conflict hypergraph corresponds to a 0-1 variable, and every edge corresponds to a cover in the constraint matrix). Hypergraphic forms of structures such as odd holes, cliques etc. are identified. Separation heuristics are developed. Applications to MIP instances from brachytherapy cancer treatment are presented.</br>
