<br>Title: Relaxations for Stochastic Unit Commitment</br><br>Author: John Birge, University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, john.birge@chicagobooth.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mihai Anitescu, Cosmin Petra</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic unit commitment problems can be modeled as stochastic mixed-integer programs but these models can easily become intractable.  This talk will discuss relaxations in which binary decisions are interpreted as probabilities and constraints are placed on variance.</br>
