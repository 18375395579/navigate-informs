<br>Title: Solution Approaches for Integer Bilevel Programs</br><br>Author: Scott Denegre, Lehigh University, 200 W. Packer Avenue, Mohler Laboratory, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, scd3@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ted Ralphs</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider novel solution approaches for integer bilevel programs (IBPs). Extensions to polyhedral techniques developed for IPs are derived and new classes of valid inequalities are introduced, leading to a branch-and-cut algorithm. Particular emphasis is placed on integer interdiction problems, a subclass of IBPs and a natural extension of the network interdiction problem. Multiobjective programming techniques are used to analyze the tradeoff between resources and interdiction effort success.</br>
