<br>Title: A Primal Barrier Function Phase I Algorithm for Nonsymmetric Conic Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Yasuaki Matsukawa, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennnoudai, Tsukuba, Ib, 305-8573, Japan, matsuk50@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Akiko Yoshise</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We call the set of positive semidefinite matrices whose elements are nonnegative the doubly nonnegative (DNN) cone. Using its symmetric cone representation, the authors showed that the DNN relaxation gives significantly tight bounds for a class of quadratic assignment problems while the computational time is too long. Motivated by the observations, we propose a nonsymmetric primal barrier function Phase I algorithm and provide a sufficient condition for finite termination.</br>
