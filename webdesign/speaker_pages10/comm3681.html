<br>Title: A Genetic Algorithm for Scheduling Groups of Jobs on Parallel Machines to Minimize Total Tardiness</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Schaller, Professor, Eastern Connecticut State University, Department of Business Administration, 83 Windham Streeet, Willimantic, CT, 06226, United States of America, schallerj@easternct.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of scheduling on parallel machines with family setup times to minimize total tardiness. A new genetic algorith proposed. This algorithm is compared to tabu search procedures by testing them on randomly generated problems. The results of the test reveal that improved solutions can be obtained by using the genetic algorithm.</br>
