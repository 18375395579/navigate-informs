<br>Title: Using Java Applets to Teach Linear Programming</br><br>Author: Robert Vanderbei, Professor, Princeton University, ORFE, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, rvdb@princeton.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Associated with my book Linear Programming, which is freely available online in pdf format, there are several Java applets. These applets illustrate several variants of the simplex method, the network simplex method, and interior point methods. Some are designed to illustrate and others are intended as online exercises. I will demonstrate several of these applets and illustrate how they are integrated with the online version of the textbook.</br>
