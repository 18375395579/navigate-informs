<br>Title: Efficient Algorithms for Assessing Contiguity and Holes in Political Districting</br><br>Author: Douglas King, PhD Candidate, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Industrial and Enterprise Systems Eng., Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, kingdouglasm@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Sewell, Sheldon Jacobson, Wendy Cho</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Political districting is an intractable problem with significant  ramifications for political representation. This problem can be formulated as a graph partitioning problem; satisfying contiguity  constraints can require significant computation as the problem size  grows. This talk discusses a scale-invariant algorithm for enforcing  contiguity in local search approaches to political districting.</br>
