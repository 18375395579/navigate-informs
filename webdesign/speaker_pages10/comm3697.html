<br>Title: Solving Large, Unstructured Problems with Benders Decomposition</br><br>Author: Tony Tarvin, PhD Candidate, Colorado School of Mines, 1500 Illinois Street, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, dtarvin@mymail.mines.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexandra Newman, Kevin Wood</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Benders decomposition (BD) is typically applied to solve linear programs (LPs) or mixed-integer programs (MIPs) with special structure.  We show that BD can help solve large, unstructured LPs, MIPs and even integer programs (IPs).  Computational results show order-of-magnitude speedups on a variety of problems, including instances from anomaly detection, crew scheduling, mining, and multi-dimensional packing.</br>
