<br>Title: Structural Symmetry Breaking Restarted</br><br>Author: Meinolf Sellmann, Assistant Professor, Brown University, 115 Waterman Street, PO Box 1910, Providence, RI, 02912, United States, sello@cs.brown.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Heller</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We wish to assess how symmetry breaking and restarts interact with one another. We find that the improvements to be gained by restarting are far smaller for full symmetry breaking methods than those that can be obtained for methods that break only some symmetries or none at all. Surprisingly, the combination of restarts and breaking value symmetry only is often competitive with complete symmetry breaking.</br>
