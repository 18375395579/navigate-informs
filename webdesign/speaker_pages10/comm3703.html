<br>Title: Information Relaxation and Dual Formulation of Controlled Markov Diffusions</br><br>Author: Enlu Zhou, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 201D Transportation Bldg., 104 S.

We extend this dual formulation to controlled Markov diffusions: in a similar way we  relax the constraint of adapted policy and impose penalty on early access of the future information. We establish the weak and strong duality, and complementary slackness results. We explore the structure of the optimal penalties  and expose its connection between MDPs and controlled Markov diffusions.</br>
