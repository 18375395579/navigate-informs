<br>Title: Bootstrapping to Reduce Bias in Stochastic Linear Programs</br><br>Author: Doug Thomas, Smeal College of Business, 463 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, dthomas@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Linderoth, Udom Janjarassuk, Dr. Russell Barton</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Using the sample average approximation method for solving a stochastic LP results in a biased estimate of the optimal objective value.  In this research, we investigate the use of bootstrapping to reduce this bias.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of using bootstrapping to reduce this bias on a set of test problems.</br>
