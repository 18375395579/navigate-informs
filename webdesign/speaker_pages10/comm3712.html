<br>Title: Direct Spatial Management of Old Growth Forest Using a Bevers-Hof Linear Programming Approach</br><br>Author: Eldon Gunn, Professor, Dept. of Industrial Engineering, Dalhousie University, PO Box 1000, Halifax, NS, B3J2X4, Canada, eldon.gunn@dal.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Bevers and Hof pioneered the approach of direct linear programming manipulation of the spatial features of the forest.  This paper illustrates the use of that approach to manipulate the amount and connectivity of old growth forest on an actual forest landscape with more than 10,000 stands. The resulting linear programming problems are large but easily solvable.</br>
