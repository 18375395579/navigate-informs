<br>Title: Combining Quasi-Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube Methods in Stochastic Optimization</br><br>Author: Tito Homem-de-Mello, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd M235, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, tito@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shane Drew</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We discuss the use of non-i.i.d. sampling methods when solving stochastic optimization problems by sample average approximations. We focus on two well known techniques --- quasi-Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube sampling. We study algorithms that combine these two approaches, and discuss some properties of the resulting estimators. We present numerical results illustrating the behavior of the algorithms for a collection of problems.</br>
