<br>Title: The Sensor Selection Problem for Bounded Uncertainty Sensing Models</br><br>Author: Volkan Isler, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street, Lally 207, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, isler@cs.rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ruzena Bajcsy</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We address the problem of selecting sensors so as to minimize the error in estimating the position of a target. In our model, the measurements are polygonal, convex subsets of the plane which are merged by intersecting corresponding subsets. After presenting an approximation algorithm which guarantees that the resulting error is within factor 2 of the least possible error, we conclude the talk with an overview of recent results for related sensor management problems.</br>
