<br>Title: A Conservative Approximation Approach to the Value-at-risk Minimization</br><br>Author: Jun-ya Gotoh, Chuo University, 1-13-27 Kasuga, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 112-8551, Japan, jgoto@indsys.chuo-u.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuichi Takano</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a conservative approximation approach to the VaR minimization problem when the underlying loss distribution is given by a finite number of scenarios. The proposed approach is formulated as a D.C. optimization problem, and a branch-and-bound global optimization algorithm is presented. Some comparative computational results are given, showing characteristics of the algorithms.</br>
