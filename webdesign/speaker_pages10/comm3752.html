<br>Title: Recent Applications of the Multi-start Global Optimization Algorithm MSNLP</br><br>Author: Leon Lasdon, University of Texas, Austin, TX, Leon.Lasdon@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zsolt Ugray, John Plummer, Michael Bussieck</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The multi-start global optimization algorithm MSNLP starts a local NLP solver from a filtered subset of points generated by a starting point generator or “driver.?Recent improvements include dynamic distance and merit filters and stochastic drivers as alternatives to OptQuest. We describe some recent applications of this system to GAMS models of fixed-mix multiperiod investing and to fitting a waterflooding oilfield model to field data.</br>
