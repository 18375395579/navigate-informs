<br>Title: Robust Multi-armed Bandit Problems</br><br>Author: Michael Kim, Postdoctoral Fellow, University of California-Berkeley, /NUS Business School, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, kimmi@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Lim</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a robust formulation of the standard multi-armed bandit problem. We show that arms are no longer independent under the worst-case model, even if they are independent under the nominal. By adapting recent results from stochastic DP duality theory, we derive performance bounds for a robust version of the Gittins index policy. One general contribution of this work is that it provides methods for evaluating the performance of policies of interest in a robust dynamic optimization setting.</br>
