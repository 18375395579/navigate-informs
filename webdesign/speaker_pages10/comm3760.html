<br>Title: Continuous and Discontinuous Extreme Inequalities for Infinite Group Problem</br><br>Author: Santanu Dey, School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, sdey@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yanjun Li, Lisa Miller, Jean-Philippe Richard</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop new tools to prove that inequalities are extreme for infinite group problems. These are used to show that integer infinite group problems have discontinuous extreme inequalities, giving insight into unusual types of cuts that may be computationally important. We present connections between finite and infinite group problems and give results about converging sequence of extreme inequalities. Finally, we prove that extreme inequalities for mixed integer programs are always continuous.</br>
