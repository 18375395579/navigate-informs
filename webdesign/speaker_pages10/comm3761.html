<br>Title: Finite-domain Cuts for the Linear Arrangement Problem</br><br>Author: John Hooker, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, jh38@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cid de Souza, Alexandre Freire</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Integer programming models provide no useful polyhedral bounds for the linear arrangement problem and the closely related minimum bandwidth problem, due to the difficulty of giving the problem a 0-1 formulation. We therefore propose a constraint-programming style finite-domain model of the problem in which the variables are edge labels.  We study the associated polyhedron and investigate experimentally some bounds based on cuts derived from this polyhedron.</br>
