<br>Title: A Network Approach to a Geometric Packing Problem</br><br>Author: Brad Paynter, Assistant Professor of Mathematics, University of Central Oklahoma, 100 N. University Dr., Box 129, Edmond, OK, 73034, United States of America, bradpaynter@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Douglas Shier</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate a geometric packing problem (derived from an industrial setting) that involves fitting patterns of regularly spaced disks in the plane without overlap. We derive conditions for achieving the feasible placement of a given set of patterns and discuss related optimization problems. An associated network representation allows one to characterize all feasible solutions and to design heuristic algorithms for this provably difficult problem. Computational experience is also presented.</br>
