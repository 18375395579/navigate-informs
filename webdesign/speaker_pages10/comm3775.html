<br>Title: Distributed Optimization in Stochastic Networks</br><br>Author: Ilan Lobel, 77 Massachusetts avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, lobel@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Asu Ozdaglar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of computing distributedly the minimum of a sum of non-smooth convex functions in a network where communication links fail according to a stochastic process. We show that a consensus-based algorithm coupled with a subgradient method converges to the optimal for i.i.d. stochastic networks and in networks where communication probability is dependent on the optimization solution.</br>
