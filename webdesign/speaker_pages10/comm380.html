<br>Title: Separation and the Stable-Set Polytope</br><br>Author: Illya Hicks, Associate Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial and Systems Engineering MS 3131, Zachry Engineering Center, College Station, TX, 77843-3131, United States, ivhicks@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sandeep Sachdeva, Benjamin McClosky</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A k-separation of a graph G is a pair of edge disjoint subgraphs whose union of nodes and edges form G and whose intersection of vertices has order k. We offer preliminary research for a facet generation procedure for the well-studied stable set polytope of a graph G that contains a 3-separation. The procedure is based upon the composition of polyhedra corresponding to two subgraphs of G related to a 3-separation of G. This work is based upon the earlier work of Barahona and Mahjoub.</br>
