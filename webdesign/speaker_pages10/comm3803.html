<br>Title: Dealing with Multi-Objectives in Optimization-Based Master Production Scheduling(MPS)</br><br>Author: Zhenying Zhao, Intel Corporation, 5000 W. Chandler Boulevard, Chandler, AZ, United States, zhenying.zhao@intel.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Optimization-based MPS outperforms traditional heuristic approaches due to its capability to consider complex constraints and solution optimality. In this paper, a stochastic mixed integer programming (MIP) model is presented for a generic multi-plant MPS problem. Two major issues regarding MPS are discussed: 1) Handling demand uncertainty with scenario-based stochastic programming formulation; 2) Dealing with multiple objectives with sequential solve execution.</br>
