<br>Title: Reformulation based Global Optimization of Nonconvex MINLP Problems</br><br>Author: Andreas Lundell, Post doc researcher, Åbo Akademi University, Biskopsgatan 8, TURKU, 20500, Finland, andreas.lundell@abo.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tapio Westerlund</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this presentation, a method for solving nonconvex MINLP problems is described. Instead of applying a branch-and-bound strategy, reformulation techniques are utilized to obtain convex overestimations of nonconvex problems in an extended variable-space. A sequence of these problems is solved to obtain the global solution. For nonconvex twice-differentiable functions, a quadratic spline underestimator is used. The result is an easily-implementable algorithm solving a very general problem class.</br>
