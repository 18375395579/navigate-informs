<br>Title: A Comparison of Optimization Modeling Software for Python</br><br>Author: Bjarni Kristjansson, President, Maximal Software, Inc., 933 N. Kenmore Street, Suite 218, Arlington, VA, 22201, United States of America, bjarni@maximalsoftware.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sandip Pindoria</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We start with a quick overview, to demonstrate the many features of Python that make it good language for optimization and scientific computing, comparing it with other programming languages such as C/C++, Java and C#. Then we demonstrate a few examples of how to build and deploy optimization applications, using some of the component libraries currently available in Python, such as MPLPY, GUROBI, CPLEX, GAMS, LPSolve, PYOMO, and PULP-OR, while pointing out the main differences between them.</br>
