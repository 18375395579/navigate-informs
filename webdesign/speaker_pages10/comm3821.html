<br>Title: Decomposition and High Throughput Solution of Equilibrium Problems</br><br>Author: Michael Ferris, Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1210 W. Dayton Street, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, ferris@cs.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Rutherford</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Decomposition approaches enable solution of otherwise intractable mathematical programming problems.  We describe a decomposition approach for large scale complementarity problems arising from applied general equilibrium problems in economic analysis. We report on their solution using a variety of distributed algorithms in combination with the grid extensions of GAMS, the (high throughput) distributed computational resources of Condor and the PATH solver.</br>
