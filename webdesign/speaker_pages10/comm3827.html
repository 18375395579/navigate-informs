<br>Title: Positioning Mobile Agents to Decontaminate a Graph</br><br>Author: John Penuel, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States of America, jpenuel@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): J. Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of using mobile agents to decontaminate a graph. We model the problem as a two-stage MIP. In the first stage, we position agents. In the second stage, we determine the fastest cleaning strategy (we show this is NP-hard). Previous literature focuses on the minimum number of agents required to clean the graph. We focus on how quickly the graph can be cleaned. We give formulations and propose a method to optimally position agents so to minimize average cleaning time.</br>
