<br>Title: A Regularized Interior-Point Method for Semidefinite Programming</br><br>Author: Ahad Dehghani, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, ahad.dehghani@mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Louis Goffin, Dominique Orban</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Interior-point methods in semi-definite programming (SDP) require the solution of a sequence of linear systems which are used to derive the search directions. Safeguards are typically required in order to handle rank-deficient Jacobians and free variables. We propose a primal-dual regularization to the original SDP and show that it is possible to recover an optimal solution of the original SDP via inaccurate solves of a sequence of regularized SDPs for both the NT and dual HKM directions.</br>
