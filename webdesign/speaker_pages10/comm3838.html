<br>Title: DAKOTA: A Toolkit for Engineering Design</br><br>Author: William Hart, Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, Sandia National Laboratories, Mail Stop 1110, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM, 87185-1110, United States, wehart@sandia.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Eldred, Anthony Giunta</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We summarize capabilities and applications of the DAKOTA toolkit for high performance computers.  It provides a flexible interface between simulation software and algorithms for optimization, uncertainty quantification, parameter estimation, design of experiments, and sensitivity analysis.  DAKOTA enables research in multilevel parallel computing, mixed integer nonlinear programming, surrogate-based optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and simultaneous analysis and design.</br>
