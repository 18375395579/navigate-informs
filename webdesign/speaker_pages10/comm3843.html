<br>Title: A Computational Study of Linear and Integer Optimization with Multiple-Choice Restrictions</br><br>Author: Ernee Kozyreff, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States of America, ernee.kozyreff@ttu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ismael de Farias, Ming Zhao</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A wide variety of applications require that certain variables have value zero in a feasible solution when other specific variables are nonzero. Such constraints are called multiple-choice. We present new inequalities for solving multiple-choice optimization through branch-and-cut, and an extensive computational experience that reveals new and surprising facts about these problems, their formulations, and the cutting planes.</br>
