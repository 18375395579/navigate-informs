<br>Title: Message-Passing Algorithms for Optimization</br><br>Author: Ciamac Moallemi, Graduate Student, Stanford University, Department of Electrical Engineering, Packard 274, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, ciamac@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Van Roy</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A nonserial dynamic program is an optimization problem with an objective that decomposes according to a graphical structure. Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in message-passing algorithms for the solution of such problems, however these methods are still poorly understood and have received little attention in the OR community. We will present such an algorithm in several settings and discuss convergence results.</br>
