<br>Title: Cost Function Approximation Methods in Dynamic Programming</br><br>Author: Huizhen Yu, Postdoctoral Researcher, Univ. of Helsinki, P.O. Box 68 (Gustaf Hallstromin Katu 2b), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, 00014, Finland, janey.yu@cs.helsinki.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dimitri Bertsekas</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We overview approximate dynamic programming methods, which are suitable for very large-dimensional problems. The cost function is approximated by simulation and projection on a low-dimensional subspace generated by basis functions. Recent extensions involving Q-learning algorithms for optimal stopping problems, and general linear systems of fixed-point equations will also be discussed.</br>
