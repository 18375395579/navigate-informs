<br>Title: Multiobjetive Optimization of the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP)</br><br>Author: Diana Ramirez, Chief Science Officer, FCIMEC, Carrera 53 No.74-86 Office 402, Barranquilla, At, 080020, Colombia, dramirez@fcimec.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fernando Gonzalez, Andres Palmieri, Libardo Gomez, Miguel Jimenez, Esneyder Gonzalez, Fabio Monroy</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: RCPSP under multiple objectives is considered in this research, where both cost and time need to be minimized. The mathematical formulation and metaheuristic solution approach based on bacteria fototaxis is presented in this paper. The functions to be minimized are makespan and resource investment cost. A case study presented in a construction company demonstrates the need for multi-objective optimization as a support for decision making.</br>
