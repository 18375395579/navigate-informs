<br>Title: The Cunningham-Geelen Method in Practice: Branch-decompositions and Integer Programming</br><br>Author: Susan Margulies, Research Associate, Pennsylvania State University, 318 McAllister Hall, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, margulies@math.psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Illya Hicks, Jing Ma</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Cunningham and Geelen (2007) describe an algorithm for solving the integer program max{c^Tx : Ax = b, x >= 0}, which utilizes a branch-decomposition of the matrix A and techniques from dynamic programming. We report on the first implementation of the CG algorithm, and demonstrate that certain infeasible knapsacks instances with width <= 6 run in a matter of minutes with the CG algorithm, but in a matter of hours with the commercial integer programming software Gurobi.</br>
