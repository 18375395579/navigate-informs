<br>Title: Valid Inequalities for MIPs and Group Polyhedra from Approximate Liftings</br><br>Author: Lisa Miller, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street SE, 1100 Mechanical Engineering, Minneapolis, MN, 55113, United States, lmiller@me.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean-Philippe Richard, Yanjun Li</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present an approximate lifting scheme to derive valid inequalities for general mixed integer programs and for the group problem. This scheme uses superadditive functions as the building block of integer and continuous lifting procedures. It yields an alternate simple derivation of new as well as known families of cuts that correspond to faces, and sometimes facets, of the group polyhedron.</br>
