<br>Title: New Facets of the (Directed) Cycle Polytope</br><br>Author: Egon Balas, Professor, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, eb17@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ruediger Stephan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Earlier work on the directed cycle polytope P showed how to lift and project facets of the asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (ATSP) into facets of P. Here we introduce a different class of facets, unrelated to the ATS polytope, whose support spans the entire digraph and whose defining inequality is tight for every two-cycle.</br>
