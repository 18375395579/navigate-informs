<br>Title: Branching Techniques for MINLP</br><br>Author: Pietro Belotti, Tepper S. of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, belotti@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Francois Margot, Jon Lee, Andreas Waechter</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Non-convex constraints are very common in reformulation techniques for MINLP and can be handled by partitioning the solution space. We study several branching techniques in a branch&bound algorithm for non-convex MINLP problems; these techniques naturally extend from solvers for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming. We compare them with classical branching strategies used in Global Optimization software.</br>
