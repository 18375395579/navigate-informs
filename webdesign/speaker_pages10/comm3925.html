<br>Title: A Branch-and-cut Algorithm for Optimization with First-order Stochastic Dominance constraints</br><br>Author: James Luedtke, IBM Research, jrluedt1@wisc.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving stochastic programs with first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) constraints. The algorithm enforces the non-convex FSD constraint through branching, and hence requires no binary variables. This enables the use of an existing cutting plane method for solving the second-order dominance relaxation to yield bounds. The key challenge we address is how to adapt this relaxation to the constraints imposed by branching.</br>
