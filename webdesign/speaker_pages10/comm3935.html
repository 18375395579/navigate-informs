<br>Title: A Fast Heuristic Method for Global Optimization and MINLP</br><br>Author: John Chinneck, Professor, Carleton University, Systems and Computer Engineering, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, On, K1S 5B6, Canada, chinneck@sce.carleton.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mubashsharul Shafique</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Our multi-start heuristic for global nonlinear optimization has these steps: random initial points, rapid movement towards feasibility, clustering the near-feasible points to identify disjoint feasible regions, a simple heuristic for improving the best point in each cluster, and a local optimizer. The method is parallelizable, well-suited to very large models, and fast. It is extended to MINLP by adding spatial and integer branching to return a solution using very few local optimizer launches.</br>
