<br>Title: Deception Tactics for Network Interdiction: A Multi-Objective Approach</br><br>Author: Javier Salmerón, Associate Professor, Naval Postgraduate School, jsalmero@nps.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This work develops defender-attacker network interdiction models with deception, i.e., where the defender is allowed to use interdiction assets and decoys that are not realized by the attacker. We develop a mixed-integer programming formulation as a generalized network, and its Benders decomposition. We also show a multi-objective extension to accommodate several attacker behaviors.  Our computational tests show the difficulty in solving these problems optimally.</br>
