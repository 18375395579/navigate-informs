<br>Title: On the Global Solution of Linear Programs with Linear Complementarity Constraints</br><br>Author: John E. Mitchell, Professor, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 Eighth St. AE325, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, mitchj@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jong-Shi Pang, Kristin P. Bennett, Gautam Kunapuli, Jing Hu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This talk presents a parameter-free integer-programming based algorithm for the global resolution of a linear program with linear complementarity constraints (LPEC). The cornerstone of the algorithm is a minimax integer program formulation that characterizes and provides certificates for the three outcomes---infeasibility, unboundedness, or solvability---of an LPEC. Computational results demonstrate that the algorithm can handle infeasible, unbounded, and solvable LPECs effectively.</br>
