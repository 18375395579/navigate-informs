<br>Title: An Approximate Solution Method for Large Risk-Averse Markov Decision Processes</br><br>Author: Dharmashankar Subramanian, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown, NY, 10598, United States of America, dharmash@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marek Petrik</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Stochastic domains often involve decision makers that are risk averse. We propose and analyze a method for solving large risk-averse MDPs with hybrid continuous-discrete state spaces and continuous action spaces. The proposed method iteratively improves a bound on the value function using the linearity structure of the MDP. We demonstrate the use of the method on a portfolio optimization problem.</br>
