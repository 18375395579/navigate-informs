<br>Title: Progressive Hedging approach for the stochastic index tracking problem</br><br>Author: Roy Kwon, Associate Professor, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Rd, Toronto, On, M5S 3G8, Canada, rkwon@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dexter Wu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We formulate the problem of following a benchmark index as a two sage stochastic mixed integer program. The model incorporates a wide range of trading constraints. A progressive hedging heuristic is presented that is shown to generate optimal or near optimal solutions is reasnable time. Comparisons are made with methods such as dual decomposition.</br>
