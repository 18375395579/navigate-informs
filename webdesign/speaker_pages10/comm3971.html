<br>Title: Systematic Local Search for Constraint Optimization</br><br>Author: Bill Havens, Simon Fraser University, School of Computing Science, Burnaby, BC, V5A1S6, Canada, havens@cs.sfu.ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We define a new search framework for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and constraint optimization problems (COPs). The frameworks suggests a multiplicity of new hybrid search methods which combine aspects of stochastic local search, systematic constructive (bactrack) search algorithms and nogood learning techniques. Recently we have shown significant progress in using this hybrid method for hard random CSPs, job shop and open shop scheduling problems.</br>
