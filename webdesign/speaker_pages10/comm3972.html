<br>Title: A Unified Theorem on SDP Rank Reduction</br><br>Author: Yinyu Ye, Professor, Stanford University, Dep. of Management Science & Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305-4026, United States, yinyu-ye@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a low--rank approximate solution to a system of linear equations in symmetric,   positive semidefinite matrices, where the approximation quality of a solution is measured by its maximum relative   deviation, both above and below, from the prescribed quantities. We present a randomized polynomial time algorithm to compute such a solution with provable bounds, and show such bounds are tight.</br>
