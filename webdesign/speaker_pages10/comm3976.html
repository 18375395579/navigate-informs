<br>Title: Efficient Algorithms for the  Maximum Clique Problem in Very Large Graphs</br><br>Author: Behnam Behdani, Industrial and Systems Engineering Department, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, behdani@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The maximum clique problem is one of the classical problems in graph theory with applications in many fields including computational neuroscience. In some applications, the underlying graph is very large which makes it extremely hard to find the maximum clique. Here we present an efficient algorithm for finding a near maximum clique in very large graphs.</br>
