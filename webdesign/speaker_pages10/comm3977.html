<br>Title: New Cutting Planes for Cardinality Constrained Optimization</br><br>Author: Ismael de Farias, Associate Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering, Texas Tech, Lubbock, TX, United States of America, defarias@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ming Zhao</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Cardinality constraints are pervasive in applications in fields as diverse as finance, bioinformatics, and data mining. We present a polyhedral study of such problems and new inequalities for use as cutting planes in LP-based branch-and-bound.</br>
