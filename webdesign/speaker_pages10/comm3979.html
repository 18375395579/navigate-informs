<br>Title: Generating All Maximal Feasible Binary Solutions to Monotone Systems</br><br>Author: Vladimir Gurvich, Visiting Professor, RUTCOR - Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States, gurvich@rutcor.rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Lawler, Lenstra and Rinnooy Kan (1980) showed that all maximal binary solutions of a knapsack problem can be efficiently generated, and conjectured that the same is not possible for multi-knapsack problems, unless P=NP. We show that in fact this generation problem can be solved efficiently, in some sense.</br>
