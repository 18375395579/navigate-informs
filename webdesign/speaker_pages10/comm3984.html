<br>Title: Conic Relaxations and Valid Inequalities for the Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow Problem</br><br>Author: Chen Chen, PhD Student, University of California, Berkeley, 450 Sutardja Dai Hall #61, Berkeley, CA, 94708, United States of America, chenchen@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard O'Neill, Alper Atamturk, Shmuel Oren</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop valid inequalities for the AC Optimal Power Flow problem (ACOPF). It is a nonconvex generation dispatch problem that on certain instances can be solved with the Lagrangian dual. This dual can be cast as a Semidefinite Program (SDP) and hence polynomial-time optimization algorithms apply. Our inequalities are used  in a cutting plane algorithm to approximate SDP. On IEEE test cases we are able to take a copper-plate model or branch-based relaxation and converge to the dual solution.</br>
