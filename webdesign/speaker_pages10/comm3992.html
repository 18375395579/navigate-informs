<br>Title: An Integrality Gap Minimization Algorithm for Binary Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming</br><br>Author: Wendel Melo, Visiting Scholar, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States of America, wendelalexandre@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fernanda Raupp, Marcia Fampa</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This work presents a new algorithm for binary Mixed Integer Nonlinear  Programming (MINLP) problems based on the idea of minimizing the  integrality gap. To improve feasible solutions, a sequence of convex and  nonconvex nonlinear programming subproblems is solved. Computational  experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm can find feasible  solutions of the original problem very fast, showing a promising  feasibility heuristic.</br>
