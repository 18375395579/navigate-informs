<br>Title: Stochastic First- and Zeroth-order Methods for Nonconvex Stochastic Programming</br><br>Author: Guanghui Lan, University of Florida, P.O. Box 210020, Gainesville, FL, 32603, United States of America, glan@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Saeed Ghadimi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a new stochastic approximation type algorithm, namely the randomized stochastic gradient method, for solving a class of nonlinear (possibly nonconvex) stochastic programming problems.   We establish the rate of convergence of the method for computing an approximate stationary point of a nonlinear programming problem. This method is then specialized for solving a class of simulation-based  optimization problems in which only stochastic zeroth-order information is available.</br>
