<br>Title: A New Integrality Gap for the Semidefinite Relaxation of Sparsest Cut</br><br>Author: Assaf Naor, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052-6399, United States, anaor@microsoft.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this talk I will show that the Heisenberg group has an equivalent metric which is in squared L_2, yet it does not embed into L_1. It follows that the classical Heisenberg geometry on R^3 is a simple counter example to the Goemans-Linial conjecture on the integrality gap of the semidefinite relaxation of the Sparsest Cut Problem.    Based on joint work with James R. Lee</br>
