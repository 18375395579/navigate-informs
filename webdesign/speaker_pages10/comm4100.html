<br>Title: Resource Based Path Dependency and Risk Aversion</br><br>Author: Janne Kettunen, Assistant Professor, Haskayne School of Business, 2500 University Drive N.W., Calgary, AB, Canada, jskettun@ucalgary.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Derek Bunn</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We provide reasons for the origin of firm's resource based heterogeneity. Given heterogeneous existing resources, we show that it is optimal for a firm with hedgeable existing assets to signal that it is more risk averse. Also, we show that steps toward asset diversification are path dependent as a function of time. For policy makers, our results suggest that if resource based path dependency is not considered policy impacts can be significantly different than what expected.</br>
