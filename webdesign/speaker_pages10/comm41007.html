<br>Title: Sensitivity Analyses for Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Alexander Dessanti, Systems Analyst, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800-1188, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States of America, adessan@sandia.gov</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Given the complex nature of multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems, it is important to determine where decision makers should focus their effort and resources.  To address this issue, this study examines techniques for determining which input parameters in a MOCO problem have the greatest impact on the resulting optimal trade space.  In this case, the trade space represents a set of optimal combat vehicle designs with respect to five dimensions of stakeholder value.</br>
