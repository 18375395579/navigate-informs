<br>Title: Emergency Supplies Inventory Planning Before the Hurricane Season</br><br>Author: Selda Taskin, Auburn University, taskise@auburn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Emmett Lodree, Jr.</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a stochastic inventory model with Bayesian forecast updates that is relevant to determining inventory levels for emergency supplies that will potentially be consumed during the hurricane season. The model addresses the trade-off between forecast accuracy and cost efficiency over time and integrates evolving hurricane predictions into the decision process.</br>
