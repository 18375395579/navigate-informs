<br>Title: A Stochastic Dynamic Programming Model for Co-optimization of Distributed Storage</br><br>Author: Xiaomin Xi, The Ohio State University, 210 Baker System Building, 1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH, 43220, United States of America, xi.12@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ramteen Sioshansi, Vincenzo Marano</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a stochastic dynamic programming model that co-optimizes the use of energy storage for multiple applications, such as energy, capacity, and backup services, while accounting for market and system uncertainty. Using the example of a used battery from a plug-in electric vehicle that has been remanufactured and installed in a home as a distributed storage device, we demonstrate the ability of the model, and show that secondary uses of PEV batteries can provide substantive value.</br>
