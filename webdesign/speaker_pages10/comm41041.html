<br>Title: A Sustainable Capacity Expansion Model in Competitive Power Markets</br><br>Author: Chung-Li Tseng, Associate Professor, University of Missouri-Rolla, Department of Engineering Management, Rolla, MO, 65409, United States, chungli@umr.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper addresses the capacity expansion process of generation and transmission under competition.  A planning model is proposed for the Regional Transmission Organization, from a long-term and system-wide perspective, to achieve sustainable capacity expansion. The development cycle of the power market is formulated mathematically as a dynamic system.  Sustainable equilibrium of the capacity expansion process will be defined and obtained through some numerical examples.</br>
