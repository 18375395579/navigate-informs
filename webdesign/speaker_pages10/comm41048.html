<br>Title: Optimal Harvesting Policies to Control Batch-to-batch Variability in Bioreactors</br><br>Author: Tugce Martagan, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1550 Engineering Drive, Engineering Cent, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, martagan@wisc.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Controlling batch-to-batch variability presents a significant challenge in biomanufacturing processes. In this paper, we model upstream biomanufacturing operations using Markov Decision Process model, and identify optimum harvesting policies to minimize expected cost in the presence of batch-to-batch variability. We subsequently assess the robustness of these policies to manufacturing uncertainties.</br>
