<br>Title: Solving MPEC Problems for Electricity Markets Using Disjunctive Constraints and Linearization</br><br>Author: Florian Leuthold, Dresden University of Technology, Chair of Energy Economics, Dresden, 01062, Germany, Florian.Leuthold@tu-dresden.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steve Gabriel</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical formulation in order to solve a Stackelberg game for a network constrained electricity market. We assume that there is one strategic player. The resulting MPEC is reformulated as MIP by using disjunctive constraints and by parameterizing the output decision of the strategic player. We report computational results for a stylized Western European grid with realistic data assigning market power to the French company EDF.</br>
