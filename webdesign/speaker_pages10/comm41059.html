<br>Title: Using Weather Insurance to Manage Default Risk for Small Farmers</br><br>Author: Candace Yano, Professor, UC Berkeley, IEOR Dept. and Haas School of Bus., Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, yano@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Frank (Youhua) Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Mitigating risk for small farmers in developing countries is extremely difficult.  Crop insurance is available to large farmers, but post-season payouts require a loss assessment, which is too expensive to implement in the case of small farms. We present an approach for combining typical seasonal farm loans with weather insurance and show how to best structure these arrangements to mitigate risk for the lender and farmer.</br>
