<br>Title: Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programming Approach to Asset and Liability Management</br><br>Author: Stephen Stoyan, PhD Student, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, stoyan@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roy Kwon</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present the problem of Asset and Liability Management (ALM) where the underlying portfolio contains an index-tracking fund.  A general ALM model is defined whose assets meet a terminal financial obligation while upholding a number of important portfolio characteristics.  The numerous sources of uncertainty are captured in a Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programming (SMIP) approach, where a Goal Programming technique is used to handle various portfolio objectives.</br>
