<br>Title: Modeling for Equitable Food Distribution in North Carolina under Capacity Constraints</br><br>Author: Irem Sengul, North Carolina State University, 2101 Hillsborough St, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, isengul@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Julie S. Ivy, Reha Uzsoy</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We model the trade-off between equity and effectiveness with respect to the distribution of food donations in a specific region under capacity constraints. We work with the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina which serves as a hub and branch for distributing food to four branches in a 34-county service area. This presentation focuses on deterministic, capacity-constrained network flow models for this problem and the effect of distribution capacities on the optimal policy.</br>
