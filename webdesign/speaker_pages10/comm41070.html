<br>Title: A General Framework for Enterprise Level Distributed Decision Making</br><br>Author: Datta Kulkarni, General Motors Corporation, Manufacturing Systems Research Lab, 30500 Mound Road, Warren, MI, 48090, United States, datta.kulkarni@gm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Tew, Edward Hanawalt</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a general framework for an enterprise level business decision model involving multiple stakeholders. The model enables trade offs through revenue and risk contributions. The revenue contribution is evaluated through cost structure analysis using Net Present Value. The risk contribution is evaluated employing the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The structured decision framework allows the multiple stakeholders to negotiate effectively to drive optimal enterprise level business decisions.</br>
