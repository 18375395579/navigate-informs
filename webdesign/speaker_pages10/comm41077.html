<br>Title: Generic Simulation Model for Assembly Line Supply</br><br>Author: Veronique Limere, Post-doctoral researcher, Ghent University, Technologiepark 903, Zwijnaarde, 9052, Belgium, Veronique.Limere@UGent.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kurt De Cock, El-Houssaine Aghezzaf</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A simulation model for materials supply to mixed-model assembly lines will be discussed. The simulation model is created in FlexSim by means of an automatic model generator and demonstrates the in-plant logistical flows involved to supply parts from the warehouse to the assembly line. The results of the simulation model are compared to those of a deterministic mixed integer linear programming model. The findings of this study will be reported.</br>
