<br>Title: A Modeling Framework for Airlines Competition Analysis: Application to the US Domestic Markets</br><br>Author: Ahmed Hassan, Student, Southern Methodist University, 12516 Audelia Rd # 1908, Dallas, TX, 75245, United States of America, aehassan@engr.smu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Khaled Abdelghany, Ahmed Abdelghany</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present an equilibrium-based modeling framework for airlines competition analysis at the network level.  The framework considers primary factors including demand levels, infrastructure capacity, and airlines resources.  The problem formulation and an efficient solution algorithm are described. The results illustrating the framework application in the US domestic markets are presented.</br>
