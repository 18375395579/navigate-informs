<br>Title: Game-theoretic Approaches for Complex Systems Optimization</br><br>Author: Shih-Fen Cheng, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 80 Stamford Road, 178902, Singapore, sfcheng@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, two optimal decision-making problems in the context of automotive industry are presented. The first problem deals with the complex operational problem of shutting down a serial production line so as to achieve a desirable state. The proposed method significantly outperforms prevalent ad hoc procedures. The second problem deals with the complexity of making joint decisions within a large manufacturing corporation. A game-theoretic decomposition scheme is proposed and it's shown to have a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness.</br>
