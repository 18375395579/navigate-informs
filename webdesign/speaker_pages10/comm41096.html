<br>Title: Determining the Traffic State Under Tradable Energy Quotas (TEQs): Dynamic User Equilibrium Model with Path Based Cell Transmission Model</br><br>Author: H. M. Abdul Aziz, Ph.D. Candidate, Purdue University, 150 Arnold Dr. Apt. 15, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, haziz@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Satish Ukkusuri</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research analyzes the change in route choice behavior and accordingly the transportation planning process after the implementation of Tradable Energy Quotas (TEQs). TEQs is a widely studied personal carbon trading (PCT) scheme aiming at cutting down GHG emission and fossil fuel consumption. We develop mathematical models to determine traffic state under dynamic user equilibrium behavior where each user minimizes carbon credit consumption (to maintain the energy quota) in addition to travel time.</br>
