<br>Title: Greenhouse Gas Stabilization Scenarios from the Climate Change Science Program</br><br>Author: Leon Clarke, Senior Research Economist, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, 8400 Baltimore Avenue, Suite 201, College Park, MD, 20817, United States of America, leon.clarke@pnl.gov</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Consideration of optimal long-term policy to address climate change requires models that link the socioeconomic and technological drivers of greenhouse gas emissions with key elements of the Earth system. This paper provides an overview of recent stabilization scenarios conducted by three integrated assessment modeling teams for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program. The scenarios explore the emissions, energy, and economic implications of alternative greenhouse gas stabilization levels.</br>
