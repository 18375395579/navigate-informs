<br>Title: Analysis of Border Crossing Stations</br><br>Author: Katsunobu Sasanuma, PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, katz@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Hampshire, Alan Scheller-Wolf</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Border-crossing stations are often modeled using two connected birth-death Markov chains. However, the performance analysis of a model of border-crossing stations is complicated. We propose a new method to analyze such connected Markov chains. The method enables us to decompose Markov chains into basic sub-chains and makes our analysis simpler.</br>
