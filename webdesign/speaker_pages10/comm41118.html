<br>Title: Average Cost Based Power Contracts Can Mitigate Carbon Leakage</br><br>Author: Yves Smeers, Professor, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 34 Voie du Roman Pays, Louvain la Neuve, 1348, Belgium, smeers@core.ucl.ac.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Giorgia Oggioni</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Electricity intensive industries have responded to the introduction of the EU-ETS by asking for special power contracts whereby they would be supplied from dedicated power capacities at average (capacity, fuel, transmission and emission allowance) cost. We model this situation on a prototype power system calibrated on four countries and show that this can constitute a partial remedy to their treat of leaving the EU to environmentally more tolerant countries</br>
