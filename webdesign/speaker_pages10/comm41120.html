<br>Title: Analysis of the Effect of Technology Distribution on the Water Requirements for Energy Generation</br><br>Author: Erica Stults, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 100 Institute Rd., Worcester, MA, 01609, United States of America, estults@wpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Trapp, John Bergendahl, Isa Bar-On</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Thermoelectric power generation uses approximately 50 percent of the water withdrawn in the US. We explore the replacement of existing power generation plants in Texas by alternative energy technologies, with a focus on solar and wind, and its effect on water withdrawal and/or consumption. We show how the replacement of traditional thermoelectric generation technologies with renewable solar and wind technologies can reduce future water demands for power generation.</br>
