<br>Title: An Optimal Resource Allocation Model Aging for Bus Transit Fleet Based on Service Life and Budget Constraint</br><br>Author: Sushant Sharma, Purdue University, NEXTRANS, 3000 Kent Avenue, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, sharma57@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sabyasachee Mishra</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: An optimization model for allocation of funds among different fleet improvement programs within budget constraints over the planning period is presented. This is achieved by minimizing the Net Present Cost of the investment within the constraint of remaining life of the fleet. The model formulation and application are demonstrated with a real world case study of transit agencies</br>
