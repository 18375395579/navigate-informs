<br>Title: The EU’s Climate and Energy Package- An Assessment with a Hybrid CGE Model</br><br>Author: Niels Anger, Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) Environmental and Resource Economics, Environmental Management P.O. Box 10 34 43, Mannheim, Germany, anger@zew.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andreas Löschel, Ulf Moslener</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We summarize the main elements of the European Commission’s proposal to implement the ambitious carbon dioxide reduction targets until 2020. We then quantitatively analyse the proposal using a hybrid CGE model where we implemented the carbon dioxide reduction targets, the auctioning rules and the redistribution mechanisms. The simulation analysis shows carbon prices, welfare implications of the proposal on a member state level and sectoral competitiveness impacts.</br>
