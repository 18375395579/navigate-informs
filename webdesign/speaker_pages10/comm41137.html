<br>Title: Analysis of the Combined Use of Pumped Hydro Storage with a Kenyan Wind Farm: Stochastic DP Approach</br><br>Author: C. Lindsay Anderson, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, 320 Riley Robb Hall, Ithaca, United States of America, cla28@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maureen Murage</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) project, the largest wind farm in East Africa is to be completed in 2016 and will contribute to 16% of the total generation installed capacity in Kenya. In this study we investigate the benefits of operating the LTWP in conjunction with pumped hydro storage. This includes the development of a stochastic dynamic programming model. This model seeks the optimal control strategy of wind energy combined with storage by maximizing the wind farm’s expected revenue.</br>
