<br>Title: Affine Policies and Constraint Generation for the Multistage Adaptive Robust Unit Commitment Problem</br><br>Author: Alvaro Lorca, Operations Research PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, alvarolorca@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andy Sun</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The uncertain nature of multiple factors such as wind power generation and electricity demand makes the operation of power systems highly challenging. In this talk we present a multistage adaptive robust approach for the unit commitment problem under uncertain net electricity demands. We consider families of approximate affine policies for dealing with this hard problem and a solution method based on constraint generation with several algorithmic improvements.</br>
