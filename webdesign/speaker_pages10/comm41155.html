<br>Title: Two-level Mixed Integer Programming for Energy Conservation Measure Selection</br><br>Author: Bill Champion, Director/Ph.D. Candidate, EMG Corporation, University of Maryland, 222 Schilling Circle Suite 275, Hunt Valley, MD, 21031, United States of America, bchampion@emgcorp.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven Gabriel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many states, local governments and authorities have been issued directives and mandates that require a percentage reduction in energy consumption. Project selection is made difficult given real-world constraints, limited resources to implement savings retrofits, various suppliers in the market and other project financing alternatives.  This paper will demonstrate how two-level mixed integer programming is used to optimize the selection of energy conservation measures.</br>
