<br>Title: Using a Supply Function Equilibrium to Predict Carbon Emissions</br><br>Author: Eddie Anderson, Professor, University of Sydney, Faculty of Economics and Business, Sydney, Australia, E.Anderson@econ.usyd.edu.au</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper makes use of recent work on the characteristics of supply function equilibrium and effective methods to calculate these, given the generator cost functions. A supply function equilibrium may not fully reflect generator bids in practice, but it does give some guidance on likely behaviors. Using a supply function equilibrium calculation we will look at the way in which carbon emissions change as the carbon price increases in a situation in which gas and coal generators are competing.</br>
