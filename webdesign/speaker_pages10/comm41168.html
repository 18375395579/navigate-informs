<br>Title: Mitigating Real Time Price Uncertainty Induced by Wind Power through Stochastic Unit Commitment</br><br>Author: Anthony Papavasiliou, University of California at Berkeley, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, IEOR Department, Berkeley, CA, 94720-1777, United States of America, anthony.papavasiliou@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yi He, Alva Svoboda</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Wind power supply uncertainty introduces significant uncertainties in day-ahead trading due to its impact on real-time electricity prices. In particular, in the day ahead market utilities face the challenge of self-commitment, self-scheduling and cycling decisions on slow units. We present a stochastic unit commitment model and solution methodology for addressing these challenges and demonstrate savings relative to current practice which is based on deterministic models.</br>
