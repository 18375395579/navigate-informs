<br>Title: Natural Gas Price Forecasting via Selective Support Vector Regression</br><br>Author: Mohammad H. Poursaeidi, University of Houston, E 209 Engineering Building, Houston, TX, United States of America, mhpoursaeidi@uh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erhun Kundakcioglu, Andrea Viacaba</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Natural gas is one of the most abundant sources of energy in the US. An accurate natural gas price prediction model is useful in the industry due to its economical impacts. The purpose of this research is to analyze historical information on the variables that potentially have a high impact on the supply and demand for natural gas, as well as the price. This analysis is conducted using a novel data-mining algorithm that is capable of simultaneously removing noise and performing regression.</br>
