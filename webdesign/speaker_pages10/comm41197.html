<br>Title: Manufacturer Lease Pricing and Adverse Selection</br><br>Author: Lamar Pierce, Assistant Professor of Strategy, Washington University in St. Louis, One Brookings Drive, Box 1133, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States of America, PIERCE@WUSTL.EDU</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper uses one million car lease transactions to identify how car manufacturers use lease buyback prices to address problems of adverse selection in the secondary market. We isolate the effects of lease subsidization and adverse selection while controlling for the importance of factory warranties. This paper is the first to use micro-level data to test theories of leasing as a solution to adverse selection.</br>
