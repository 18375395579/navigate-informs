<br>Title: Capacity Choice under Demand Uncertainty: Postponement Effects on Product Flexibility</br><br>Author: Dipankar Bose, Doctoral Student, Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Diamond Harbour Road , Joka, Kolkata, WB, 700104, India, dbose.iimc@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ashis Kumar Chatterjee</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop two-stage stochastic programme to study the economics of price and production postponement decisions on dedicated versus product-flexible plant in context of capacity planning. Assuming demand intercept follows multivariate normal distribution, for three-product-case we analyze variance, correlation and cross-price effects. Due to analytical intractability, simulated-data based optimization is used.</br>
