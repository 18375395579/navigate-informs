<br>Title: Power Generation Expansion Planning with Short-term Demand Response</br><br>Author: Timo Lohmann, Colorado School of Mines, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, tlohmann@mines.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steffen Rebennack</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Demand response is the capability of load to react to short-term changes in electricity prices. As electricity markets become deregulated, it plays an increasingly important role. We present a long-term power generation expansion planning model with a short-term demand response function in its general form, and introduce a Benders Decomposition approach to solve it efficiently. We discuss possible extensions to the model and compare implementation options in GAMS.</br>
