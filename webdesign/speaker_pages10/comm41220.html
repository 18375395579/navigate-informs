<br>Title: Hope, Dread, Disappointment, and Elation from Anticipation in Decision Making</br><br>Author: Ying He, PhD Candidate, The University of Texas at Austin, 2110 Speedway Stop B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, ying.he@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Butler, James Dyer</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a model to incorporate both anticipation and disappointment into decision making, which captures the trade-off between a utility gain from higher anticipation and a utility loss from higher disappointment. The model is used to explore how optimistic attitude could mediate the wealth effect on risk attitude. We show that our model can explain the coexistence of a demand for gambling and insurance and provides unique insights into portfolio choice and advertising decision problems.</br>
