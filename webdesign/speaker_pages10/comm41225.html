<br>Title: Tradeoffs in Portfolio Management System Design</br><br>Author: Phil Beccue, Baxter BioScience, Phil_Beccue@Baxter.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chris Dalton</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: R&D portfolio management is about tradeoffs -- how do we select the set of projects that best meets our objectives given the constraints on our resources. Crafting a portfolio management system also involves tradeoffs.  We discuss how Baxter BioScience made difficult tradeoffs in designing and implementing its new portfolio management system, and how other objectives might lead to different choices.</br>
