<br>Title: Decision Support for Selecting the Future Medical Evacuation Aircraft</br><br>Author: Lawrence V. Fulton, Assistant Professor, Texas State University, 601 University Drive, San Marcos, TX, 78666, United States of America, lf25@txstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nathaniel D. Bastian</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We demonstrate the use of stochastic optimization in providing cost effectiveness analysis for selection of the military's future, in-theater aeromedical evacuation vehicle.  Given the uncertain nature of future conflict, evaluating trade-offs over multiple scenarios is of increasing importance to decision-makers. To demonstrate the utility of optimization, we provide an analysis of current and emerging technology over scenarios that have varying risk and complexity.</br>
