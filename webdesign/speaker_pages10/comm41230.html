<br>Title: Disruption Risk Modeling and Mitigation in Outsourcing</br><br>Author: Ufuk Bilsel, PhD Student, Penn State University, 215 W. Fairmount Ave #514, State College, PA, 16801, United States of America, rub150@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): A. Ravi Ravindran</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This research presents a risk quantification framework based on extreme value distributions. Risks are divided into several components which are first independently quantified and then aggregated. We use this framework to quantify disruption risks and include the risk value as an objective to minimize in a multicriteria mathematical model. The model determines primary suppliers and order allocations as well as backup suppliers in a multiple product ?multiple supplier supply chain.</br>
