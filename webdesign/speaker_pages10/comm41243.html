<br>Title: Carbon Constrained Supply Chain Network Design under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Mohammad Marufuzzaman, Research Assistant, Mississippi State University, PO BOX 9542, Industrial and Systems, Engineering Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, 39762, United States of America, maruf237@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sandra Eksioglu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This study shows the impact of different carbon regulatory policies on the design and management of a biofuel supply chain network in an uncertain environment. A two stage stochastic programming model is proposed for this problem. The model is solved using a modified L-shaped algorithm.</br>
