<br>Title: Inventory Control and Risk Management of Natural Gas Storage Assets</br><br>Author: Owen Wu, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, owenwu@bus.umich.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Managing a natural gas storage asset involves optimizing injection and withdrawal of natural gas and managing the risk using futures.

We study the structure of the optimal inventory control and trading strategy.</br>
