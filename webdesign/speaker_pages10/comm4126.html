<br>Title: Operational Hedging and Diversification under Exogenous Supply Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Fabian Sting, WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management, Fabian.Sting@whu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Arnd Huchzermeier</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: When facing supply risk caused by exogenous factors such as adverse weather conditions, firms diversify their supply to not “hold all eggs in one basket?
