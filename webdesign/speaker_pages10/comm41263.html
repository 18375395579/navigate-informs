<br>Title: A Wealth Risk Management Framework to Achieve Protective and Aspirational Objectives</br><br>Author: Aparna Gupta, Assistant Professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street, Troy, NY, 12180, United States, guptaa@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhisheng Li</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper formulates a wealth allocation framework to achieve downside wealth protection as well as an upside potential of affluence. Three risk dimensions are identified from the perspective of individual investors -- protective, market and aspirational -- and available assets are classified into these based on their risk-return profiles. All risk dimensions are optimized simultaneously through appropriate allocation of total wealth in the three asset groups.</br>
