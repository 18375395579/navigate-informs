<br>Title: The Valuation of Natural Gas-fired Power Plants by Integrating Sspark Spread and Weather Options</br><br>Author: Reaz-us Salam Elias, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada, m3elias@ryerson.ca</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Spark spread based valuation of a natural gas-fired power plant addresses only the price risks emerging from the uncertainties of natural gas and electricity prices. A power plant, however, is also exposed to weather related risks. If the winter is mild, lower electricity generation leads to lower profit. Temperature fluctuations affect the profitability of the plant. In order to hedge the downside profitability, power plants can transfer weather related risks using temperature-based weather options. This research focuses on the integration of spark spread options with weather options in valuing a natural gas-fired power plant in a real options framework. This study addresses the financial risk issues of a natural gas-fired power plant and determines whether it is viable to integrate weather options with spark spread options; and how many options to long or short to minimize the variance of the total profit.</br>
