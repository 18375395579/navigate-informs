<br>Title: Minimum Uplift Assignment of Transmission Expansion Costs to Beneficiaries</br><br>Author: Ross Baldick, Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station Stop C0803 ENS 502, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, baldick@ece.utexas.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In coming years, electric transmission networks will likely be expanded at an unprecedented rate to accommodate growth in renewables. In this work, we use a dual of the integer optimization problem of expanding transmission in order to set prices that “cover?as much of the total expansion cost as possible using linear prices. The remaining cost, due to the duality gap, could be socialized.  Basic theory and several small examples will be developed.</br>
