<br>Title: Stochastic Policy Modeling of Wind Energy Benefits</br><br>Author: Jeremy Hargreaves, Ph.D. Student, The Johns Hopkins University, DoGEE, 313 Ames, 3400 No. Charles St., Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States of America, jjh@jhu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sebastiaan Hers, Benjamin Hobbs</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Wind energy displaces fossil fuels and lowers emissions, but increases the volatility of net demand on thermal facilities.  To quantify wind’s net benefits for policy analysis purposes, we propose a stochastic optimization model to simulate balancing energy requirements and day-ahead commitments of generators, considering uncertainty in load and generation.  Markov chains are used to represent wind, load, and generator availability.  An application to the Netherlands energy market is presented.</br>
