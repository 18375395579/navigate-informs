<br>Title: Use of U.S. EPA MARKAL Model for Better Decision Making in Renewable Energy Alternatives</br><br>Author: Ozge Kaplan, US Environmental Protection Agency, 109 T.W.

A variety of renewable energy technologies for waste and landfill-gas are included in the U.S. EPA MARKAL model to understand how they compete against technologies using fossil fuels to meet the energy demands. The variation of cost, emissions, technology penetrations in different emission reduction scenarios, and the robustness of the technology choices are analyzed.</br>
