<br>Title: Optimization of Vaccine Packaging and Storage to Improve Vaccine Supply Chain Logistics</br><br>Author: Bryan Norman, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, banorman@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jayant Rajgopal, Shawn Brown, Jung Lim, Bruce Lee, Sunghoon Lim, Erin Claypool</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Cold storage space is a significant constraint in many vaccine supply chains.

Results are shown for different country contexts.</br>
