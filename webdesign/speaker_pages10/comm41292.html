<br>Title: Decommissioning and Repowering Decisions for Renewable Power Producers</br><br>Author: Chenlu Lou, Iowa State University, 3004 Black, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, clou@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): K. Jo Min</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: There have been substantial increases in the construction and operation of wind farms across the U.S.A. and the world, which will lead to a significant number of wind farm decommissioning and repowering decisions soon. We formulate and analyze mathematical models from a real options perspective with the operation and maintenance cost following the geometric Brownian motion process, and derive managerial insights for relevant government policy makers.</br>
