<br>Title: Land Acquisition and Restoration Strategies for Prairie-Obligate Butterfly Species</br><br>Author: Stephanie Snyder, USDA Forest Service, North Central Research Station, St. Paul, MN, United States, stephaniesnyder@fs.fed.us</br><br>Coauthor(s): James Miller, Adam Skibbe, Robert Haight</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a multi-objective land acquisition model to identify habitat protection and restoration strategies for prairie-obligate butterflies in suburban Chicago. Species' persistence depends upon the provision of grasslands and open wetlands in close proximity. Both protection and restoration of wetlands are considered. Buffering requirements for wetlands are explored using clique constraints.  Trade-offs between total area of protected habitat and distance to existing reserves are explored.</br>
