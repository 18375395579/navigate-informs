<br>Title: Generation Capacity Expansion in Electricity Markets under Rivalry and Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Michail Chronopoulos, University College London, Gower Street, London, United Kingdom, m.chronopoulos@ucl.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Derek Bunn, Bert De Reyck, Afzal Siddiqui</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We explore electricity capacity expansion by accounting for not only dependency between the cash flows of competing technologies but also competition. Although market equilibrium can be determined analytically in stylised real options models, in a more general setting with asymmetric costs and capacity restrictions, analytical solution of a system of equations is not possible. Since a convex programming approach cannot be implemented, complementarity problems provide a viable modelling approach.</br>
