<br>Title: Water Management: Optimal planning and allocation of renewable natural resource</br><br>Author: Karthik Murali, PhD Candidate, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 350 Wohlers Hall, Urbana, IL, 61820, United States of America, kmurali4@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Petruzzi, Michael Lim</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the optimal supply management problem for the manager of a renewable aquifer.  The manager must determine the optimal level of water transfers between municipalities and investment in water production technology. Using a stylized model, we determine the optimal policy for a profit or welfare-maximizing manager, and compare their impacts using the Triple Bottom Line framework. We obtain managerial insights and draw implications for policy related to sustainable water management.</br>
