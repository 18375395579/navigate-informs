<br>Title: Efficient Methods for Solving a Large-Scale Multistage Stochastic Program</br><br>Author: Sarah Ryan, Iowa State University, IA, United States of America, smryan@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yan Wang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We use a rolling two-stage procedure to solve a multistage stochastic program to assess the effects of uncertainties in fuel prices and demands on optimal energy flows in the U.S.  To avoid solving large deterministic equivalents, we investigate decomposition, sampling and scenario reduction methods that exploit both the generalized network structure of the optimization model and the multistage nature of forecast revision and uncertainty resolution.</br>
