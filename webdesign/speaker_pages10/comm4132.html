<br>Title: A Tradable Credit Scheme for Managing Morning Commute</br><br>Author: Nima Shirmohammadi, University of Florida, 365 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, nimashir@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin, Yu Nie</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we design and analyze a tradable credit scheme for managing bottleneck congestion in the morning commute. In the scheme, a traffic management authority allocates mobility credits to employers or firms in a central business district, and charges a certain number of credits for passing through a bottleneck between residential areas and the district. The employers or firms can distribute the allocated credits among their employees or trade them with other firms at a credit market.</br>
