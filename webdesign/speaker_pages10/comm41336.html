<br>Title: Comparative Assessment of Alternative Approaches to Distribution System  Design in Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Srinagesh Gavirneni, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, sg337@johnson.cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Poornachandra Panchalavarapu, Ram Rachamadugu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Conventional methods in designing distribution systems are sequential in nature ?strategic design of the distribution network followed by the operational design.  We propose an integrative approach which models and makes these decisions simultaneously.  Using a large practical data set from industry, we explore how product characteristics such as value density and demand variability impact the sequential approach vis-?vis the integrative approach.</br>
