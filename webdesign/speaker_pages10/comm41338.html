<br>Title: Multistage Stochastic Models for Natural Gas Contract and Maintenance Scheduling of Power Plants</br><br>Author: Qipeng Phil Zheng, Assistant Professor, University of Central Florida, Industrial Engineering & Mngmt Systems, Orlando, FL, 32816, United States of America, qipeng.zheng@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Due to environmental concerns and popularity of natural gas, more gas turbines will be introduced to power plants. This talk discusses multistage stochastic mixed integer models for natural gas contract and maintenance scheduling for power plants. Take-or-pay contract is modeled by reservoirs and the equipment maintenance is modeled by multistage mixed integer programs. Uncertainties are mainly from the volatile gas prices. Numerical experiments based on decomposition algorithms are shown.</br>
