<br>Title: Computation of Prices in Competitive, Dynamic Service Networks</br><br>Author: Terry Friesz, Harold and Inge Marcus Chaired Professor, Penn State University, 310 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, tlf13@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Changhyun Kwon, Matthew Rigdon</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this presentation we review a family of dynamic, game-theoretic models for pricing, resource allocation and demand management related to the provision of competitive services offered over networks. An algorithm based on gap functions is proposed and numerically tested.</br>
