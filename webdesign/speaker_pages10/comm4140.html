<br>Title: Worst-case Contingency-constrained Expansion Planning for Power Systems</br><br>Author: Neng Fan, Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 5800, MS 1326, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, United States of America, nnfan@sandia.gov</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we include the constraints of the N-k contingency into the planning process, such that the system can still run normally in case of contingencies with multiple simultaneous loss of the system elements. Robust optimization method is used to identify the worst-case contingency for analysis. In the operation level, the technique of line switching is added to check the benefits comparing with the situation without line switching.</br>
