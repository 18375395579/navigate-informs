<br>Title: Optimal Allocation of Defensive Resources in the Face of Intelligence about Atacker Preferences</br><br>Author: Chen Wang, University of Wisconsin Madison, 3237 Mechanical Engineering, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, cwang37@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vicki Bier</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a game in which an attacker chooses which target to attack according to a multi-attribute utility function.  The defender is uncertain about the attacker's weights on the various attributes.  We show how the defender can update her knowledge of the attacker's attribute weights in a Bayesian manner after each observed successful or attempted attack.</br>
