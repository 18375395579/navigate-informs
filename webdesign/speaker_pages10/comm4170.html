<br>Title: Modeling Alternative Energies</br><br>Author: Miguel Perez de Arce, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Cerro Lagunillas Oriente 6425. Peñalolen, Santiago, Chile, mfperezj@uc.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Enzo Sauma</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Energies such as geothermal, wind, among others, have been adopted by different countries as alternative energy to traditional sources, for which purpose different mechanisms are applied to its incorporation into the matrix of energy. In this paper we analyze some of the mechanisms with respect to their influence on the degree of penetration of alternative energy sources.</br>
