<br>Title: Discrete-time optimization of consumption and investment decisions under consumption constraints</br><br>Author: Amit Bhandari, PhD Candidate, Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences, Northwestern University, 2145 N. Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, amitb@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John R. Birge</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We extend Samuelson’s (1969) discrete-time dynamic consumption and investment optimization problem to the case where the investor is intolerant of any decline in her standard of living. This is interpreted as a constraint that the consumption rate is non-decreasing over time. The investor first guarantees a consumption perpetuity at the current consumption rate and then allocates the remaining wealth under a state-dependent, adjusted coefficient of relative risk aversion.</br>
