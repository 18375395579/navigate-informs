<br>Title: Optimization of Forest Fuel Logistics</br><br>Author: Mikael Ronnqvist, Department of Finance and Management Science, Norwegian School of Economics, NHH, Helleveien 30, NO-5045, Bergen, Norway, mikael.ronnqvist@nhh.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mikael Frisk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The use of forest fuel in combined heat and power plants is increasing, and procurement and transportation of fuel is a large part of the overall cost. The planning must consider different chipping systems that can be located at harvest areas, terminals or mills and a large variation in demand.  Several truck systems are included and there are specific capacities for both transportation and chipping. We describe DSS together with results from a case study at a large forest company in Sweden.</br>
