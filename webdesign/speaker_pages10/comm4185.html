<br>Title: Pricing American Options By Numerical Replication: Quadratic Programming Approach</br><br>Author: Timofey Turko, University of Florida, jk13@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stanislav Uryasev, Valeriy Ryabchenko</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The paper considers a quadratic programming approach to pricing American options in an incomplete market. The algorithm replicates an option by a portfolio consisting of the underlying security and a risk-free bond. To make the model robust we incorporate a set of American option specific monotonicity constraints that are theoretically justified for general price dynamics processes. We populate the model with historical sample paths of the underlying security or with Monte Carlo simulated paths.</br>
