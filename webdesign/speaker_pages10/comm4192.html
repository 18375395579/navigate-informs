<br>Title: Robust Electrical Distribution Network Design under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Pratik Mital, Ph.D. Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, pratik_mital@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Huang, Marc Goetschalckx</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Outages due to natural disasters like hurricanes, earthquakes etc. or due to falling of trees can render parts of the network to become dysfunctional and results in the customers losing power. The network should be robust under these uncertain events to maintain a high level of electrical service reliability. The uncertainty of the future is modeled as a set of scenarios. An optimization model is developed that re-designs the existing power network to make it more robust under uncertainty.</br>
