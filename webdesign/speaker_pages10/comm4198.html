<br>Title: Allocating Defensive Resources for Disengaging Terrorist Attack Intensions</br><br>Author: Gilberto Montibeller, Tenured Lecturer in Decision Sciences, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London, WC2A2AE, United Kingdom, G.Montibeller@lse.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mischel Belderrain, Marcelo Zawadzki</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a descriptive/prescriptive methodology, in a game theoretic style, which allows prescriptive advices to decision makers who must allocate defence resources to mitigate the risk of a terrorist attack. Unlike traditional approaches which aim to define the best protection for the higher risks, we seek for the best allocation overall that disengages the opponent at most to perform any sort of attack.</br>
