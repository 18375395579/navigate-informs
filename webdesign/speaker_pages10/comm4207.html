<br>Title: Systematic Optimistic Bias in Market Equilibria: Application to the Northwest European Power Market</br><br>Author: Ming-Che Hu, Johns Hopkins University, Department Geography & Environ. Engineering, Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States of America, mhu4@jhu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin F. Hobbs</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Under uncertain costs and demand, outcomes of market models suffer from optimistic biases, where the projected performance of markets is better, on average, than what is actually realized.  Net benefit estimates for new technologies are also optimistically biased under certain assumptions.  Biases are quantified for a parameterized power market model.</br>
