<br>Title: A New 10-30 Rule: An Investigation of Hedge Fund Performance Fees via Behavioral Finance</br><br>Author: Steven Kou, Professor, Columbia University, 801C Schapiro CEPSR, New York, United States of America, sk75@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuedong He</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A main cause of the recent financial crisis is excessive risk taking due to the limited liability of fund managers and corporations. We show that in most cases it is possible to improve the satisfaction of regulators, fund managers, and fund investors simultaneously by replacing the traditional 20% performance fee scheme with a new 10-30 first-loss scheme, in which fund managers take 30% performance fee in return for their 10% first-loss capital investment.</br>
