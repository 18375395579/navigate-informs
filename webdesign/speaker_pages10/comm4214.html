<br>Title: The Satiation Model</br><br>Author: Manel Baucells, Professor, Rand Corporation, 1776 Main St., Santa Monica, CA, 90407, United States of America, mbaucells@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The standard discounted utility model defined over arbitrary time intervals suffers from a major inadequacy: lack of continuity in the space of consumption. A general condition is known to restore continuity, but it has not been sufficiently explored to produce a model with convincing economic properties. We remedy this situation by proposing a model that incorporates satiation. We explore the optimal solutions, which involve both consumption rates (sips) and discrete consumption gulps.</br>
