<br>Title: BONUS Algorithm for Large Scale Stochastic Nonlinear Programming Problems in Energy Systems</br><br>Author: Urmila Diwekar, President, Vishwamitra Research Institute, 368 56-th Street, Clarendon Hills, IL, 60514, United States of America, urmila@vri-custom.org</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this work, we present the Better Optimization of Nonlinear Uncertain Systems (BONUS) algorithm for large scale stochastic nonlinear programming problems.  Applications are presented from the energy sector. These include sensor placement in power plants, real time optimization for water management in power plants, and stochastic optimization of biofuel manufacturing.</br>
