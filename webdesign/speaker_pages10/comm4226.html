<br>Title: Optimal Resource Allocation for Defense of Multiple Targets</br><br>Author: Vicki Bier, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Dept. of Industrial and Systems Eng., 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, bier@engr.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jaime Menoyo, Naraphorn Haphuriwat</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Allocating a fixed budget to defense of multiple targets is a challenging task. We apply a rigorous model to the problem of identifying optimal allocations.  In particular, we explore how the optimal allocation depends on the cost effectiveness of security investments, the defender’s valuations of the targets, and the defender’s uncertainty about the attacker’s target valuations.  Our results show that the cost effectiveness of defensive investment has a huge impact on the optimal allocation.</br>
