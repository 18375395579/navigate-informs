<br>Title: Scenario Generation and Reduction Applied to Long-term Power Generation Expansion Planning with Risk</br><br>Author: Yonghan Feng, Iowa State Univseristy, 3024 Black Engr, Ames, United States of America, yhfeng@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sarah Ryan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A stochastic program minimizes the combined expected cost and CVaR of long term power generation expansion planning. Scenarios are generated from stochastic process models of demand and natural gas price and then reduced by a new heuristic called forward selection in wait-and-see clusters (FSWC). Numerical results in a twenty-year case study indicate substantial computational savings while identifying similar solutions as those obtained by applying forward selection alone.</br>
