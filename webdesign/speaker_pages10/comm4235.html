<br>Title: Alternative Energy Strategy</br><br>Author: Ray Strong, IBM, strong@almaden.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ruoyi Zhou, Larry Proctor</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We report on a systematic exploration of trends in R&D investment in alternative electrical energy sources via information mining of patent activity. We compare coal, wind, thermal, hydro, nuclear, and solar. Patent trends suggest the wisdom of planning for significant improvements in the economic efficiency of photovoltaic electricity generation. We discuss why there might be less acceleration in patent activity for other alternative energy sources.</br>
