<br>Title: Joint Planning of Energy Storage and Transmission for Wind Energy Generation</br><br>Author: Wei Qi, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, qiwei@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yong Liang, Z. Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Regions with abundant wind energy usually have no ready access to power infrastructure. We develop an approach to determining the sizes and sites of energy storage stations as well as the corresponding topology and capacity of the transmission network.  A location-inventory model is formulated to solve for the energy storage-transmission network with uncapacitated storage. Then we incorporate storage sizing decisions by deriving conservative estimates of the expected energy overflow.</br>
