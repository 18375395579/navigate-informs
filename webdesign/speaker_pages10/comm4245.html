<br>Title: A Two-stage Methodology for Bad Debt Optimized Presumptive Write-off</br><br>Author: Jeremy Wortz, Manager - Operations Research & Analytics, West Asset Management, 7171, Mercy Road, Omaha, NE, 68130, United States of America, jwortz@west.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gediminas Murauskas, Abhinav Anand</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Presumptive write-off of bad debts portfolios while minimizing potential collection losses is a key cost containment strategy for lenders and creditors. Using an example of a healthcare bad debt portfolio we present a two-stage methodology to achieve this. First we develop a predictive model to prioritize delinquent accounts for liquidation and then use stochastic and non-stochastic binary programming to optimize account balance and model scores on a segmented surface.</br>
