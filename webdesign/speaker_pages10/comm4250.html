<br>Title: Demand vs. Supply-side Investment in Humanitarian Operations</br><br>Author: Karthik Natarajan, Assistant Professor, University of Minnesota, Carlson School of Management, Minneapolis, MN, 55435, United States of America, knataraj@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jayashankar Swaminathan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Addressing both supply- and demand-side constraints are vital to increasing coverage in humanitarian settings. We study the problem of identifying the optimal mix of supply- and demand-side investments in a budget-constrained environment and offer insights into the impact of supply- and demand-side parameters on the investment mix. We also consider a decentralized setting where demand mobilization activities are contracted to a third party and identify coordinating performance-based contracts.</br>
