<br>Title: Optimal Foreclosed Housing Bidding Policies for Community Development Corporations</br><br>Author: Senay Solak, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, solak@isenberg.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Armagan Bayram</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider bid/no-bid type decisions for nonprofit community organizations that acquire and redevelop foreclosed properties as part of the societal response to foreclosures. Based on a stochastic dynamic programming formulation, we develop procedures to determine whether a property should be bid on and at what rate. Some numerical analyses are presented based on real-world data.</br>
