<br>Title: Finding and Valuing What's Next Technology</br><br>Author: Chris Johnson, Manager, Risk & Value Technologies Lab, GE Global Research, 1 Research Circle, Niskayuna, NY, 12301, United States, johnsonch@crd.ge.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: What's next and why? If our objectives include creating economic value for our projects, there exists a need to describe the context and risk/return of the requisite investment.  Both the systemic approach to finding what should be next and our communication are critical to build commitment for action. A simulation and optimization based approach that incorporates the path dependencies and stochastic nature of potential scenarios into a financial objective function is presented.</br>
