<br>Title: Determining Reserve Zone Requirements from the Energy and Ancillary Service Co-optimization</br><br>Author: Yonghong Chen, Consulting Engineer, MISO, 720 City Center Drive, Carmel, IN, 46077, United States of America, ychen@misoenergy.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Gribik</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A new approach was proposed and implemented at MISO to address the reserve deliverability issue. MISO enhanced the co-optimization process so that it can evaluate the impact that deploying cleared reserves on a zonal basis would have on specified transmission constraints. Reserve zone requirements are solved to meet both market-wide reserve requirements and deliverability requirements.  MISO is looking at a more comprehensive solution in which procurement of reserves is modeled on a nodal basis.</br>
