<br>Title: Electric Vehicles with a Battery Switching Station: Adoption and Environmental Impact</br><br>Author: Buket Avci, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77300, France, buket.avci@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Serguei Netessine, Karan Girotra</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a novel switching-station based business model for the deployment of electric vehicles. We develop a stylized analytical model that captures the salient features of EV adoption decision by modeling range anxiety and the impact of different ownership structures (selling miles vs. selling batteries). We find that electric vehicles with switching stations can incent adoption and reduce oil dependence but, paradoxically, this increased adoption may not necessarily benefit the environment.</br>
