<br>Title: Mapping the Growth Path Through Controlled Burn</br><br>Author: Nile Hatch, Marriott School - BYU, Provo, UT, 84602, United States of America, nile@byu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Balancing growth against profitability is one of the (many) fundamental challenges of entrepreneurial activity.  When innovation confers competitive advantage, growth still requires investment that must be funded through margins or investors.  With a game theoretic model of rivalry, I analyze the tradeoff between margins and growth and illustrate optimal growth paths for various competitive advantages.</br>
