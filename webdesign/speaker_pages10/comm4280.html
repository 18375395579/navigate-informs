<br>Title: An Options Theory Method to Value Emissions Control Devices</br><br>Author: Dalia Echeverri, PhD Student, Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, dpe@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In responding to uncertain future air-emissions regulations, decision makers in the electricity industry face tremendous uncertainty and incur significant financial risk.  We show how decision makers may value certain options as hedges against these risks. More generally, we demonstrate how a method of options-valuation can inform the choices of the electricity industry and policy makers.</br>
