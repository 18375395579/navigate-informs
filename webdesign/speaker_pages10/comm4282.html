<br>Title: Evacuation Planning for Livestock in a Case of a Nuclear Power Plant Accident</br><br>Author: Ruriko Yoshida, University of Kentucky, 325D MDS building, Lexington, KY, 40506, United States of America, ruriko.yoshida@uky.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ines Aviles-Spadoni, Chrysafis Vogiatzis, Shigeki Imamoto</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Development of a mathematical formulation of an evacuation plan for livestock around a nuclear power plant is essential for farmers to lessen financial, emotional impacts from losing their animals. So we propose two mathematical models for evacuation plan for livestock via integer programming (IP) over networks. Due to NP-completeness of IP, we propose a heuristic algorithm for our problem. We end with simulation results/experiments with the map near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants.</br>
