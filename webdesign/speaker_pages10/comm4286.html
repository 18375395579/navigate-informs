<br>Title: Networking Low-power Energy Harvesting Devices: Measurements and Algorithms</br><br>Author: Aya Wallwater, Columbia University, Rm. 325 Mudd Building, 500 W. 120 Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, aw2589@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gil Zussman, Maria Gorlatova</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recent advances in energy harvesting will soon enable networks composed of energy harvesting devices.These devices will operate using very low energy.We characterize the light energy available in indoor environments and present new algorithms, which requires non-traditional approaches, since energy harvesting shifts the nature of energy-aware protocols from minimizing energy expenditure to optimizing it. We develop algorithms for systems with predictable energy inputs, as well as stochastic.</br>
