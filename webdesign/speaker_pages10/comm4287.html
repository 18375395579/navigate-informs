<br>Title: United States Army Brigade Combat Team Model with Demand Reduction Over Time</br><br>Author: Mike Teter, Colorado School of Mines, 1500 Illinois Street, Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, mteter@mymail.mines.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lee Ewing</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The US Army is reducing forces over the next few years and requires a model to help senior leader’s to make informed  troop level decisions.  We present a model  to optimally size the United States Army to a certain troop goal while meeting operational, personnel, stationing and budgetary constraints.  The model is a mixed integer program with multistage scheduling of demand reduction to a target troop level while lessening the turbulence on soldiers.</br>
