<br>Title: Credit Risk Model and Insurance Pricing for Reverse Mortgages</br><br>Author: Gigi Yuen-Reed, Consultant, IBM, 14 Third Street SE, Washington, DC, 20003, United States of America, gigi.yuen@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Reverse mortgages (RM) provide senior citizens cash payments and/or a credit line secured by their home’s equity. While the primary risk of traditional mortgage is default, RM’s risks are borrowers?mortality, mobility, and the liquidation value. To provide a more efficient financial pricing structure for RM, we formulated a loan repayment model from historical data and developed a stochastic pricing model to incorporate the impact of house price appreciation and interest rate.</br>
