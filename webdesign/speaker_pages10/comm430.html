<br>Title: Disruption Management during Supply Chain Disruptions</br><br>Author: Cameron MacKenzie, University of Oklahoma, 202 W Boyd St, Norman, OK, United States of America, cmackenzie@ou.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kash Barker</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Many firms suffered from supply disruptions due to the recent Japanese earthquake and tsunami. We analyze these disruptions by developing a model in which several suppliers?production facilities are rendered inoperable. Each supplier must decide whether to move production to an alternate facility or wait for its facility to reopen. If suppliers do not produce at alternate facilities, firms will need to decide how to mitigate the impacts of a supply shortage.</br>
