<br>Title: Optimal Collateralization under Bilateral Default Risk</br><br>Author: Daniel Bauer, Georgia State University, PO Box 4036, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, dbauer@gsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Luz R Sotomayor, Enrico Biffis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider optimal collateralization in OTC transactions with bilateral default risk. In particular, we jointly solve for the transaction price and optimal collateral rules in a setting that takes into account the credit quality and funding needs of both parties. Our framework can be used for understanding Credit Support Annex (CSA) pricing and Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) charges in structuring OTC transactions. Our results provide insights on the key drivers of collateral rules.</br>
