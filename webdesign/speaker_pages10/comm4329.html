<br>Title: Optimal Capital Requirements in Interbank Networks</br><br>Author: Jongsoo Hong, Duke Univ. Fuqua School of Business, 1 Fuqua Drive Fuqua School of Business, Durham, United States of America, jongsoo.hong@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Brown</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a network of banks, with connections representing interbank liabilities, and study the problem of optimally trading off between capital reserves and systemic risk. In a model without default costs, the problem may be formulated as a stochastic linear program. Default costs make the problem much more challenging, and we discuss approximation methods. We demonstrate the methods on an example using data from a central bank.</br>
