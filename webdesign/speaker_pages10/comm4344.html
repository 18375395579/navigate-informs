<br>Title: Optimal Design and Operational Planning for Co-Located Ethanol Plant</br><br>Author: Guiping Hu, Iowa State University, 3014 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, gphu@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Longwen Ou, Robert Brown</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The commercialization of cellulosic ethanol is hindered by high capital and production cost. In this study, a mathematical model is formulated to optimize the design and operation of a flexible co-located first and second generation ethanol plant. The plant design and operational decisions are studied. The optimal product portfolios and equipment capacity planning under a variety market conditions are analyzed. The net present values of the flexible plant and a convention plant are compared.</br>
