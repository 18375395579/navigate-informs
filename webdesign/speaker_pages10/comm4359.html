<br>Title: Multi-stage Stochastic Decision Making Framework for Providing Ancillary Services with Active Demand</br><br>Author: Mahnoosh Alizadeh, University of California Davis, 644 Alvarado Ave, Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, malizadeh@ucdavis.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anna Scaglione</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present an integrated decision making framework for a load serving entity providing ancillary services to the wholesale electricity market.The multi-settlement market structure induces an interdependence among strategic decisions made at different time stages.To model dynamics of demand when making decisions,we propose a classification-based model that captures the effect of individual appliance loads at aggregate levels,with reasonable effort.Electric Vehicles are showcased as an example.</br>
