<br>Title: Renewable Energy and Competition for Biomass : Implications for Land Use and Food Prices</br><br>Author: Hayri Onal, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 305 Mumford Hall, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, h-onal@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaoguang Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recent US energy policies aim to substitute fossil fuels with renewable fuels. The RFS relies largely on biofuels produced from biomass, RPS requires some of the power generation to come from biomass in addition to solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal sources. We present a large scale nonlinear MIP model to simulate the competition between RFS & RPS for limited biomass and determine the spatial layout of biomass production and location of processing facilities. Empirical results are presented.</br>
