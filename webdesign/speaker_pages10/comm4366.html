<br>Title: Decision Rules in Power Systems Operation and Planning</br><br>Author: Daniel Kuhn, EPFL, ODY 1 01 B (Odyssea)  Station 5  CH-1015, Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland, daniel.kuhn@epfl.ch</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many decision problems in power systems operation and planning are naturally formulated as optimization models with the following key attributes. They are high-dimensional, uncertainty-affected and dynamic. As such, they are not susceptible to classical dynamic or stochastic programming techniques. In this talk we discuss how such problems can be addressed with decision rule methods that have recently been popularized in robust optimization.</br>
