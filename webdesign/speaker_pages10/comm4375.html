<br>Title: Robust Material Handling System Design Based on the Risk versus Cost Tradeoff</br><br>Author: Marc Goetschalckx, H. Milton Stewart School of Systems and Industrial Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, marc.goetschalckx@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pratik Mital, Edward Huang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Major material handling systems have extended life times but are designed ignoring future uncertainty and rely only on mean-value data and algorithms.  We present a design methodology that identifies all the Pareto-optimal configurations with respect to a cost and risk of a material handling system.  The algorithm is structured such that the master problem makes the risk tradeoffs and the sub problem embeds the material handling system knowledge.  Numerical experience will be shared.</br>
