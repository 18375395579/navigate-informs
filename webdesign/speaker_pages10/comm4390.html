<br>Title: Incentives of Generation Firms for Long-Term Investment in the U.S. Electricity Transmission System</br><br>Author: Enzo Sauma, Assistant Professor, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Av. Vicuna Mackenna #4860, Raul Deves Hall, Piso 3, Macul, Santiago, Chile, esauma@ing.puc.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shmuel Oren</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the incentives that generation firms have in the U.S. electricity markets for supporting long-term social-welfare-improving transmission investments. We also examine how such incentives are affected by the ownership structure of financial transmission rights (FTRs). We show that generation firms may have disincentives for making socially beneficial transmission investments in the U.S. system. However, we also show how this situation could be reversed by correctly allocating FTRs.</br>
