<br>Title: Portfolio Optimization under Phase Locking</br><br>Author: Roy Kwon, Associate Professor, University of Toronto, 5 King's College, Toronto, ON, M5S3G8, Canada, rkwon@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic mean-variance optimization problem that uses a phase locking factor model for returns. A three regime switching process is generated to implement the phase locking. Computational results indicate that a strategy of active re-balancing via the stochastic MVO model is superior to a standard MVO approach even under transaction costs.</br>
