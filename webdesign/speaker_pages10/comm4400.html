<br>Title: Bulk Tank Allocation to Improve Distribution Planning for the Industrial Gas Industry</br><br>Author: Leily Farrokhvar, Doctoral Student, Virginia Tech, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, leily@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kimberly Ellis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: An important strategic level decision in the industrial gas industry involves the allocation of bulk gas tanks to customer sites.  The bulk tank allocation problem determines the preferred size of bulk tanks to assign to customer sites in order to minimize tank investment costs and gas distribution costs.  The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program and then solved using a decomposition approach.  The approach is evaluated using data from an international industrial gas distributer.</br>
