<br>Title: Effect of Market Rules on Generation Investments in Power Systems with Significant Renewables</br><br>Author: Mort Webster, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, mort@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fernando de Sisternes, Jose Ignacio Perez-Arriaga</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We use a capacity expansion model with unit commitment constraints to find the socially optimal generation mix for a given penetration of intermittent renewables. For this mix, we calculate hourly day-ahead prices and cash flows for all units in the system under alternative market rules for treating startup costs.  We demonstrate the impacts of operating a mix with more renewables than it was designed for. Results from this analysis will allow assessing the shortcomings of current market rules.</br>
