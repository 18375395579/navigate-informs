<br>Title: The Impact of Monitoring and Covenants in Asset-based Lending</br><br>Author: Dan Iancu, Assistant Professor, Stanford University, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, daniancu@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nikos Trichakis, Gerry Tsoukalas</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In order to mitigate default risk, lenders impose covenants on borrowers and monitor their performance over time. We analyze the impact of such covenants and monitoring on the strategic interactions between borrowers and lenders in the retail asset-based lending industry. We find that covenants can be a double-edged sword: while they provide additional insurance to lenders, they can also adversely impact the borrowers?capacity investments, impeding supply-chain coordination.</br>
