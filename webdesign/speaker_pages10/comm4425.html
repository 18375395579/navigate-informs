<br>Title: Does a Regional Greenhouse Gas Policy Make Sense? A Case Study of CO2 Leakage & Emissions Spillover</br><br>Author: Yihsu Chen, University of California, Merced, 5200 N. Lake Rd., Merced, CA, United States of America, yihsu.chen@ucmerced.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Enzo Sauma</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a joint effort by 10 U.S. northeast states that will be in effect in 2009 to control CO2 emissions from power sector.  We perform a counterfactual analysis on the possible CO2 leakage and NOx and SO2 emissions spillover under 2006 market conditions. The results show that leakage in the expected RGGI allowances prices range could be 80?0%. This is accompanied with 50?0% increases of SO2 and NOx emissions spillover.</br>
