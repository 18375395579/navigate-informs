<br>Title: Robust Wind Farm Layout Optimization with Mixed Integer Programming</br><br>Author: Peter Y. Zhang, University of Toronto, 164 College Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G9, Canada, peteryun.zhang@mail.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Romero, Timothy Chan, Cristina Amon</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Wind farm layout optimization aims to find the most profitable layout, given the site condition and the wind regime. However, the latter is inherently uncertain due to errors in measurement, correlation, and forecasting. Previous studies on wind farm optimization assumed wind data to be perfectly accurate, which could lead to lower investor confidence and higher financial risk. This study presents a novel Robust MIP model to address such gap.</br>
