<br>Title: An Optimization Model for Owl Habitat Reserve Management</br><br>Author: Bala Krishnamoorthy, Washington State University, 103 Neill Hall, PO Box 643113, WSU, Pullman, WA, 99164-3113, United States, kbala@wsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Natalie Baerlocher, David Allen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop a model for the problem of designing habitat reserve areas to support endangered species. For the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO), we model the occupancy of a patch of land by a 0-1 variable. We develop a function called the Habitat Connectivity Index (HCI), which measures the overall  suitability of a habitat to sustain the owls. The decisions of which patch is to be sustained and which cleared from among candidate ones is modeled as a non-linear integer program that maximizes HCI.</br>
