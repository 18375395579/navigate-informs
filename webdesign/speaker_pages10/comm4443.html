<br>Title: Vulnerability Assessment of a Food Supply Chain to an Intentional Attack</br><br>Author: Alan Erera, Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, alerera@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yanling Chang, Yu Zhang, Chelsea (Chip) White</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We use a partially observed Markov game and a food supply chain process model to quantify the vulnerability of a food supply chain to contamination by an intelligent adversary using a chemical or biological agent.  The objective is compare food supply chain designs based on both productivity and vulnerability.</br>
