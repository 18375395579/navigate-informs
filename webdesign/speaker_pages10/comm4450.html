<br>Title: Cross Market Calibration of Credit Spreads</br><br>Author: Rajnish Kamat, Vice President, MSCI Barra, 2100 Milvia Street, Berkeley, CA, 94704, United States, Rajnish.Kamat@fea.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Goldberg, Vijay Poduri</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We use Credit Default Swap spread data along with equity market and balance sheet information to build a next generation structural model. The model uses an incomplete information framework and provides greater flexibility in calibration compared to the Merton model. Applications include rich-cheap analysis of credits, credit portfolio monitoring, pricing less liquid names, and deriving exposures to market variables for hedging.</br>
