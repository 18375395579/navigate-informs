<br>Title: Incorporating Uncertainty into an Optimal Selection of Suppliers and Ordering Plan</br><br>Author: Lei Li, University of Washington, Industrial Engineering, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States, leili@u.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zelda Zabinsky</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Supplier selection is an important strategic management decision.  Incorporating uncertain demand and supplier capacity into the optimization results in a more robust solution than treating them as deterministic values.  A stochastic programming model with recourse and a chance-constrained model are developed to optimize the selection of supplier and ordering plan.</br>
