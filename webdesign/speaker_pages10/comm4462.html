<br>Title: Effects of Electric Vehicles Adoption Pathway on the US Energy System</br><br>Author: Dong Gu Choi, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Room 336, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, doonggus@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Frank Kreikebaum, Deepakraj Divan, Valerie Thomas</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) can affect the development of the electric power system, the integration of intermittent renewable energy, and the overall efficiency of the vehicle fleet, with implications for costs, environmental impacts, and policy implementation. Using a set of models spanning the light-duty vehicle fleet and the electric power system, we evaluate numerous scenarios for EV integration into the energy system in eastern U.S. and argue linkages among the considerations.</br>
