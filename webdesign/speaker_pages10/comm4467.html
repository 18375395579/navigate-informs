<br>Title: R&D Portfolio Analysis of Low Carbon Energy Technologies for Climate Change Mitigation</br><br>Author: Rose Zdybel, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, 120D Marston Hall, Amherst, MA, United States of America, rozoe@msn.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze R&D portfolios of low carbon advanced energy technologies for climate change mitigation. We use the GCAM integrated assessment model to analyze the effects of combinations of low carbon energy   technologies on CO2 concentration stabilization costs and then combine the results with probabilistic data from expert elicitations. We also develop econometric relationships between variables to estimate results for input values other than those that are part of the elicitations.</br>
