<br>Title: Aircraft Operations for Minimum Environmental Impact</br><br>Author: Stephen Altus, Jeppesen, 225 West Santa Clara Street, Suite 1600, San Jose, CA, 95113, United States of America, steve.altus@jeppesen.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Geoffrey Bower</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: There is a direct relationship between aircraft operating costs, fuel, and emissions, but just how close are their optimal solutions?  We review current optimization methods, including the impact of rising fuel prices in the solution, and compare different merit functions.  How close are the results, and what is the sensitivity to changes in specific costs?  Ongoing research to optimize operations for cost and environment, including fleet and schedule implications, is described.</br>
