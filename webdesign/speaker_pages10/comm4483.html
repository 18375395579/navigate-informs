<br>Title: Modelling and Forecasting Electricity Price Risk with Quantile Regression</br><br>Author: Sjur Westgaard, Associate Professor, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 7491 Trondheim, Norway, sjur.westgaard@iot.ntnu.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Derek Bunn, Arne Andresen, Dipeng Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the capability of quantile regression (QR) methods to model and forecast the tails of the spot price in the UK electricity market. QR allows us to explore how the underlying price drivers affect the different quantiles of the distribution. We demonstrate how  lagged prices, prices of gas, coal and carbon, forecasts of demand and reserve margin in addition to price volatility influence the spot price distribution.</br>
