<br>Title: Multicriteria Security System Performance Assessment Using Fuzzy Logic</br><br>Author: William McGill, Assistant Professor, Penn State University, 307B IST Building, State College, PA, 16801, United States of America, wmcgill@ist.psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Modern security problems focus on sensibly allocating resources to decrease the magnitude of potential threats, decrease the chances of adversary success given an attempt, or minimize loss following a successful attack.  This talk describes a model that approximates the true relationship between defensive capabilities and probability of adversary success using techniques from fuzzy logic.  A simple example demonstrating the proposed model to support decision making accompanies this discussion.</br>
