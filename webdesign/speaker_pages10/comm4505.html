<br>Title: Optimizing Land Use within a Military Installation for Military and Ecological Conservation</br><br>Author: Hayri Onal, Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, University of Illinois at Champaign-Urba, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, h-onal@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sahan Dissanayake, James Westervelt</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a MIP approach for designing an optimal conservation reserve network within the boundaries of a military installation while satisfying specified military training and conservation requirements. The reserves are desired to be compact, sufficiently large, and close to each other, and must provide habitat services to designated species. Empirical results will also be presented.</br>
