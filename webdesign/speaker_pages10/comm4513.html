<br>Title: Risk Assessment and Critical Asset Analysis for Power Grids</br><br>Author: Farnaz Farzan, Graduate Student, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 96 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, FARNAZFN@eden.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ali Rezvani, Kaveh Akram, Mohsen Jafari</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of quantifying cyber-attack-related risk in power grids and critical asset identification.Risk is defined as a function of consequence,threat and vulnerability.The consequence assessment is available through existing tools for power grids.The likelihood of threat is taken to be one.The vulnerability assessment includes an attack map in which the reachablity of a node,possible further progress, and the minimum penetration needed for a successful attack are determined.</br>
