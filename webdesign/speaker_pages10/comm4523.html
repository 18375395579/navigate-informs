<br>Title: An Efficient Simulation Procedure for Point Estimation of Expected Shortfall</br><br>Author: Ming Liu, Ph.D. Student, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Room C231, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, ming-liu@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Barry L Nelson, Jeremy Staum</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Given a set of scenarios, expected shortfall is an average of the largest losses that occur in any scenario. We consider the case where a portfolio's loss in each scenario is estimated by simulation. We present a simulation procedure that allocates a fixed computational budget efficiently among scenarios and show that it estimates expected shortfall with a much smaller mean squared error than a standard simulation procedure, which allocates equal computational resources to each scenario.</br>
