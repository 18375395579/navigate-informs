<br>Title: Energy Program Targeting: Data and Actions</br><br>Author: Adrian Albert, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, 350 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, adalbert@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: What customers should an energy utility enroll in their energy efficiency and demand-response programs? We present methodology for profiling customers' usage from large amounts of high-resolution sensor (“smart meter? data. We develop a targeting model expressed as an integer optimization problem that uses consumption characteristics to select the best subset of customers to achieve set efficiency targets. Understanding consumption patterns greatly improves expected program performance.</br>
