<br>Title: Robust Portfolio Techniques for Coherent Risk Minimization</br><br>Author: Jun-ya Gotoh, Chuo University, 1-13-27 Kasuga, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 112-8551, Japan, jgoto@indsys.chuo-u.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Akiko Takeda</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Coherent risk measures have gained popularity in the finance literature. However, its optimization may suffer from fragility associated with estimation error. By employing a robust optimization modeling, we discuss a way for making the solution robust over a certain range of estimation uncertainty. We show that different types of uncertainty sets can be simultaneously employed without losing convexity. Also, we discuss the Goldfarb-Iyengar (2003)-like use of factor-model.</br>
