<br>Title: Quantifying Supply Chain Risks Using Methods from Process Safety</br><br>Author: Pavan Kumar Naraharisetti, Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences, 1 Pesek Road, Jurong Island, Singapore, Sg, 627833, Singapore, naraharisetti_pavan_kumar@ices.a-star.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rajagopalan Srinivasan, Arief Adhitya, Iftekhar Karimi</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Risk and disruption management has become imperative for today's supply chains. Quantifying risks in terms of potential loss of money, time, or material provides a basis for evaluating the efficacy of risk management strategies. To achieve this, we build on well-developed quantitative methods from chemical process risk management and extend them to the supply chain context.</br>
