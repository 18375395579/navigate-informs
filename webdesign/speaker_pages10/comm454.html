<br>Title: Supply Chain Networks with Corporate Financial Risks and Trade Credits under Economic Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Jose Cruz, Associate Professor, University of Connecticut, School of Business, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, jose.cruz@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zugang Liu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper provides a framework to investigate how financial risks affect the values of interconnected supply chain firms' profitability, as well as, the cash and credit transactions.  From a network perspective,  we develop a variational inequality equilibrium model in conjunction with capital asset pricing model and the net present value  to determine the optimal supply chain prices, profits, and implicit equity values of supply chain firms under financial risks and economic uncertainty.</br>
