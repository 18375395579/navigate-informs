<br>Title: Methods for Stochastic Complementarity Models of Natural Gas Market Equilibria</br><br>Author: Steve Gabriel, Assistant Professor, Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, 1143 Martin Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, sgabriel@umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jifang Zhuang, Ruud Egging</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a detailed model of the natural gas market where certain components are stochastic (e.g., inverse demand function coefficients). Combined within a Nash-Cournot framework for the market players, the resulting model is an instance of a stochastic complementarity problem. As such both game theoretic and risk elements are addressed. We describe recent numerical efforts to solve these and related stochastic games using scenario reduction techniques.</br>
