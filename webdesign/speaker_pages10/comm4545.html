<br>Title: Metrics to Assess and Manage Computer Network Security Technologies</br><br>Author: Soumyo Moitra, Senior MTS, Carnegie Mellon University, 4500 Fifth Avenue, Room 4120, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, smoitra@sei.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: To assess the utility of network security technologies, criteria are needed to judge how useful they are for security. We present metrics that are important for security management. A security technology should be judged in terms of how well these metrics can be derived from their outputs. These metrics quantify cyber attack scenarios based on data security technologies should provide. Functional needs for security technologies are related to how they can provide data to estimate these metrics.</br>
