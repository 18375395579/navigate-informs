<br>Title: Using Markowitz Portfolio Optimization to Guide Reforestation Under Multiple Climate Change Scenario</br><br>Author: Kevin Crowe, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Forestry, Lakehead University, 955 Oliver Road, Thunder Bay, ON, P7B 5, Canada, kcrowe1@lakeheadu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Parker</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A major difficulty of planned adaptation to climate change arises from the uncertainty of estimated changes in climate parameters.  The general problem addressed by this study is that of designing a decision support system to select an optimal set of seed sources to be used in regenerating forests in an environment of multiple, equally plausible future climates.</br>
