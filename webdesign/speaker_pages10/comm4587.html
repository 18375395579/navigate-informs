<br>Title: Design of Capacitated Supply Chains under the Risk of Disruptions</br><br>Author: Pablo Garcia-Herreros, PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, pgarciah@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John M. Wassick, Ignacio E. Grossmann</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The supply chain design under the risk of disruptions is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problem. We consider the location, allocation of capacity, and inventory management of the distribution centers. We propose a special implementation of Benders decomposition that significantly strengthens the lower bounds. An industrial-scale example is solved showing that this problem can solved effectively, while illustrating the importance of the capacity constraints.</br>
