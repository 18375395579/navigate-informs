<br>Title: Continuous-time Portfolio Optimization with Finite Element Methods</br><br>Author: Zhen Liu, Assistant Professor, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO, 65401, United States of America, zliu@mst.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Birge</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: To study a portfolio optimization problem with transaction costs we set up a buy-and-hold problem, which can be transformed into a convection-dominated PDE problem.  To solve the problem with high-order numerical scheme and overcome the spurious oscillations, we use the Local Discontinuous Galerkin method and a sequential optimization process to effectively determine the no-trade region. Our error estimate will help stochastic optimization approach by providing reliable benchmarks.</br>
