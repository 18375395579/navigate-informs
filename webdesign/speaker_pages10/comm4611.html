<br>Title: How Fast Should a Cash Constrained Firm Grow? Strategies that Balance Growth and Survival</br><br>Author: Yasin Alan, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, Vanderbilt University, Owen School, 401 21st Ave. S., Nashville, TN, 37203, United States of America, Yasin.Alan@owen.vanderbilt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vishal Gaur</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A cash constrained firm has to balance growth and survival when making its operational and borrowing decisions. We study the operational implications of this trade-off in a finite horizon cash-constrained inventory model with non-stationary demand, which is a function of the firm’s past order quantities. We analyze four growth scenarios to capture the impact of financing constraints and the bankruptcy process on the firm’s stocking decisions.</br>
