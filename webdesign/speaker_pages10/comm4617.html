<br>Title: Critical Infrastructure Protection Decision Support System</br><br>Author: Michael Samsa, Decision and Risk Analysis Group Leader, Argonne National Laboratory, Building 900, 9700 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL, 60439-4832, United States, msamsa@anl.gov</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The Critical Infrastructure Protection Decision Support System is a set of system dynamics models that estimate interdependent consequences from infrastructure disruptions, coupled with a multi-attribute decision model that can reflect the value trade-offs and risk attitudes of the decision making organization. A hypothetical infectious disease case is used to illustrate how the model is used to inform decision makers.</br>
