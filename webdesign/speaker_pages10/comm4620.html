<br>Title: Scheduling Flexible Loads in Multi-settlement Electricity Markets</br><br>Author: Mahdi Kefayati, Research Assistant, The University of Texas at Austin, 2501 Speedway ENS 506A, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, kefayati@utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ross Baldick</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the decision making problem of a Load Aggregator which buys energy and sells ancillary services on behalf of a group of flexible loads (e.g. Electric Vehicles) in a multi-settlement market. Taking an stochastic optimization approach, we propose a model that captures the interdependence of decisions and propose a data driven scenario generation method that enables effective representation of uncertainty. Finally, Electric Vehicle load scheduling is demonstrated as a case study.</br>
