<br>Title: Carbon Abatement Strategies for Electric Utilities</br><br>Author: Jayant Kalagnanam, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Hts 10591, United States of America, jayant@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stuart Siegel, Dharmashankar Subramanian, Rahul Jain, Anshul Gupta</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The abatement of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning power plants requires the adoption of new technologies such as alternate energy sources (wind, solar, nuclear), carbon sequestration or carbon emissions reduction credits.  The cost and efficacy of all these alternatives is uncertain.  Abatement policies would therefore require capacity planning across uncertain alternatives and require stochastic programming.  We will present a method with an example.</br>
