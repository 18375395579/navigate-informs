<br>Title: Valuation of Interdependent IT Projects - A Real Option Approach Considering Unhedgeable Risks</br><br>Author: Steffen Zimmermann, Assistant Professor, University of Innsbruck, Universitaetsstr. 15, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria, Steffen.Zimmermann@uibk.ac.at</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marcel Mueller, Sebastian Stöckl</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: To value interdependent IT projects, financial option pricing models like the Black-Scholes model (BSM) are frequently suggested. However, one major concern about applying these models for real options, is the assumption that all risks need to be hedged by a replicating portfolio. Thus, we present an enhancement of the BSM where we consider hedgeable and unhedgeable risks by two seperate stochastic processes. In doing so, we find out that the BSM undervalues real options systematically.</br>
