<br>Title: CGE Model for Clean Electricity Standards: Impacts on the U.S. Electric Power Sector</br><br>Author: Ekundayo Shittu, Assistant Professor, Tulane University, 7 McAlister Dr., New Orleans, LA, 70118, United States of America, eshittu@tulane.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ian Sue Wing</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a technology-detailed bottom-up CGE capacity expansion model with a macro-consistent calibration of activities via column disaggregation of the social accounting matrix. We address the congruency of technology substitution elasticity with clean electricity standards given a hybrid setting and EIA’s generator pool mapping.</br>
