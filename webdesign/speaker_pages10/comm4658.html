<br>Title: Managing Wind-based Electricity Generation with Storage and Transmission Capacity</br><br>Author: Yangfang Zhou, PhD candidate, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, United States of America, yangfang@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Scheller-Wolf, Nicola Secomandi, Stephen Smith</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of operating wind-based electricity generation with storage (for instance, a grid-level electricity battery) in a market. We demonstrate that mismanaging such a system can significantly reduce its value. We also show that storage can greatly increase the monetary value of the wind farm, and, while it typically increases the total energy sold to the market, in certain situations it may also-?paradoxically--decrease the total wind energy sold to the market.</br>
