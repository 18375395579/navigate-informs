<br>Title: A Discrete Event Simulation Approach to Post-filing Process Modeling</br><br>Author: Erica Layne Morrison, Managing Consultant, IBM, 12902 Federal Systems Parkway Drive, Fairfax, VA, 22033, United States of America, elaynemorrison@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Brann, Sandy Lin, David Teale</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Over the last 2 years, IRS Research has used discrete event simulation (DES) to model reengineering recommendations with operating divisions. In evaluating process changes, tax administrators consider revenue impacts, internal costs, and external taxpayer impacts.  It is desirable, though challenging, to consider these impacts from within an integrated decision framework. We evaluate the success of the DES approach in providing such a framework.</br>
