<br>Title: A Bilevel Approach to Transmission Expansion Planning</br><br>Author: Antonio J. Conejo, Professor, University of Castilla - La Mancha, Department of Electrical Engineering, Campus Universitario s/n, Ciudad Real, 13071, Spain, Antonio.Conejo@uclm.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Raquel Garcia-Bertrand, Lina Garces, Ruben Romero</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a bilevel model for transmission expansion planning. A market environment is considered where producers and consumers trade freely electric energy through a pool. The target of the transmission planner, modeled through the upper problem, is both to maximize global social welfare and to minimize network investment cost. This upper problem is constrained by a collection of market clearing problems representing pool trading, and whose objective functions correspond to social welfare.</br>
