<br>Title: How to Choose Free Agent Batters?</br><br>Author: Katsunori Ano, Professor, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Shibaura Institute of  Technology, 307 Fukasaku, Minuma-ku, Saitama, 337-8570, Japan, k-ano@shibaura-it.ac.jp</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic model to choose free agent batters. It maximizes the expected earned run obtained by the optimal batting order with him, which based on Markov chain formulation of Baseball, and also minimizes a risk of the batter. This stochastic portfolio analysis suggests the decision for which batter is best. The model can impose manager's subjective perspective of the free agent batter.</br>
