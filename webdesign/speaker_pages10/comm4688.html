<br>Title: Planning and Coordination of Scattered Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems</br><br>Author: Kuo-Hao Chang, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan - ROC, chang@mx.nthu.edu.tw</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a two-stage stochastic programming  model to characterize the planning and coordination of scattered hybrid renewable energy systems when the power demand and renewable power are both uncertain.   We further propose an efficient method to solve the model. Some realistic size instances are created to validate the viability of the proposed method in real settings.</br>
