<br>Title: Distributed Joint Budget Allocation and Location Problem for Alternative-fuel Stations</br><br>Author: Ismail Capar, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, TAMU 3367, College Station, TX, 77843, United States of America, capar@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): In-Jae Jeong</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Government agencies (GAs) around the world are providing grants to service providers (SPs) for building infrastructure for alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs). While GAs aim to increase the number of adopters; SPs want to maximize profit. These objectives may not be well aligned. We consider this joint funding allocation and AFV station location problem under partial information sharing where parties do not reveal the private information of individual objective functions and budget constraints.</br>
