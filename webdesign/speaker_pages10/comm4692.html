<br>Title: An Optimization Model for Advanced Biofuel Production based on Bio-oil Gasification</br><br>Author: Qi Li, Iowa State University, 0076 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, qili@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guiping Hu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this research, a two-stage stochastic programming is formulated. The first-stage makes the capital investment decisions including the locations and capacities of the bio-facilities (distributed small scale fast pyrolysis plants and centralized refining facility) while the second-stage determines the biomass and bio-fuels flows. This paper aims to find the optimal design of the supply chain considering uncertainties in biomass yield, biofuel price and transportation costs.</br>
