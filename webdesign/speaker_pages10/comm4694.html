<br>Title: Do HMO and Its For-Profit Expansion Jeopardize the Survival of Hospital Safety Net Services?</br><br>Author: Yu-Chu Shen, Assistant Professor of Economics, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, 93943, United States, yshen@nps.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study examines the effect of health maintenance organizations (HMO) and for-profit HMO share on the survival of safety net services in hospitals between 1990 and 2003. I find that the risks of shutting down hospital safety net services do not vary by different levels of overall HMO penetration in the current environment.  However, conditional on overall HMO penetration level, increasing for-profit presence of HMO does increase the risk of shutting down several safety net services.</br>
