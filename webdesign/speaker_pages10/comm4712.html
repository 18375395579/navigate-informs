<br>Title: Imposing Old-growth Patch Constraints in Forest Harvest Scheduling Models</br><br>Author: Marcos Goycoolea, Assistant Professor, Universidad Adolfo Ibanez, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Oficina 534 C., Santiago, Chile, marcos.goycoolea@uai.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rodolfo Carvajal, Miguel Constantino, Juan Pablo Vielma, Andres Weintraub</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A major challenge in harvest scheduling is to balance economic gain with preservation of wildlife habitat. One way of addressing wildlife preservation is to require large contiguous patches of mature forest. These requirements are very difficult to impose in planning models due to their complex combinatorial structure. We propose a new integer programming approach to integrating these constraints in existing revenue-maximizing harvest scheduling models. Computational results are presented.</br>
