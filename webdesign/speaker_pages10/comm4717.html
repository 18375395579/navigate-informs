<br>Title: Renewable Electricity Policies Comparison in the Long Run using Decomposition Methods</br><br>Author: Steffen Rebennack, Assistant Professor of Operations Research, Colorado School of Mines, 1500 Illinois St., Golden, CO, 80401, United States of America, srebenna@mines.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Timo Lohmann</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Many policies directly promote investment in renewable electricity generators. Other policies create incentives for investment in proportion to social value. We present a long-run planning model to compare the effect of these policies on investment decisions. The challenging part of this integrated model is to solve for equilibrium quantity and price for every hour of the horizon, which is typically more than 20 years. We propose a decomposition approach to solve this problem to optimality.</br>
