<br>Title: Combined Toll Pricing and Network Design for Hazardous Materials Transportation</br><br>Author: Masoumeh Taslimi, Research Assistant, University at Buffalo, 339-A, Bell Hall, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, Buffalo, NY, 14051, United States of America, masoumeh@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Changhyun Kwon, Rajan Batta</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Hazardous materials transport remains regulated due to its potential risk to health, safety, and environment. We investigate an application of the combination of toll pricing policy and network design and their effects on the carriers?route choices. We present a bi-level optimization problem to minimize the associated hazmat transport risk.</br>
