<br>Title: Innovation, Uncertainty and Instrument Choice for Climate Policy</br><br>Author: Thomas Rutherford, 4829 Northgate Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48103, United States, tom@mpsge.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christoph Böhringer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Climate change is a long-term problem. Efficient policy responses involve the choice of policy instruments and their timing. We present an intertemporal framework where we can study the trade-off between emission taxes and innovation (R&D) subsidies as a means to cope with long-term emission constraints. A stochastic programming setting allows us to investigate how policy choices are affected by uncertainties on the future availability of clean energy technologies.</br>
