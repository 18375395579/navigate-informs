<br>Title: Scenario Generation for Building Operations and Investment</br><br>Author: Kjetil Midthun, SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway, Kjetil.Midthun@sintef.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Adrian Tobias Werner, Michal Kaut</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In a modern setting, consumers can take a more active role in controlling their energy usage. It is challenging to find efficient solutions in terms of economy and energy given the substantial uncertainty that are present both on the short-term and the long-term. Some of these uncertain parameters can be represented in scenario trees. We propose a scenario tree with a hybrid structure that address both long and short term uncertainty within the same framework.</br>
