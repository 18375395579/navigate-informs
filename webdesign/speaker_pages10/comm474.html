<br>Title: Attacker-defender Games with Partially-concave-partially-convex (PC^2) Contest Success Functions</br><br>Author: Peiqiu Guan, PhD Student, University at Buffalo, 338 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, peiqiugu@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jun Zhuang, Stephen Hora</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: When the defense and attack efforts are continuous, contest success functions (CSFs) are used to model the probability of a successful attack as a function of the defender and the attacker investment. Most CSFs in the literature assume diminishing marginal returns, which may not hold in practice when the investments are small. We use a class of partially-concave-partially-convex CSFs to model such “warm-up?effects, and study the impact of such effects on equilibrium attack and defense efforts.</br>
