<br>Title: Renewable Energy Supply Chain Design under Oligopolistic Competition and Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Zhaomiao Guo, University of California-Davis, Dept. Civil & Environment Eng., Davis, CA, 95616, United States of America, zmguo@ucdavis.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yueyue Fan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we model the renewable energy supply chain network problem involving oligopolistic firms, who are competing for resources, transmission capacity, and demand market. The decision variables include the production quantities and capacities of energy infrastructures. The non-corporative market behavior is captured by equilibrium conditions.  Uncertainties in supply and demand are addressed by stochastic programming techniques.</br>
