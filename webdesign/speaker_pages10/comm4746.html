NG market comprises several usages of this commodity, as energy generation and supplying contracts. Moreover, in an integrated company, all activities are interconnected, from gas extraction to its distribution and decision must take into account uncertainties on the demand level and gas prices. We model and solve this problem as a two-stage stochastic program.</br>
