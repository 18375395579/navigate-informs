<br>Title: Multi-scale Stochastic Optimization for Integrating Wind Simulation</br><br>Author: Suvrajeet Sen, Professor, University of Southern California, Epstein Department of ISE, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, sen.22@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victor Zavala, Harsha Gangammanavar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a stochastic optimization model in which decisions for wind generation are implemented at a far greater pace than those for thermal units.  This multi-scale model adopts a combination of approximate dynamic programming and stochastic decomposition (ADP/SD) to accommodate the different time-scales.  Our computational results are based on injecting wind simulations into the ADP/SD algorithm.</br>
