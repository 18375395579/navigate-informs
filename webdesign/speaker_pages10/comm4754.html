<br>Title: Optimal Replacement of Wind Turbines under Uncertainty: A Multiple Lag Real Options Approach</br><br>Author: Michail Chronopoulos, Norwegian School of Economics, Oslo, Norway, Michail.Chronopoulos@nhh.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Afzal S. Siddiqui, Johannes Mauritzen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We address the problem of optimal replacement of wind turbines taking into account electricity price as well as technological uncertainty. By casting this problem as a real options problem with multiple lagged investments, we illustrate not only how policy uncertainty impacts the optimal timing of wind turbine replacement, but also how it affects the type of wind turbines being replaced by allowing policy uncertainty to be endogenously related to technological innovation.</br>
