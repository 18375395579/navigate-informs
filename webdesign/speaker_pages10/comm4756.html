<br>Title: Macro-level Hybrid Energy Planning Model with Intermittent Renewable Sources -India Case Study</br><br>Author: Ayse Selin Kocaman, Graduate Research Assistant, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, 918 S. W. Mudd Hall, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, ask2170@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tim Huh, Vijay Modi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Fast depleting fossils fuels and their environmental hazards increase the importance of renewable sources for sustainable energy planning. However, renewables are intermittent and heavily dependent on spatial location. Here, we address the problem of modeling hydro and solar energy production and allocation, including storage and long-term investments, capturing the uncertainty in the hourly supply and demand data. Model is applied to India which has significant solar and hydropower potential.</br>
