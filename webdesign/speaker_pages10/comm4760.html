<br>Title: Selecting Land Preserves to Enable Species Migration</br><br>Author: Jorge Sefair, PhD Student, University of Florida, Dept. of Industrial & Systems Eng., Gainesville, FL, United States of America, j.sefair@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Miguel Acevedo, Robert Fletcher, J. Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a problem in which a species migrates randomly among a network of patches across some region.  Development on these patches negatively influences the probability that an organism survives when it moves to a patch, and if a critical set of patches is selected for development, the survival of the species becomes threatened.  Our research presents a three-stage optimization model for optimally protecting patches so that the worst-case impact of land development is mitigated.</br>
