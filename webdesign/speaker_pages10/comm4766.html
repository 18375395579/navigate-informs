<br>Title: Cost-effective and Robust Strategies for Nonstructural Flood Risk Reduction in Coastal Louisiana</br><br>Author: David Johnson, RAND Corporation, 1776 Main St, P.O. Box 2138, Santa Monica, CA, 90407, United States of America, djohnson@rand.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jordan Fischbach</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Louisiana’s 2012 Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast allocates $10.2B for nonstructural risk reduction measures like elevating homes and floodproofing commercial properties. Under this funding constraint, we have estimated the maximum potential for nonstructural risk reduction and the performance of various implementation plans across the coast. Pseudo-optimization is used to find cost-effective strategies; we also explore robustness to future environmental and economic uncertainties.</br>
