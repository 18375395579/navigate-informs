<br>Title: Equity Default Swaps under the Jump to Default extended Constant Elasticity of Variance (JDCEV)</br><br>Author: Rafael Mendoza, PhD Student, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Rd. Room C151, Evanston, IL, 60208-3119, United States of America, rafaelmendoza2008@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vadim Linetsky</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: An Equity Default Swap (EDS) provides protection in case of default and in case of a large drop in the stock price of the reference firm. The credit event of an EDS is better defined and provides higher spreads than a CDS. We price the EDS as a contingent claim written on a defaultable stock using the JDCEV process, where default occurs either by diffusion or by a jump to default. We solve the first passage time problem to compute the EDS spreads and compare them to the equivalent CDS spreads.</br>
