<br>Title: Systemic Risk in Asset-investor Networks</br><br>Author: Garud Iyengar, Professor, Columbia University, IEOR Dept., New York, NY, United States of America, garud@ieor.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ciamac Moallemi, Chen Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we will present a model that explores systemic risk in asset-investor networks. The source of systemic risk in our model is contagion via the endogenous price that is determined by the trades of the investors coupled with the market clearing. We identify two different mechanism for this contagion -- the first is the wealth effect, and the second is a portfolio re-balance effect.</br>
