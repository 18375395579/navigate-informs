<br>Title: Hedging Year-End Downside Risk in Global Tactical Asset Allocation</br><br>Author: Gerd Infanger, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, infanger@stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Institutional investors are often concerned with controlling the downside risk at the end of a (fiscal) year as losses incurred at the end of a year determine the risk budget for investments in the following year. We show how dynamic asset allocation can be used to control the downside risk at year-end and analyze the cost and benefits of such management in the context of global tactical asset allocation.</br>
