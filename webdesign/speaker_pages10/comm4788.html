<br>Title: Probabilistic n-K Security Criterion with Significant Renewable Energy Resources Generation</br><br>Author: David Pozo, Pontificia  Universidad  Católica  de  Chile, Avenue Vicuña Mackenna # 4860, Santiago, Chile, davidpozocamara@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Javier Contreras</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a new approach for the joint energy and reserves scheduling and unit commitment with n-K reliability constraints for the day-ahead market. The proposed method includes an n-K criterion where demand must be met with a specified probability under any simultaneous loss of K generating units. A chance-constrained method is proposed to determine the confidence level to meet the demand under K simultaneous contingencies. The effect of increasing renewable penetration is analyzed.</br>
