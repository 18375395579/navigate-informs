<br>Title: Energy Technologies Evaluated Against Climate Targets</br><br>Author: Jessika Trancik, Assistant Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States of America, trancik@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Morgan Edwards, Mandira Roy</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research compares the dynamic performance of energy technologies to climate targets. We propose new, forward-looking metrics to evaluate the mitigation potential of energy supply technologies. When applied to technology evaluation, these dynamic metrics reveal new insights on the relative performance of candidate technologies. We show how these metrics can be used to optimize technology portfolios despite inherent uncertainty about future technology performance and climate constraints.</br>
