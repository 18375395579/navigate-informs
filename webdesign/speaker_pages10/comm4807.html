<br>Title: Approximating Knapsack Sets</br><br>Author: Daniel Bienstock, Department of IEOR, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, United States, dano@ieor.columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: National-scale blackouts are complex phenomena arising from the interaction of combinatorial features of large-scale networks and the physics of power transmission.  In this talk we present continuing work on integer programming and combinatorial problems arising in this context, in particular, the attach problem.</br>
