<br>Title: Heuristic Optimization of Biofuels Production Scenarios That Meet U.S. Renewable Fuel Standards</br><br>Author: David Johnson, RAND Corporation, 1776 Main St, P.O. Box 2138, Santa Monica, CA, 90407, United States of America, djohnson@rand.org</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard specifies that 36 billion gallons of liquid fuels from renewable sources be used annually by 2022. Its success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions depends upon many factors determining the life cycle emissions of biofuels. Using the Calculating Uncertainty in Biomass Emissions model, we present production scenarios that maximize emissions reductions and discuss how the efficient frontier changes when considering multiple criteria like land use change.</br>
