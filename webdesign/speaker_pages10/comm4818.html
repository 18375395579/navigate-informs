<br>Title: A Simulation and Stochastic Programming Approach to Resource Deployment for Wildfire Containment</br><br>Author: Lewis Ntaimo, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University, 3131 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, ntaimo@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ewelina Zwierzykowski</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a simulation and stochastic programming approach to wildfire suppression resource deployment under uncertainty. Simulation is used to generate scenarios of daily fire occurrence and growth. These are input to a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model to determine the mix of resources to deploy to bases in the first stage, and resources from each base to dispatch to a reported fire in the second stage. The objective is to minimize expected cost plus net value change.</br>
