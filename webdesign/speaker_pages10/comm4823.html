<br>Title: Price vs Quantity Regulation for Price Setting Firms</br><br>Author: Cristian Figueroa, Operations Research Center Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave. Bldg. E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, cfiguero@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xin Chen, David Simchi-Levi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In a market producing an externality requiring regulation, we analyze two methods: Pigovian tax and quotas sold for the externality. We show equivalence in a deterministic setting with full information. When demand uncertainty is introduced, we characterize equilibria. Under linear demand and quadratic costs,  we show that equilibria inducing the same average price and average emissions, have different outcomes in terms of profits for the producers as well as revenue for the regulator.</br>
