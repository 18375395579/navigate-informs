<br>Title: Optimizing Network Infrastructure Service Recovery</br><br>Author: Timothy Matisziw, Professor, University of Missouri, Department of Civil & Environmental Eng, Columbia, MO, 65211, United States of America, matisziw.1@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Murray</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Reestablishing functionality to network infrastructure following a damaging event is an essential component of any disaster recovery plan. However, necessary repairs can be costly and time consuming, and recovery efforts need to be prioritized to ensure repairs take place as efficiently as possible. This paper details a multi-objective spatial optimization approach for prioritizing recovery efforts with respect to budgetary and scheduling constraints.</br>
