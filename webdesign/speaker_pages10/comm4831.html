<br>Title: Recent Advancements in the Use of MIP in ISOs</br><br>Author: Richard O'Neill, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First St NE, Washington, DC, 20426, United States of America, Richard.ONeill@ferc.gov</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Unit commitment is a core function of all electricity systems. The associated economic dispatch is a critical element of organized electricity markets. A bid-based-security-constrained-economic-dispatch  including unit commitment is an optimization problem with an additional condition that some of the variables must take binary values, a mixed-integer program (MIP).  This integer requirement presents issues of computational difficulty, economic interpretation and pricing, The MIP has been long been recognized as a powerful modeling paradigm for  electricity markets, but historically hard to solve.   Over the last  decade, in addition to increased performance for computer hardware, the performance of solution algorithms has improved dramatically. Explicit unit commitment through a full MIP is now being used in some ISOs real-time day-ahead markets and other forward markets. It is being  tested or scheduled for introduction in other ISOs.   We present the  early benefits of obtaining better solutions, how to improve bid functions, for example, for combined cycle plants and forbidden zones.  We also present new market designs such as those that allow transmission switching and the implications for energy and reserve pricing.</br>
