<br>Title: Modeling Impact of Natural Disasters on Power System Reliability Using Markov Cut-Set Approach</br><br>Author: Yong Liu, Ph.D. Student, Texas A&M University, Lincoln Ave 313 Apt 134, College Station, TX, 77840, United States of America, liuy0004@neo.tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chanan Singh</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In the environment of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, modeling and evaluation of power system reliability, considering the interdependence with other infrastructure systems, is a challenging task. We are investigating OPF-based Markov Cut Set method to achieve this goal. The proposed approach has been implemented in modified IEEE Reliability Test System. The application cases demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and efficient.</br>
