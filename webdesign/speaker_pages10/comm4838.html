<br>Title: Power Line Control Strategies under Different Tail Distributions of Ambient Temperature</br><br>Author: Juan Li, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, jl3035@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Bienstock, Jose Blanchet</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We discuss a control scheme for maintaining low failure probability of a transmission system power line under thermal stress. When the distribution of the ambient temperature changes, so does the dependence of the failure probability as a function of line current. The theory of extremes of Gaussian random fields is used to guide the size of the underlying frequency inspection so as to insure that current is effective for controlling the risk of overheating.</br>
