<br>Title: Optimization of Real Options: Structural Estimation of Switching Costs in Peak Power Plants</br><br>Author: Stein-Erik Fleten, Professor, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Industrial Economics and Technology Mgm, Alfred Getz v 3, Trondheim, NO-7491, Norway, stein-erik.fleten@iot.ntnu.no</br><br>Coauthor(s): Knut-Harald Bakke, Jon Ragnar Viggen, Erik Haugom, Carl Ullrich</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the real options to shutdown, startup and abandon gas fired power plants. The plants?status for a given year is reported to the US Energy Information Administration as either operating, in standby or retired. We use a stochastic two-factor model for the spark spread process, and estimate the irreversible costs of switching by structural estimation. The proposed nonlinear optimization analysis also indicates the spark spread triggers and option values for the switching decisions.</br>
