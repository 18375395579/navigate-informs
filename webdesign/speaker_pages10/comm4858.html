<br>Title: Efficient Monte Carlo Methods for Convex Risk Measures in Portfolio Credit Risk Models</br><br>Author: Stefan Weber, Assistant Professor, School of OR&IE, Cornell University, 279 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, sweber@orie.cornell.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We discuss efficient Monte Carlo methods for the estimation of convex risk measures in portfolio credit risk models. These risk measures do not share the deficiencies of the current industry standard Value at Risk (VaR). In the present paper we demonstrate that importance sampling with an exponential twist can be used to construct numerically efficient estimators within the framework of the credit risk models CreditRisk+ and CreditMetrics.</br>
