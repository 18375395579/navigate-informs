<br>Title: Assessing Potential Electricity R&D Projects in the Context of Climate Change</br><br>Author: Erin Baker, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, 220 Elab, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States, edbaker@ecs.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeffrey Keisler</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We will present the results of expert assessments on specific climate change technologies that probabilistically relate focused R&D expenditures to specific technological advances. We analyze a limited number of electricity sector technologies which are candidates for investment, including technologies in the categories of advanced solar, carbon capture and sequestration, nuclear fission and fusion, bio-energy, wind, transmission and the grid, and combustion.</br>
