<br>Title: Long-Term Capacity Expansion with Endogenous Real-Time Pricing and Demand Response</br><br>Author: Andrew Liu, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, andrewliu@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jingjie Xiao</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a multiscale modeling framework, based on approximate dynamic programming, that combines long-term capacity expansion and short-term operation of an electric power grid.  In the short-term, real-time retail pricing (RTP) is integrated with the grid-level economic dispatch, and demand response (DR) is realized through smart-grid-aided control automation. We will present numerical results to show the impacts of RTP and DR on capacity mix, economic surplus, and system-level emissions.</br>
