<br>Title: Coco, Bail-in and Tail Risk</br><br>Author: Nan Chen, Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, Hong Kong - PRC, nchen@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Glasserman, Behzad Nouri</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a capital structure model to analyze the incentives created by contingent convertibles (Cocos) and bail-in debt, two variants of debt that converts to equity as a bank nears or reaches financial distress. Our model combines endogeous default, debt rollover, and jump risks. We find that Cocos generally have positive incentive effects when the conversion trigger is not set too low.</br>
