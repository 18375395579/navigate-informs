<br>Title: Custom Power Contract Portfolio Optimization with CVAR Constraints</br><br>Author: Roy Kwon, Prof, University fo Toronto, 5 Kings College Rd., Toronto, ON, Canada, kwon@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Scott Rogers, Sheena Yau</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers a stochastic IP model that jointly considers the problem of selecting custom contracts and finding the optimal procurement strategy of meeting contract obligations under spot price uncertainty. We use a two stage stochastic programming model with CVAR constraints.  It will be shown that the CVAR model will allow acceptance of contracts at lower prices compared to the risk-neutral model as a hedge against mis-specified arbitrage.</br>
