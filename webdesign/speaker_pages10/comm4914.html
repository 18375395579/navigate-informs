<br>Title: Dynamic Competition in Electricity Markets</br><br>Author: Talat Genc, Asst. Professor, University of Guelph, Department of Economics, Guelph, On, Canada, tgenc@uoguelph.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study dynamic competition between hydro and thermal generators under demand uncertainty. Two versions of the model are analyzed: an infinite-horizon game with fixed capacity and a finite-horizon in which thermal generator can invest in capacity. We find that duopoly is nearly efficient, and duopoly prices are too smooth. We also find that investment is higher under closed-loop information than under S-adapted open-loop information.</br>
