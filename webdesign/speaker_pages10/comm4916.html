<br>Title: Comparison of Approaches to Untraded Asset Valuation</br><br>Author: Steve Derby, sgderby@pacbell.net</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ross Shachter</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine a range of approaches for the valuation of uncertain cash flows from untraded assets, with trading opportunities in a no-arbitrage market.  Traditional decision analytic valuation does not exploit market opportunities and provides a lower bound.  Standard financial option theory imposes conditions of completeness and provides an upper bound.</br>
