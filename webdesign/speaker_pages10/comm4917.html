<br>Title: A Mixed Integer Programming Approach for Cybersecurity Risk Planning</br><br>Author: Tadeusz Sawik, Professor, AGH University of Science & Technology, Al.Mickiewicza 30, Krakow, 30059, Poland, ghsawik@cyf-kr.edu.pl</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Using a mixed integer programming with CVaR as a risk measure, a subset of available countermeasures is selected for implementation under limited budget, to minimize  the expected and/or worst-case losses from successful cyber-attacks. The effectiveness of countermeasures for blocking different cyber-threats and the probability of potential attack scenarios are considered.</br>
