<br>Title: Coordination Mechanisms in Forest Value Chains</br><br>Author: Sophie D'Amours, Universit?Laval, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pavillon Adrien Pouliot, Québec, QC, G1K 7P4, Canada, sophie.damours@forac.ulaval.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mikael Ronnqvist</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Logistic planning is often based on decoupled planning of several independent problems. In these cases, there is a need to introduce coordination mechanisms to find the best solution for the entire chain. We explore a number of planning problems and describe efficient coordination mechanisms based on different decomposition strategies.</br>
