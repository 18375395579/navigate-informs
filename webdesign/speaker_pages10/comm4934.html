<br>Title: Dynamic Programming Based Mechanism for Energy Aware Scheduling</br><br>Author: Rodrigo Carrasco, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, 313A S. W. Mudd Building, New York City, NY, 10027, United States of America, rac2159@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Garud Iyengar, Cliff Stein</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Controlling power consumption in the context of scheduling is fast becoming a very important research problem. Here we present new dynamic programming based mechanisms for energy aware scheduling in which our objective is to minimize the sum of the total weighted completion time and the total energy consumption of the jobs processed.</br>
