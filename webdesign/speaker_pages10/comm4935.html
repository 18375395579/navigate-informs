<br>Title: Application of Bayesian Network for Hazard-based Risk Modeling in Aviation Safety Management System</br><br>Author: Ohhoon Kwon, graduate student, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseo, Daejeon, 305-701, Korea, Republic of, ohunkwon@kaist.ac.kr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yoonjin Yoon</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Risk modeling is the key to achieve proactive aviation safety management. This study presents application of Bayesian network for hazard-based risk modeling. Bayesian network constructed from historical aviation safety data identifies the relationship among hazards, occurrences, and consequences and provides the conditional probabilities. The model can assess risks that potentially result in accidents or incidents given hazards, or in reverse, identify hazards given occurrences or consequences.</br>
