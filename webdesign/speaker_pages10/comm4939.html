<br>Title: Joint Merchant Management of Natural Gas Storage and Transport Assets</br><br>Author: Selvaprabu Nadarajah, PhD Candidate, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, snadaraj@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicola Secomandi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Natural gas pipeline systems embed storage and transport assets. The current literature has studied the management of these assets as separate real options. In contrast, we consider their joint merchant management. We develop near optimal approximate dynamic programming methods for the resulting Markov decision problem, leveraging our structural analysis of this model optimal value function and policy, and apply them to realistic instances to answer managerial questions.</br>
