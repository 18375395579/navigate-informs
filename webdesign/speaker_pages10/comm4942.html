<br>Title: Mitigation Assessment of Water Supply Systems for Insufficient Fire Flows A Multi-objective Approach</br><br>Author: Lufthansa Kanta, Graduate Assistant Teaching, Texas A&M University, College Station, 603 Southwest Parkway, Apt. 32, College Station, TX, 77840, United States of America, lufthansa_kanta@neo.tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Emily Zechman, Kelly Brumbelow</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Effective mitigation strategies for urban fire events for water distribution systems (WDS) are developed using an evolutionary multiobjective optimization-simulation framework. An elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is applied with a little modification. The objectives considered are minimizing fire damages, minimizing water quality deficiencies, and minimizing the cost of mitigation. A set of Pareto-optimal solutions is generated to understand the trade-offs between the objectives.</br>
