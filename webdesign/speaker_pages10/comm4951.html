<br>Title: Semantic Service Contracts and Extended Enterprise</br><br>Author: A Salam, Associate Professor, UNCG, 479 Bryan School, Greensboro, NC, 27402, United States of America, amsalam@uncg.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Communication, coordination and other problems arise due to the use of different terms and concepts (and their underlying lack of common semantics or meaning) used in the description of service contracts. This research is motivated by this critical problem of stark incompatibility between the contractual clauses (typically buried in legal documents) and the myriad of service performance measures for participants in the extended enterprise.</br>
