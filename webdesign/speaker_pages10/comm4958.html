<br>Title: Pricing Lease Contracts with Options in an Imperfect Market of Durable-Goods</br><br>Author: Suzhou Huang, Ford Motor Company, Research & Innovation Center, Dearborn, MI, 48121, United States of America, shuang10@ford.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop a game theoretical model to value lease contracts with options in an imperfect market of durable-goods. The economic environment of our model differs sharply from that of the standard approach in corporate finance. We illustrate the dual roles of the lease contract with options: price discrimination of heterogeneous consumers and hedge of uncertain residual values of off-lease goods.</br>
