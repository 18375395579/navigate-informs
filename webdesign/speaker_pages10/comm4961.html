<br>Title: Packaging Energy and Reserves Bids in Co-optimized Multi-period Power Markets</br><br>Author: Uday Shanbhag, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 206 Transportation Building, Urbana, IL, United States of America, udaybag@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lindsay Anderson, Kyoungwon Kang, Judith Cardell</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We examine the role of risk-based penalties in developing alternate market designs in which firms may combine energy bids associated with uncertain real-time availability with stable reserves bids. Such a framework is motivated by the reliability concerns associated with integrating volatile supply-side assets. Numerics on a 6-firm network illustrate the utility of such avenues.</br>
