<br>Title: Pricing American Options and Finding Optimal Exercise Boundary via Linear Programming</br><br>Author: Nikita Boyko, PhD Student, University of Florida, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 303 Weil Hall, PO Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, nikita@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stan Uryasev, Panos Pardalos</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We suggest an optimization based approach to find both the price of an American option contract and its optimal exercise boundary. The trading universe is modeled on a discrete grid where each node is connected to a time point and a price of underlying security. Such a representation allows us reducing the problem to the computationally efficient linear program. We performed a series of numerical experiments to compare with existing methods.</br>
