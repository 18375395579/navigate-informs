<br>Title: Capacity Investment in Electricity Markets: Perfect Competition</br><br>Author: Gul Gurkan, Associate Professor, Tilburg University, Warandelaan 2, Tilburg, 5037 AB, Netherlands, ggurkan@uvt.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yves Smeers, Ozge Ozdemir</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze investment choices of firms using a two-stage game; capacities are installed in stage one and production takes place in an energy-only market at stage two. Under deterministic demand, we show equivalence of the two-stage game and a single  optimization problem. Under demand uncertainty, we essentially have a two-stage stochastic game and an equilibrium point can be found by solving a two-stage stochastic program.
