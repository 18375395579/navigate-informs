<br>Title: Understanding Behaviors of Owners of Interdependent Infrastructure Systems to Improve Reliability</br><br>Author: Allison Reilly, Post-doctoral Research Fellow, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 N. Charles Street, Ames Hall, Baltimore, MD, 21218, United States of America, allison.reilly@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seth Guikema, Andrew Samuel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Increasing emphasis on interdependent infrastructure networks has provided a better understanding of their physical vulnerabilities. However, there has been little discussion on the behavior of infrastructure owners and how their decisions affect dependent systems?reliability. In this work, we develop a game-theoretic model to explore how owners make investment decisions and how to provide third-party incentives to improve overall network reliability.</br>
