<br>Title: Operational Models with Risk Hedging Constraints</br><br>Author: Rene Caldentey, Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, NY, rcaldent@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Martin Haugh, Leon Valdes</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing the profits of a corporation when these profits depend in part on movements in the financial markets and/or economic indices.  We propose a methodology for the optimal selection of dynamic operating and financial hedging strategies when the decision maker is risk averse. Risk aversion is imposed through  constraints on the feasible policies.  We identify circumstances in operational and financial decisions can be effectively decoupled.</br>
