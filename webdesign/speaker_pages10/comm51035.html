<br>Title: Coordination in a Multi-retailer Distribution System: Supplier-facilitated Transshipments</br><br>Author: Rong Li, SMU, 50 Stamford Road, Singapore, Singapore, rongli@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhi Zeng, Jennifer Ryan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a two-period production and inventory distribution problem  in which transshipments, reactive and proactive, among independent retailers occur in the second period. We propose and examine a new coordination scheme: supplier-facilitated transshipments, implemented via a bi-directional adjustment contract, offered by the supplier to each retailer.  We show that coordination can be achieved; a unique state-dependent adjustment (or transshipment) price must be used for coordination.</br>
