<br>Title: Knowledge Work in Supply Chain Innovation Alliances: Technological Uncertainty as Inhibitor?</br><br>Author: Ricarda Bouncken, Prof., University of Bayreuth, Prieserstr. 2, Bayreuth, 95444, Germany, bouncken@uni-bayreuth.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robin Pesch</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Supply chain innovation alliances originally set up to improve effectiveness are today increasingly used for idea generation and new product creation. This study based on a sample of 418 firms delivers insights on how knowledge transfer and knowledge combination affect the joint knowledge creation and new product superiority in supply chain innovation alliances. We further provide insights how the knowledge work across supply chain partners is influenced by growing technological uncertainty.</br>
