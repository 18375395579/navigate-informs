<br>Title: Supply Risk, Information Asymmetry, and Backup Production Option</br><br>Author: Zhibin (Ben) Yang, PhD Candidate, Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, zhibiny@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Volodymyr Babich, Goker Aydin, Damian Beil</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a one-period model in which the supplier is subject to random disruptions. The probability of a disruption, high or low, is known to the supplier but not to the buyer. In case of a disruption, the supplier either pays a penalty or uses a backup production source to meet the order. We derive the buyer’s optimal contract, find that it may penalize the less reliable supplier while forcing the more reliable supplier to use the backup source, and compute the cost of information asymmetry.</br>
