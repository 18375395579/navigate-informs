<br>Title: Optimal Supplier Contracts Under Asymmetric Inventory Information</br><br>Author: Hao Zhang, Assistant Professor, University of Southern California, 3670 Trousdale Parkway, Bridge Hall 401G, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, zhanghao@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mahesh Nagarajan, Greys Sosic</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a model in which a single supplier sells to a single retailer who faces stochastic demand and follows periodic review. We assume that the initial inventory and subsequent demand realizations are known to the retailer but unobservable by the supplier. Adopting the principal agent paradigm, we model the supplier's problem as a constrained optmization problem and characterize its optimal contract. Further, we compare the performances of the optimal contracts with some simpler contracts.</br>
