<br>Title: Contract Design for Multi-sourcing Service</br><br>Author: Alan Scheller-Wolf, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, awolf@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ying Xu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Multi-sourcing is becoming increasingly popular in service industries, but prior work has paid limited attention to multi-sourcing management via contracts in service sectors. We build a queueing model in which a client firm outsources to two self-interested service providers, whose capacity decisions are influenced by the payment schemes offered by the client firm. We compare various performance-based payment schemes under different multi-sourcing structures.</br>
