<br>Title: Approximate Evaluation of Order Fill Rates for an Inventory System of Service Tools</br><br>Author: Ingrid Vliegen, Ph.D Student, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Postbus 513, Pav E18, Eindhoven, 5600 MB, Netherlands, I.M.H.Vliegen@tm.tue.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Geert-Jan van Houtum</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we deal with the analysis of a single-location, multi-item inventory model for service tools, in which coupled demands and coupled returns occur. We distinguish multiple Poisson demand streams. Per stream a given set of tools is requested per demand. We are interested in the order fill rates. Requested tools that are not on stock are delivered via an emergency channel. Delivered tools are returned to the warehouse after a deterministic return time, that is equal for all tools.</br>
