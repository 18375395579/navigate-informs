<br>Title: Effectiveness of Transfer Pricing Strategies in Multinational Supply Chains with Random Demands</br><br>Author: Srinagesh Gavirneni, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, sg337@johnson.cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Masha Shunko, Xiaohang Yue</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: For companies that have supply chains spanning many countries with differing tax rates, transfer pricing is a popular strategy to reduce their tax burden. There has been limited research on this topic for supply chains with random components. We analyze supply chains from an operations management standpoint (considering random demands, capacity issues,  and multiple products), determine optimal transfer pricing strategies and analyze their effect for a wide variety of parameter settings.</br>
