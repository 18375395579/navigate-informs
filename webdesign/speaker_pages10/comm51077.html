<br>Title: Effect of Product Substitution and Unavailability Correlation on Mitigating Supply Chain Disruptions</br><br>Author: Mengshi Lu, Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Shunde Building Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China, lmd03@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Simin Huang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Enabling product substitution can be an effective way of mitigating supply chain disruptions. However, since substitutable products may share more components in common, they are more likely to be unavailable simultaneously, which impairs the effect. We studied a system with two substitutable products subject to correlated random supply disruptions. We showed the effect of product substitution in terms of reducing lost sales and the value of decoupling the supply of substitutable products.</br>
