<br>Title: Supply Uncertainty and the Reverse Bullwhip Effect</br><br>Author: Ying Rong, Post-Doc, University of California, Berkeley, IEOR, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, yir204@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Max Shen, Lawrence V. Snyder</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We postulate the existence of a reverse bullwhip effect (RBWE) that occurs in the presence of supply uncertainty. Whereas the classical bullwhip effect (BWE) describes an increase in demand/order volatility as one moves upstream in the supply chain, the RBWE describes the opposite.  Our model is based on the rationing game discussed by Lee, et al. (1997); we show that the RBWE occurs in this setting and reconcile this observation with Lee, et al.'s result that the BWE occurs instead.</br>
