<br>Title: Service Dynamics under Repeated Interactions</br><br>Author: Sam Aflaki, PhD Candidate, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, Sam.AFLAKI@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ioana Popescu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We model a dynamic service relationship where the provider can adjust the service level in each period and customers decide to renew the service contract based on previous experiences and future expectations. We characterize the firm's optimal strategies under various customer behavior models. In particular, we consider the effect of gain/loss asymmetry on (a) the evolution of overall perception of service quality and (b) the decision making process for the renewal of the service contract.</br>
