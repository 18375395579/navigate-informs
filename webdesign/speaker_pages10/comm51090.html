<br>Title: Dynamic Model of Quality-based Competition between Suppliers</br><br>Author: Joline Uichanco, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, uichanco@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi, Georgia Perakis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In many industries, it is critical that suppliers provide components that meet a quality standard. We study two suppliers that use quality to compete for a contract over a time horizon. The contract is awarded based on the relative quality offered by the suppliers. The more contracts the supplier wins, the more likely it will produce components at a low cost at the next period. We model this problem as a stochastic game and suggest allocation schemes that will result in high quality components.</br>
