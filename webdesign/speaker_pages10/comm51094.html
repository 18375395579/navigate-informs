<br>Title: Analysis of Disruption Risks in a Food Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Monika Weishaeupl, Research Assistant, Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, Nordbergstr. 15, Vienna, AT, 1090, Austria, monika.weishaeupl@wu-wien.ac.at</br><br>Coauthor(s): Heidrun Rosic, Werner Jammernegg</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the disruption risks in a food supply chain where raw material is perishable and only available during a limited time period but the final product is a durable good. Using dynamic process simulation we analyze alternative strategies for mitigating the impacts of disruption risks with respect to cost and service level. Examples of strategies are decentralization of production and warehousing and other sourcing options.</br>
