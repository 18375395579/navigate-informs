<br>Title: Beating the Accuracy Trap: Overinvestment in Demand Forecasting and Supply Chain Coordination</br><br>Author: Hyoduk Shin, Ph.D Candidate, Stanford University, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, hshin@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tunay Tunca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study supply chain coordination with investment in demand forecasting. We show that common pricing schemes suffer from overinvestment in forecasting.  We demonstrate that wholesale price and two-part tariff scheme can result in full loss of efficiency, and explore the determinants of the levels of inefficiency in investment and surplus. We also propose a contracting scheme that utilizes market interaction and solves important implementation problems in addition to achieving full coordination.</br>
