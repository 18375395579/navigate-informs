<br>Title: Long Term Contracts Under the Threat of Supplier Failure</br><br>Author: Robert Swinney, Doctoral Student, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, rswinney@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Serguei Netessine</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We address the issue of how to contract with suppliers facing the threat of failure when the probability of failure is directly influenced by contract terms (e.g., price and length of contract).  We model this dynamic through a two period contracting game with two suppliers, a single buyer, and uncertain production costs. We determine when it is optimal to commit to a long-term relationship, and how this decision is affected by suppliers under the threat of failure.</br>
