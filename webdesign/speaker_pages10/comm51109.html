<br>Title: Yield Management in Agricultural Markets</br><br>Author: Kwan Eng Wee, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management Univesity, 50 Stamford Road #04-01, Singapore, 178899, Singapore, kewee@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Onur Boyabatli</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers a processor who has to decide on the sourcing options for an agricultural input in the face of farm yield uncertainty of that input. The input can be sourced from farmers on a long-term contract basis in advance, or through an open market on the day.  The processors can also use different pricing schemes on the output side to hedge against the yield uncertainty. Our work studies the impacts of these options on the processor’s operations and performance.</br>
