<br>Title: When Gray Markets Have Silver Linings: All-unit Discounts, Gray Markets and Channel Management</br><br>Author: Michael Pavlin, Assistant Professor, Wilfrid Laurier University, 75 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, Canada, Michael.Pavlin06@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ming Hu, Mengze Shi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study unauthorized distribution channels (gray markets) caused by a reseller's response to a supplier's all-unit quantity discount. We perform a closed-form analysis of the reseller's optimal pricing, inventory and gray market diversion decisions. We identify conditions where it is optimal for the profit-maximizing supplier to accommodate the gray market.</br>
