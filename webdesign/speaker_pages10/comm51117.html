<br>Title: The Assortment Packing Problem: Multiperiod Assortment Planning for Short-Lived Products</br><br>Author: Victor Martinez de Albeniz, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, Av. Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, valbeniz@iese.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Felipe Caro, Paat Rusmevichientong</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Retailers introduce new items to refresh product lines and maintain their market share. We study how a firm must decide, in advance, the release date of each product in a given collection over a selling season. Our formulation models the trade-offs among profit margins, preference weights, and limited life cycles. A key aspect of the problem is that each product is short-lived in the sense that, once introduced, its attractiveness lasts only a few periods and vanishes over time.</br>
