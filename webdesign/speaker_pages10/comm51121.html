<br>Title: Network Configuration and Capacity Planning in Hybrid Manufacturing/Remanufacturing Systems</br><br>Author: David Francas, University of Mannheim, Schloss, S233, Mannheim, 68131, Germany, francas@bwl.uni-mannheim.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stefan Minner</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing systems with uncertain demand and return where manufacturing and remanufacturing processes are conducted in the same facility or each process is dedicated to separate facilities. With respect to different priorizations of the two processes, we analyze the optimal capacity decisions for both network configurations. Our analysis further demonstrates that shared facilities may be preferred due to the benefits of pooling demand and return risks.</br>
