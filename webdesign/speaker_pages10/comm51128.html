<br>Title: Stock Positioning in the Flu Vaccine Supply Chain: Issues and Implications</br><br>Author: Prashant Yadav, Professor of Supply Chain Management, MIT-Zaragoza Intl Logistics Program, Zaragoza Logistics Center, Avda Gomez Laguna 25, Zaragoza, AR, 50009, Spain, pyadav@zlc.edu.es</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We look at the tradeoffs involved in positioning vaccine stock at the physician's practice vs at the distributor. A scheme where pre-ordered stock is maintained at a centralized location for each healthcare provider and is dispacthed upon appointment scheduling is analyzed. The impacts of such a scheme on cold chain breaks and more efficient distribution are modeled.</br>
