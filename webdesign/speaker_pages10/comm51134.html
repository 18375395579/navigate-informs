<br>Title: Supply Allocation to Maintain Supplier Health in Development-Intensive Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Mericcan Usta, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, Management Science & Engineering, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, usta@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Feryal Erhun, Warren H. Hausman</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the impact of the buyer's financial health and R&D generation concerns on his selection of suppliers in a setting where multiple suppliers compete for a divisible supply of fixed value. We analyze the supply allocation as well as supplier finances in equilibrium in single-period and multiple-period settings. Inclusion of financial health concerns reveals dynamics that have been overlooked in the previous literature on supplier selection.</br>
