<br>Title: Beyond Plug and Play: Alliances in the Software Market</br><br>Author: Ashish Agarwal, 5000 Forbes Avenue, 357 Posner Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, ashish1agarwal@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tridas Mukhopadhyay, Pei-yu Chen</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Consumers in software market can gain additional interaction utility when they buy multiple components that are also compatible. Choice of partners and the magnitude of interaction utility are strategic variables for the component vendors. We evaluate these choices  in an oligopoly market for two components using a game-theoretical setup. We find that the vendors always prefer to have mutually exclusive links with higher interaction utility instead of forming links with all the vendors.</br>
