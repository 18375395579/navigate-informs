<br>Title: Promotion Optimization for Grocery Retailers</br><br>Author: Georgia Perakis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, georgiap@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maxime Cohen, Zachary Leung, Kiran Panchamgam, Andrew Vakhutinsky</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Promotion planning is an important process for retail grocery chains. We formulate the problem of optimizing promotions for products in a category, i.e. deciding which products to promote, using which promotion vehicles, and at what prices. Our demand model captures several key effects that arise in practice (complementary and substitution effects, promotion fatigue). This gives rise to a hard problem. We propose and compare various solution methods for the problem.</br>
