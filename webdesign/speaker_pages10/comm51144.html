<br>Title: Incentives for Transshipment in a Decentralized Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Jing Shao, University of British Columbia, Box 524, 6335 Thunderbird Crescent, Vancouver, BC, V6T 2G9, Canada, jing.shao@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Harish Krishnan, S. Thomas McCormick</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the incentives for transshipment in a decentralized supply chain, where a monopoly manufacturer sells through competing retailers. We find when the wholesale price is endogenous, the manufacturer and retailers?incentives for transhipment depends on the transhipment price. When the transshipment decisions are also endogenous, transhipment may not happen, and whether the manufacturer and retailers benefit from transshipment depends on their control of transshipment decisions.</br>
