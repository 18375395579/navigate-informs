<br>Title: When is  Bundling of Contracts Optimal?</br><br>Author: Qiang Zeng, Shantou University, Business School, Guangdong, China, qzeng@stu.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shivendu Shivendu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: When contracting out a series of sequential activities in which the quality of outcome of earlier activities impacts the cost to the vendor of the subsequent activities, the firm may offer unbundled contracts wherein she contracts for each activity separately and potentially with two different vendors, or offer bundled contracts to one single vendor for both activities.  We study the tradeoffs and examine the optimality of bundling contracts under information asymmetry and uncertainty.</br>
