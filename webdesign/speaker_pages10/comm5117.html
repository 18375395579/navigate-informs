<br>Title: Products with Network Externality: The Relevance of Unbundling and Mixed Bundling</br><br>Author: R. Venkatesh, Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Katz Graduate School of Business, 332 Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States, rvenkat@katz.pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vijay Mahajan, Ashutosh Prasad</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Despite the hype surrounding Microsoft’s decision to bundle Internet Explorer and Windows, we argue that unbundling and mixed bundling can be optimal for products with network externality.  Specifically, we analyze a stylized model to propose normative guidelines on optimal bundling strategies for a profit maximizing seller.  We show that when products have low to moderate network externality, unbundling is better when marginal costs are high.  Mixed bundling is also superior to pure bundling except when the products have strong network externality.</br>
