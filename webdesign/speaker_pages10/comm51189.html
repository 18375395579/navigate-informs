<br>Title: Does Inventory Increase Sales? The Billboard and Scarcity Effect in U.S. Automobile Dealerships</br><br>Author: Santiago Gallino, The Wharton School, 3720 Walnut St, Philadelphia, 19104, United States of America, sgallino@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gerard Cachon, Marcelo Olivares</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Estimating the relationship between inventory and sales is complex for several reasons. One of the main challenges is that inventories are endogenously chosen: inventory levels are chosen by a decision maker in anticipation of sales. To tackle these difficulties we apply a novel procedure to estimate the impact of inventory on sales: We use weather shocks to dealer’s inventories, which are exogenous of managerial decisions, to estimate the impact of inventory on sales.</br>
