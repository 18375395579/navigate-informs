<br>Title: Capacity and Price Competition Under Imperfect Information</br><br>Author: Bing Jing, Assistant Professor of Marketing, Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, Oriental Plaza, 3F, Tower E3, 1 East Chang An Avenue, Beijing, 100738, China, bjing@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuxin Chen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine capacity-then-price competition in a duopoly where some (the remaining) consumers are uninformed (informed) about prices.

The price equilibrium in the first stage is of independent interest.</br>
