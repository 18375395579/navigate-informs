<br>Title: A Sequential Location and Pricing Problem for a Duopoly</br><br>Author: Yue Zhang, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Stree West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, yue.zhang3@mail.mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Saibal Ray, Vedat Verter</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We investigate a sequential location and pricing problem for two profit-maximizing firms, which compete on a unit line market. Each customer purchases one unit of the product from the store providing higher utility. We assume that the early-mover first decides its location as a monopoly, and focus on the optimal location and pricing strategy for the later entrant and the adjusted pricing strategy for the early-mover.</br>
