<br>Title: Competitive Supplier Responsibility and Sourcing Decisions in Decentralized Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Ruixue Guo, Doctoral Student, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, rguo@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hau L. Lee, Robert Swinney</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the responsibility decisions of two suppliers who compete for the business of a single buyer. The suppliers may invest to adhere to social and environmental responsibility standards, reducing the probability of a violation that might negatively impact the buying firm. We examine the equilibrium outcome of this competition and consider its sensitivity to market and supply chain conditions.</br>
