<br>Title: Online Auctions for Market Research on Consumers?Willingness to Pay</br><br>Author: Matthew Potoff, PhD Candidate, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, potoff@bus.umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Damian Beil</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a manufacturer selling a short life-cycle product over a finite selling horizon. The manufacturer is uncertain about consumers?willingness to pay. Initially items are sold via auction and the manufacturer’s priors about willingness to pay are updated. Using a DP approach we explore when the manufacturer should select a price and switch to a mass-market, fixed price channel. Consumer product adoption follows a diffusion process over the horizon.</br>
