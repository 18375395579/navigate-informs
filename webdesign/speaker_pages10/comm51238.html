<br>Title: Dual Channel Management with Service Competition</br><br>Author: Murat Kaya, Assistant Professor, Sabanci University, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci Universitesi MDBF, Tuzla Istanbul, 34956, Turkey, mkaya@sabanciuniv.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozalp Ozer, Kay-Yut Chen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We address a manufacturer's problem of managing its direct online channel together with an independent retail channel. The consumers consider the delivery lead time in the direct channel and product availability in the retail channel in their channel selection. We identify optimal dual channel strategies that depend on the channel environment. We also present an experimental study that investigates whether our analytical model is consistent with human behavior.</br>
