<br>Title: Quality and Information Asymmetry in Service Outsourcing</br><br>Author: Justin Ren, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA, United States of America, ren@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fuqiang Zhang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies how to design service outsourcing contracts with quality consideration and the presence of asymmetric information.  An outsourcer procures a service from a service provider whose cost structure is private information. Our results suggest that outsourcing companies can use relatively simple and yet robust contracts to assure a high level of capacity and quality service even when they do not have perfect information of the service provider.</br>
