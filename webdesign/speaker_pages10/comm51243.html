<br>Title: Value Chain Strategy for Product Development</br><br>Author: Korhan Gurkan, Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, Pittsburgh, United States, kgurkan@cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We explore whether integrating manufacturing and development activities results in more innovation and higher profits across the value chain. While competition between coordinated supply chains has recently been studied in the literature, we study competition both between disintegrated value chains with specialized firms and between integrated value chains.  We also compare the performance of the two value chain structures.</br>
