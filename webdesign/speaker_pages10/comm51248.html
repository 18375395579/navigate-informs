<br>Title: A Dual Supplier Inventory Model with Demand and Supply Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Dogan Serel, Bilkent University, Faculty of Business Administration, Bilkent, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, serel@bilkent.edu.tr</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study an extension of the single-period stochastic demand inventory problem in a dual supplier setting.  The suppliers have different unit costs and supply risks.  The buyer’s problem is to determine the amount to be ordered from each supplier so that his expected profit is maximized. We discuss properties of the optimal solution, and present numerical examples.</br>
