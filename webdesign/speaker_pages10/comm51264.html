<br>Title: The Effect of Entrant Cost Uncertainty in Procurement Auctions</br><br>Author: Brendan See, Ph.D. Candidate, Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, United States of America, bdsee@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Damian Beil, Izak Duenyas</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Although an incumbent supplier may know her cost to produce an item, an entrant supplier is usually less informed.  We model this scenario and allow the entrant to learn additional information at a cost.  The buyer can influence the learning cost.  We study whether the entrant will learn prior to the auction or delay learning and make a less-informed bid.  Further, we evaluate when the buyer will exert effort to lower the entrant’s learning cost.</br>
