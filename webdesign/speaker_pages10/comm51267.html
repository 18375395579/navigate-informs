<br>Title: Information Asymmetry and Quality in Service Outsourcing</br><br>Author: Justin Ren, Assistant Professor, Boston University School of Management, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States, ren@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fuqiang Zhang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider information asymmetry in a one-outsourcer-one-supplier service outsourcing setting.  The supplier sets its capacity level and quality level, and serves the customers of the outsourcer.  Moreover, the outsourcer does not have perfect information about the cost structure of the service provider.   We compare two classes of optimal contracts under this setting: one that is contingent on the cost information, and the other that is non-contingent.</br>
