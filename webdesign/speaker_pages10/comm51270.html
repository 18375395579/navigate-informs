<br>Title: Cooperative Competition in Managing Severe Supply Chain Disruptions</br><br>Author: H. Charles Ralph, Assistant Professor of Management, Clayton State University, School of Business, 2000 Clayton State Blvd, Morrow, GA, 30260, United States of America, CharlesRalph@mail.clayton.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the concept of supply chain disruption and a full-sector response to disruption by normally competing supply chains.  A simulation model is the basis for analyzing the response to disruptions as risk management through the control of variability in supply and demand.  The temporary cooperation of competing chains may lessen the effects of such variability.  Properly managed, benefits accrue to competing supply chains, offsetting some costs and transient windfall profits.</br>
