<br>Title: Coalition Formation among Component Suppliers in Decentralized Assembly Systems</br><br>Author: Shuya Yin, Assistant Professor, University of California, Irvine, Paul Merage School of Business, Irvine, CA, 92697, United States, syin@merage.uci.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies coalition formation among component suppliers in decentralized assembly systems. The stability analysis of coalition structures indicates that coalitions of a very small number of suppliers are often emerging in equilibrium, and that the grand coalition of all suppliers is never stable when the number of suppliers is relatively large. We show that the assembler would always benefit if coalitions are formed among its suppliers.</br>
