<br>Title: Impact of the Unavailability of a Power Unit on Its Forward Contracting</br><br>Author: Salvador Pineda, Univ. Castilla - La Mancha, Campus Universitario s/n, Ciudad Real, 13071, Spain, salvapineda@hotmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antonio J. Conejo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: As a complement of selling in the pool, a power unit engages in forward contracting to hedge against the risk of profit variability due to pool price volatility.   Unavailability of the unit due to its force outage rate results in the need of buying in the pool the contracted energy that cannot be supplied by self-production, which in turn might result in a significant loss and profit variability. This presentation explores how forward contracting is influenced by unit unavailability.</br>
