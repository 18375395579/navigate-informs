<br>Title: Engineering Changes and Quality Spills in Long Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Daniel Reaume, Staff Researcher, General Motors Operations Research, M/C 480-106-155, 30500 Mound Road, Warren, MI, 48090, United States of America, daniel.reaume@gm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bob Bordley</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Long supply chains tend to make engineering changes and quality spills more difficult to manage because disruptions lead to long pipelines of unusable parts.   We present an analytic model of  such disruptions, taking into account production rates, supplier capacity, pipeline length, premium freight and part repairability.</br>
