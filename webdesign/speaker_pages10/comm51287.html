<br>Title: Integrated Optimization of Procurement, Processing and Trade of Commodities</br><br>Author: Sripad Devalkar, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, E0401, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, devalkar@bus.umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ravi Anupindi, Amitabh Sinha</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the integrated optimization for a firm involved in the procurement, processing and trading of commodities. We model risk-aversion using a Value-at-Risk constraint on the total expected profits and derive optimal policies for both risk-neutral and risk-averse firms. We show that the optimal procurement quantity for a risk-averse firm is never greater than that for a risk-neutral firm, while the optimal quantity processed is never lower than that for a risk-neutral firm.</br>
