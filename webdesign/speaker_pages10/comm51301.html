<br>Title: Incentives, Information and Supply Chain Performance</br><br>Author: Taylor Randall, Associate Professor, University of Utah, 201 South Presidents Circle, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, United States, acttr@business.utah.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shoshanah Cohen, Susan Kulp</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This research examines the crucial role of incentives and information sharing in the supply chain.  We posit that greater use of incentives and information will be associated with supply chain performance, but that the effect will be contingent on the organizational structure of the firm.  We test these hypotheses using performance data collected from 37 make-to-stock manufacturing firms.</br>
