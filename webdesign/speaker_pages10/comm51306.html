<br>Title: Effect of Inaccurate Inventory Information Sharing of a Drop-shipper with an Online Retailer</br><br>Author: Taesu Cheong, Assistant Professor, National University of Singapore, ISE Department, 1 Engineering Drive 2, Singapore, 117576, Singapore, isects@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Goh, Sang Hwa Song</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the impact of information discrepancy between a drop-shipper and an online retailer on a drop-shipping supply chain performance, based on a newsvendor framework. Information mismatches between two parties contribute to the failure of complete order fulfillment. We assess the effects of ignoring information discrepancy on the supply chain performance through numerical experiments.</br>
