<br>Title: Quality Competition Under Yield Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Awi Federgruen, Professor, Columbia University, 419 Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, af7@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nan Yang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We characterize the equilibrium behavior in an industry with N potential suppliers with uncertain yields, competing for the business of M buyers, in a single sales season. Suppliers can select (i) the yield reliability, as measured by an appropriately chosen decreasing function of the coefficient of variation of the yield factor, (ii) a yield target, i.e. the mean of the yield distribution, or (iii) both. We discuss mechanisms by which suppliers can be induced to adopt higher quality standards.</br>
