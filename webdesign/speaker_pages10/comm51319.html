Lee</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Faced with a new technology introduced in a market, a firm considers uncertainties regarding the future of this technology, network effects of adoption, and diseconomies of scales in costs while making the adoption decision. Recently, adoption of RFID technology is lower than expected due to this individual perspective of each firm. We study this low adoption problem and analyze the impact of methods to foster adoption such as quantity discounts, external funds, priority schemes, and mandates.</br>
