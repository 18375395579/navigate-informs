<br>Title: Effect of Upstream Competition in Spot Market on Short Life Product Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Oleksii Nikulkov, PhD Student, Stanford Graduate School of Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, nikulkov@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hau L. Lee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We allow wholesale price in supply chain with competing suppliers to be determined based on spot market quantity competition. Such pricing mechanism has potential to align supply chain by internalizing externalities of retailer's order. We compare our results to the model with monopolistic supplier and find that strong competition in spot market always benefits the supply chain, but moderate competition in multi-period setting could degrade supply chain performance.</br>
