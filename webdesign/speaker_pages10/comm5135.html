<br>Title: Buyback versus Revenue Sharing Contracts: Influence of Loss Aversion</br><br>Author: Yinghao Zhang, University of Minnesota, Suite 3-150, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN, 55108, United States of America, zhang786@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karen Donohue, Tony Cui</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate how suppliers set contract terms for buyback and revenue sharing contracts, and how their decisions influence profit. Using a combination of theory and lab experiments, we find that in low critical ratio, the results are similar to the channel coordination case while in high critical ratio, both contracts yield a lower profit with revenue sharing slightly better than buyback. These results are consistent with loss aversion and a desire to minimize ex post inventory error.</br>
