<br>Title: Complexity Analysis of Assembly Supply Chain Configurations</br><br>Author: Hui Wang, Graduate Student Research Assistant, University of Michigan, 1932 White Oak Ln, Ypsilanti, MI, 48198, United States, johnwang@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jack Hu, Goker Aydin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a metric for the complexity of an assembly chain. This metric takes into account the supply chain configuration, product variety offered by the supply chain, and the demand split among the products. We investigate how this complexity metric relates to the cost of the supply chain and show that complexity and cost are equivalent under certain conditions. We illustrate how this complexity measure can be used as a proxy for cost in decision making.</br>
