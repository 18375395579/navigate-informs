<br>Title: Inventory Management During Product Upgrade in Closed Loop Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Asima Mishra, Doctoral Student, Purdue University, 1310 Krannert Building, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, asima@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Iyer, Vinayak Deshpande</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider management of spare parts during product upgrade in a closed loop supply chain when both ‘old?and ‘new?version parts co-exist in the system. The objective is to find a policy to allocate the ‘new?and ‘old?version parts to products when products fail, that maximizes the product uptime. We develop a periodic review inventory system in which the number of parts that fail in a period depends on the number of products in operation. It is shown that a threshold type of policy is optimal for certain class of demand distributions.</br>
