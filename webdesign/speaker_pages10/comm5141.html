<br>Title: Benefits of Decentralized Decision Making</br><br>Author: Elena Belavina, Assistant Professor, University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60611, United States of America, Elena.Belavina@chicagobooth.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karan Girotra</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The inefficiency of decentralized decision-making is one of the most influential findings of the supply chain coordination literature. This paper shows that with the possibility of continuing trade, decentralization can be beneficial in improving supply chain performance. In a supply chain with decentralized decision-making and continuing trade, it is easier to incentivize players to coordinate on efficient actions.</br>
