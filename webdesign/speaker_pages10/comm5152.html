<br>Title: Should Buyers use Procurement Service Providers if Suppliers have Private Information on Disruptions</br><br>Author: Zhibin (Ben) Yang, Assistant Professor, University of oregon, United States of America, zyang@uoregon.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Volodymyr Babich</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: It is a common practice to hire a PSP, because its knowledge of the supply base improves supplier selection and management. However, economic wisdom is that the buyer is always better off contracting with the suppliers directly, if the PSP’s knowledge concerns supply costs.  In a model with asymmetric information regarding supply risks, we identify, quantify, and explain all of the benefits and the costs to a buyer of using a PSP, and describe conditions for the benefits to exceed the costs.</br>
