<br>Title: Joint Dynamic Pricing of Multiple Perishable Products under Consumer Choice</br><br>Author: Yalcin Akcay, Turkey, yakcay@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Susan Xu, Harihara Prasad Natarajan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a dynamic pricing problem facing a firm that sells given initial inventories of multiple substitutable products over a finite horizon. Product demands are linked through consumer choice processes, depending on the nature of product differentiation. We formulate this joint dynamic pricing problem as a stochastic dynamic program and characterize the optimal prices.</br>
