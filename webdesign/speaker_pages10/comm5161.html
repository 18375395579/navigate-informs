<br>Title: MTS-MTO Production Systems in Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Phil Kaminsky, Associate Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, kaminsky@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Onur Kaya</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a two facility supply chain featuring a manufacturer served by a single supplier, both of which need to decide which items to produce to order, and which items to produce to stock.  MTS Inventory levels must be set, MTO due dates must be quoted, and sequencing decisions must be made. We design algorithms for various versions of these models, and use these algorithms  to assess the value of joint MTS-MTO systems, and the value of centralized control.</br>
