<br>Title: Competitive Pricing and Location with Differentiated Products</br><br>Author: Binbin Liu, PhD Candidate, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, binbin.liu02@rotman.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dmitry Krass, Oded Berman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the duopoly's simultaneous pricing and location game with differentiated products. Customers' valuation of a product increases in quality, and decreases in price and distance. We derive Nash Equilibrium pricing, location and product differentiation strategies. Different kinds of equilibriums results are shown, with insights from these Equilibrium results discussed.</br>
