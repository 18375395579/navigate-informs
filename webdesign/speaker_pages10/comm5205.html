<br>Title: Optimal Design of a Pharmaceutical Price-Volume Agreement</br><br>Author: Hui Zhang, Lakehead University, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON, P7B 5E1, Canada, hzhang2@lakeheadu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Greg Zaric</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Price-volume agreements are commonly negotiated between drug manufacturers and third-party payers for drugs.  In one form of price-volume agreement a drug manufacturer pays a rebate to the payer on a portion of sales in excess of a specified sales threshold.  We examine the optimal design of such an agreement under two different assumptions about pricing, each under complete and asymmetric information about the mean demand.</br>
