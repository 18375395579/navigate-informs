<br>Title: Supply Chain Contracting in the Presence of Store Brands</br><br>Author: Arcan Nalca, Queen's School of Business, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, arcan.nalca@business.queensu.ca</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain with a retailer and a national brand manufacturer. The retailer sells its store brand in addition to the national brand in an environment where the demand is stochastic and sensitive to the prices of the two products. We investigate the impact of a buy-back and a revenue-sharing contract offered by the manufacturer. Moreover, we identify the profit and assortment implications of these contracts on the manufacturer and the retailer.</br>
