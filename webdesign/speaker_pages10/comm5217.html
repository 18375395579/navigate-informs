<br>Title: Purchasing, Pricing, and Quick Response in the Presence of Strategic Consumers</br><br>Author: Robert Swinney, Doctoral Student, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut St. Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, rswinney@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gerard Cachon</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We address the issue of a retailer selling a short life cycle product to a strategic consumer population.  The retailer sets the inventory level and the markdown price of a product, and consumers anticipate future markdowns when choosing whether to purchase an item at the full price or wait for a sale.  We consider how quick response inventory practices-the ability of a retailer to rapidly replenish inventory after learning about demand-are affected by strategic consumer purchasing behavior.</br>
