<br>Title: Marketing Green Products Subject to Scarce Resources</br><br>Author: Jiong Sun, Assistant Professor of Management, Illinois Institute of Technology, 565 W Adams St., Chicago, IL, 60661, United States of America, jsun22@iit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo, Sunder Kekre</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This research is motivated by a mass manufacturer introducing “green?vehicles that run on bio-fuel, a fuel with limited supply, along with “brown?vehicles that run on fossil fuel. The scarcity of the complementary product causes the consumers utility to be endogenously determined by the consumers' own vehicle choice. We study the impact of the externalities on the manufacturer’s product and pricing strategies, as well as the impact of the green segment size and fluctuating fossil fuel price.</br>
