<br>Title: Impact of Operational Flexibility on Aircraft Conversion at the US Coast Guard</br><br>Author: Vinayak Deshpande, Associate Professor, Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, vinayak@mgmt.purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Asima Mishra, Ananth Iyer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents the impact of operational flexibility on aircraft conversion from an older to a newer version at the US Coast Guard (USCG). We consider three levels of flexibility: full flexibility, partial flexibility and no flexibility. Both optimization models and Markov Chain based models have been developed to compare aircraft performance under the above three levels of flexibility.</br>
