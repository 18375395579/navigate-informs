<br>Title: Inventory Management of a Fast-Fashion Retail Network</br><br>Author: Jeremie Gallien, Associate Professor, Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, E53-389, 30 Wadsworth Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States, jgallien@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Felipe Caro</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Fast-fashion retailers like Zara have met some success responding to volatile demand trends through frequent introductions of new garments produced in small series. An important associated operational problem is the allocation over time of a limited amount of inventory across all stores in their network. We present stochastic and deterministic models developed in collaboration with a large fast-fashion retailer to address this challenge, then discuss the implementation and impact of this work.</br>
