<br>Title: Supply Chain Coordination with Financial Constraints and Bankruptcy Costs</br><br>Author: Wenhui Zhao, Associate Professor, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Room 103, Building 4, 535 Fahuazhen Road, Shanghai, 200052, China, zhaownh108@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a supply chain with a retailer having a single opportunity to order from a supplier to satisfy uncertain demand. Both parties may be capital constrained and incur bankruptcy risks if borrow short-term loans. We show that a revenue sharing contract with slight modification may still coordinate the chain, a buyback contract is equivalent to a revenue sharing contract for small bankruptcy costs but less efficient for high costs, and an all-unit quantity discount contract cannot coordinate.</br>
