<br>Title: Responding to Excess Demand in a Two Stage Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Zhixin Liu, Ohio State University, Department of Management Sciences, 2100 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States, liu.573@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas G. Hall</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Consider a multiple product supply chain with one manufacturer and several distributors, where capacity constraints prevent the manufacturer from meeting all its orders. We model the manufacturer’s problem as a combined scheduling and negotiation problem. We model the distributors?problem as a cooperative game, where the distributors make revised decisions about order quantities. We discuss the value of information sharing and cooperation in the supply chain, and provide managerial insights.</br>
