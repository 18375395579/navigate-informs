<br>Title: Liking and Following and the Newsvendor: Operations and Marketing Policies under Social Influence</br><br>Author: Jiahua Wu, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E4, Canada, Jiahua.Wu09@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ming Hu, Joseph Milner</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a monopolistic firm selling two substitutable products to a stream of sequential arrivals whose purchase decisions can be influenced by earlier purchases. Ex ante demand, the firm faces a newsvendor problem for the two products with economies of scale in production for each. Social influence among customers has mainly negative effect on the newsvendor. We propose two solutions for the firm to better cope with social influence: firm-recruited influencers and production postponement.</br>
