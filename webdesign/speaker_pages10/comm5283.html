<br>Title: Collaborative Forecast between Retailers under Endogenous Wholesale Price</br><br>Author: Hyo duk Shin, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, hyoduk-shin@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Noam Shamir</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the incentives of newsvendor retailers to share demand information when the wholesale price is set endogenously. We show how the timing of the manufacturer’s pricing decision affects the motivation of the retailers to share information, and that the manufacturer can be worse-off or better-off when information is shared.</br>
