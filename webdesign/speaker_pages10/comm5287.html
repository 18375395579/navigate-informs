<br>Title: Product Design and Demand Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Qin Geng, Assistant Professor, Robert Morris University, School of Business, 6001 University Boul, Moon Township, PA 15108, United States, qingeng@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Petruzzi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Price-setting newsvendor model provides framework for understanding how demand uncertainty affects optimal pricing. The model assumes that the product specifications are designed regardless of whether or not the seller of the product is facing uncertainty in demand. But what if the product design question is given explicit consideration? We investigate how uncertainty affects the product design decision and how this question affects our understanding of how demand uncertainty affects pricing.</br>
