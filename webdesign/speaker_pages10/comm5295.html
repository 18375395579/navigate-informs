<br>Title: Efficiency of Supply Chains Under Imperfect Competition and Nonlinear Demand</br><br>Author: Georgia Perakis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 100 Main Street, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, georgiap@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Sun</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a two-tier supply chain where a supplier offers price-only contracts to asymmetric retailers facing nonlinear demand. We quantify the decentralized supply chain performance in terms of channel profit, market penetration, social welfare and rent extraction. We show that retailer asymmetry deteriorates performance while competition improves efficiency but the inefficiency is smaller when demand is concave rather than convex.</br>
