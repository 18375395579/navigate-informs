<br>Title: Material Flow Variability in Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Wei Luo, IESE Business School, Avenida Pearson, 21, Barcelona, Spain, wluo@iese.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Li Chen, Kevin Shang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the variability of shipment and sales in a multi-echelon supply chain. We show the conditions under which this variability will amplify or dampen along the supply chain. Our study bridges the gap between the theoretical and empirical research on the bullwhip effect.</br>
