<br>Title: Multi-retailer Supply Chains with Nonlinear Production Costs: Centralized and Decentralized</br><br>Author: Yigal Gerchak, Professor, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv 69978, Israel, yigal@post.tau.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gilad Schwartz</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Several industries, such as the gasoline and apparel industries, that face nonlinear production costs in the short term, are undergoing spin-offs of retail operations.  We study centralized and decentralized supply chains with multiple retailers and one manufacturer under uncertain demand, with both exogenous and endogenous prices.  Our goal is to shed light on how nonlinear production costs combined with decentralization affect production quantities, prices and profits.</br>
