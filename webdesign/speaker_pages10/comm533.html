<br>Title: A Break-even Analysis for RFID Technology for Inventory Sensitive to Shrinkage</br><br>Author: Karel van Donselaar, Eindhoven University of Technology, PO BOX 513, Eindhoven, NB, 5611 PT, Netherlands, K.H.v.Donselaar@tm.tue.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ton de Kok, Tom van Woensel</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: With RFID tags retailers try to control for shrinkage. Current inventory control systems do not take into account the inventory data inaccuracy resulting from shrinkage. Therefore costly audits are performed in which actual inventory is counted. The research in this paper adapts the inventory policy by including the impact of both shrinkage and RFID technology. An exact analytical expression as well as a simple rough-cut approximation is derived for the break-even prices of an RFID tag.</br>
