<br>Title: The Impact of Pricing and Buy-Back Menus on Supply Chain Performance</br><br>Author: Pranava Goundan, Doctoral Candidate, Operations Research Center, MIT, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Building E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, pranava@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ann Chan, David Simchi-Levi</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the impact of a Buy-back Menu contract in a single-supplier, multi-retailer supply chain facing linear additive demand, that makes both pricing and inventory decisions. We compare two systems: competing and coordinating retailers, and show that using the proposed contract in both systems, the supplier may improve the performance of the supply chain to at least 75%, while still being guaranteed at least 50% of the optimal global supply chain profit.</br>
