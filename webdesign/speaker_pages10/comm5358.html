<br>Title: Supply Chain Contract Design: Impact of  Bounded Rationality and Individual Heterogeneity</br><br>Author: Diana Wu, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States of America, dianawu@ku.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kay-Yut Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We model two forms of bounded rationality in a newsvendor setting: the tendency to err and the tendency to anchor. The model is motivated by observations under several types of supply chain contracts in the laboratory. Our experiments show that the behavior of newsvendors follows some multi-modal distribution that responds to contract settings. Moreover, we discover heterogeneity in decision makers?tendencies. New insights on contract design are obtained by applying this behavioral model.</br>
