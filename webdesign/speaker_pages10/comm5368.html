<br>Title: Revenue Sharing in Airline Alliances</br><br>Author: Xing Hu, Assistant Professor, University of Oregon, 484 Lillis Hall,, 1208 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, 97401, United States of America, xingh@uoregon.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rene Caldentey, Gustavo Vulcano</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study codeshare, the practice of independent airlines collaboratively marketing and operating fights. We propose a two-stage hierarchical approach to study the revenue sharing rules and decentralized inventory controls from both cooperative and non-cooperative game approach. Through both analytical and numerical studies, we find that revenue sharing rule affects the system significantly. We identify the existence and uniqueness of an admissible and efficient revenue sharing.</br>
