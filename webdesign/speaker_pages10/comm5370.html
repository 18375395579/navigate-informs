<br>Title: Micro-competition Analysis on Retail Small Stores</br><br>Author: Xinxin Bai, IBM China Research Lab, Zuanshi Build, Zhongguancun Software, Beijing, 100193, China, baixx@cn.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hairong Lv, Wenjun Yin, Jin Dong</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Many retail small store chain operators are eager to know how to quantitatively evaluate new store locations. In this paper, we propose a novel method which can predict the competitions among new/competing stores. We develop a model to estimate different customers' demand and the relationship between customers and multiple stores. A real case on the micro-competition analysis in a China city for one leading retail small store operators shows that our method is more practical and accurate.</br>
