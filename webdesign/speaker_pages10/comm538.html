<br>Title: Inventory Service Level Agreements as Coordination Mechanisms</br><br>Author: Doug Thomas, Penn State University, 463 Business Building, University Park, PA, United States, dthomas@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Davis, Elena Katok</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A supplier balancing inventory cost and profit margin may choose a stock level that maximizes her profitability but is sub-optimal from the view of the retailer and the overall supply chain.  To address this double marginalization problem, a retailer may introduce a service level agreement, offering a bonus for meeting a predetermined fill rate over a specified (finite) horizon.  We experimentally investigate how such service level agreements affect supplier stocking decisions.</br>
