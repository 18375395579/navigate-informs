<br>Title: Closed-loop Supply Chain Models in Manufacturing-Remanufacturing Operations</br><br>Author: Tianqin Shi, University of Illnois at Urbana Champaign, 1206 S. Sixth St., 350 Wohlers Hall, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, tshi3@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dilip Chhajed, Zhixi Wan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: While a centralized firm is more willing to design a product for re-manufacturability, in a firm where different divisions do the remanufacturing and manufacturing, the manufacturing division may need incentive to do so. Using a stylized model we analyze this problem and propose incentive systems to encourage the manufacturer to design the product that can be re-manufactured.</br>
