<br>Title: Pricing and Rationing When Selling to Snobbish Consumers</br><br>Author: Kenan Arifoglu, Assistant Professor, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, k-arifoglu@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Seyed Iravani, Sarang Deo</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the pricing policy and capacity decision of a firm selling snob-appeal products such as high-fashion luxury goods to forward-looking, exclusivity-seeking (snobbish) consumers. We use our model to explain the heterogeneity in pricing of snob-appeal products; some firms adopt uniform pricing while others mark down. We also find cases, where firms create scarcity and mark the price down simultaneously during the selling season.</br>
