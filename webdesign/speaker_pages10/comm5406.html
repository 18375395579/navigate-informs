<br>Title: Iterated Beam Search Solution for the Combined Level Scheduling and Car Sequencing Problem</br><br>Author: Mesut Yavuz, Associate Professor, Shenandoah University, Byrd School of Business, 1460 University Drive, Winchester, VA, 22601, United States of America, myavuz@su.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Level scheduling is an important problem in just-in-time manufacturing, aiming to fairly allocate time on a shared production line to competing product variants. In automotive assembly, scheduling product variants is subject to additional option constraints. In this talk we present a novel Iterated Beam Search algorithm to solve the Combined Level Scheduling and Car Sequencing Problem. We also discuss the method’s application to the Car Sequencing Problem alone.</br>
