<br>Title: Inventory Models with Ordering Time Constraints Due to Limited Supplier/Transportation Capacity</br><br>Author: Metin Cakanyildirim, School of Management, The University of Texas at Dallas, 2200 N Floyd Rd, Richardson, TX, United States of America, metin@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lama Moussawi, Alain Bensoussan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: An ordering time constraint is considered, which allows a retailer to order only when there is no outstanding order.  This can be caused by the limited supplier capacity, or limited transportation capacity between the supplier and the retailer.  In the former case, the supplier can process only one order at a time and does not start to process the next order before finishing the outstanding order.  We establish the optimality of (s,S) policies and show the uniqueness of some policy parameters.</br>
