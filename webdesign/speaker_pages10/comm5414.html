<br>Title: Adjusting Remanufacturing Capacity Using Sales and Return Information</br><br>Author: Suphalat Chittamvanich, Iowa State University, 2019 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011-2164, United States, suphalat@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sarah Ryan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Remanufacturing capacity may be adjusted as sales and returns vary over time. Using properties of K-concave functions,we prove the optimality of a simple expansion and contraction policy,where the threshold values and target levels depend on the number of items sold but not yet returned. The effects on the capacity policy of different patterns of product sales, non-stationary revenue from processing the returns and levels of variability in the return distribution are found in numerical studies.</br>
