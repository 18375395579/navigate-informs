<br>Title: Integrated Scenario Design and Inventory Control</br><br>Author: Aurelie Thiele, P.C. Rossin Asst Professor, Lehigh University, 200 W Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States of America, aurelie.thiele@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gokhan Metan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We integrate scenario design and inventory control in a robust framework for a new product; the demand distribution is not available, but the manager receives advance information on the success (high, low or moderate) of the product and knows range forecasts in each scenario. We derive the optimal order in closed form and provide insights into the impact of the cost parameters. We also compute the critical probability of the baseline scenario for which the manager switches between strategies.</br>
