<br>Title: Spot Trading vs. Hedging: Risk Management in Spot Market</br><br>Author: Xuan Zhao, Associate Professor, Wilfrid Laurier University, 75 University Ave. W., Waterloo, On, N2J 3C5, Canada, xzhao@wlu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Xing</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The spot market can effectively help firms to manage demand uncertainty by providing a continuous available trading platform. The spot price can also be viewed as a commonly observable underlying variable correlated with the demand uncertainty, thus firms can also enter into a forward contract to buy a certain units of a hedging asset at the spot price. We consider a two-echelon supply chain and explore the equilibrium risk hedging strategies.</br>
