<br>Title: Does Inventory Productivity Predict Future Stock Returns? A Retailing Industry Perspective</br><br>Author: Yasin Alan, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, Vanderbilt University, Owen School, 401 21st Ave. S., Nashville, TN, 37203, United States of America, Yasin.Alan@owen.vanderbilt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vishal Gaur, George Gao</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We find that inventory productivity strongly predicts future stock returns among a sample of U.S. retailers between 1985 to 2010. A zero-cost long-short portfolio investment strategy, which consists of buying from the two highest and selling from the two lowest quintiles formed on inventory turnover, earns more than 1% abnormal return per month on average.  Our findings suggest that the stock market rewards retailers with high inventory productivity.</br>
