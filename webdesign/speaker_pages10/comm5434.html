<br>Title: Impact of Replenishment Policies on the Value of Demand Information in a Serial Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Kevin Shang, Fuqua School of Busines, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States, khshang@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sean Zhou</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A supply chain includes material and information flows.
