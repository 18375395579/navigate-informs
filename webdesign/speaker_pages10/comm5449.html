<br>Title: Robust Optimization for Fuel Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Anna Danandeh, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, annadanandeh@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Zeng, Brent Caldwell</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a multi-period supply chain model which includes quality, heterogeneous unit specifications, environmental requirements and transportation issues. In order to capture uncertainties in those components, a robust formulation is proposed and some numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of this model.</br>
