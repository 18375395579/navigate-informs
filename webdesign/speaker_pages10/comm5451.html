<br>Title: Inventory Sharing and Preventive Transshipments with Local Decision Making</br><br>Author: Ying Rong, Ph.D Student, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Lehigh University, 200 West Packer Avenue, Mohler Lab, Room 371, Bethlehem, PA, 18015, United States, ying.rong@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yang Sun, Lawrence Snyder</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In order to cope with demand uncertainty in the supply chain via the risk-pooling effect, retailers can share their inventory between replenishments from their suppliers. In this study, we analyze the optimal behavior of two decentralized retailers in a two-period setting with preventive transshipments allowed at the beginning of the second period. We discuss the impact of the transshipment price and compare the systems with and without transshipments.</br>
