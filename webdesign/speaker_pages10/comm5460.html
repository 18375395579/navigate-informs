<br>Title: The Value of Postponement: Market Drivers and Input Commonality</br><br>Author: Nils Rudi, Associate Professor, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, nils.rudi@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Pyke, Jiri Chod</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We examine a make-to-order production system assuming an arbitrary bill of material (BOM), price-sensitive demands and secondary market for components. We challenge the commonly accepted insight that the value of postponement increases in demand variability and decreases in demand correlation, showing how these effects depend on commonalities in the BOM.</br>
