<br>Title: Process-based Contractual Mechanisms for Collaborative Development Initiatives</br><br>Author: Nektarios Oraiopoulos, University Lecturer in Operations Management, Judge Business School, Cambridge University, Trumptington St., Cambridge, United Kingdom, n.oraiopoulos@jbs.cam.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vishal Agrawal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we study initiatives for co-development of new products and technologies. In such settings, it may be difficult a priori to specify contracts contingent on the outcome. Therefore, we investigate the efficacy of different process-based contracts, which instead specify the decision-making process.</br>
