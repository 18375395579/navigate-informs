<br>Title: Disruption-Management Strategies for Short Life-Cycle Products</br><br>Author: Brian Tomlin, Assistant Professor, University of North Carolina, McColl Building, CB3490, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States, brian_tomlin@unc.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Diversification, contingent sourcing, and demand management are key building blocks of a disruption-management strategy. In this paper, we investigate the influence of key attributes of the firm, its supplier(s), and its products on the firm’s preference for various strategies. These attributes include supplier reliability, supplier failure correlation, payment responsibility, product contribution margin, product substitutability, demand uncertainties and correlation, and loss aversion.</br>
