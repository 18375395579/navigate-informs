<br>Title: A Dynamic Pricing Model for Hybrid Manufacturing</br><br>Author: Baris Ata, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, b-ata@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Canan Savaskan, Mustafa Akan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider a product over its life cycle and advance a dynamic pricing model to best synchronize used-product returns with demand so as to improve the profits. We characterize the optimal prices and compare it to pricing under pure manufacturing. We show that in some cases, it is optimal to have returns exceed demand. Otherwise, it uses a dual manufacturing mode throughout the product's life cycle. Finally, contrary to the conventional thinking that remanufacturing and product recovery are end of product life activities, we show that it is never optimal to delay investing in product remanufacturing capabilities.</br>
