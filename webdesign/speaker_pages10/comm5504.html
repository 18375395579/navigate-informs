<br>Title: Product Line Design Optimization for Heterogeneous Markets: A Decomposition-based Approach</br><br>Author: Jeremy Michalek, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Scaife Hall 323, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, jmichalek@cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Optimization of product attribute levels using conjoint data is common; however, products with engineering content involve critical tradeoffs in the ability to actually achieve desired levels. We present a method for product line optimization that incorporates consumer heterogeneity and efficiently coordinates positioning and design models to achieve realizable firm-level optima, and we examine the tradeoff between part commonality and product differentiation.</br>
