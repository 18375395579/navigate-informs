<br>Title: Optimal Buying and Selling Strategies for a Power Retailer</br><br>Author: Miguel Carrion, Univ. Castilla - La Mancha, Campus Universitario s/n, Ciudad Real, Spain, Miguel.Carrion@uclm.es</br><br>Coauthor(s): Antonio J. Conejo, Jose M. Arroyo</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: An electricity retailer faces two sources of uncertainty. While buying electricity, it must cope with uncertain pool prices or sign forward contracts. While selling electricity, it should handle the fact that customers might choose a different retailer if the selling price is not competitive. We propose a risk-constrained stochastic programming framework to decide which forward contract the retailer should sign and at which price it must sell electricity so that its expected profit is maximized.</br>
