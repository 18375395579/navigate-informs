<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Control of Substitutable Products</br><br>Author: Zhongjun Tian, Olin School of Business, Washington University in St. Louis, Campus Box 1133, St. Louis, MO, 63130, United States, tian@wustl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lingxiu Dong, Panos Kouvelis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the joint dynamic pricing and inventory control of multiple substitutable and perishable products for a retailer. The multinomial logit (MNL) model is adopted to capture consumer choice preferences. We derive the optimal dynamic pricing policy for the entire selling season, and identify key factors that affect the pricing guidelines. We study the effect of various pricing schemes on the initial inventory/assortment decisions and the interaction between the pricing and initial decisions.</br>
