<br>Title: Pricing and Production Planning Under Supply Uncertainty with Multiple Customer Segments</br><br>Author: Burak Kazaz, Associate Professor, Syracuse University, Whitman School of Management, Syracuse, NY, 13244, United States, bkazaz@syr.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brian Tomlin, Nenad Jukic</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a firm that determines the production quantity, but obtains only a fraction due to supply uncertainty. The realized amount is allocated to two customer segments (high and low-level). The price for high-level customers is set before production occurs, and the price for low-level customers is determined after observing the supply. Using a poly-instantiated database, high-level customers have access to both prices, however, low-level customers can access the price only at their level.</br>
