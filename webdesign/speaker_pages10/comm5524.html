<br>Title: Remanufacturing in Decentralized Supply Chains with Uncertain</br><br>Author: Huafan Ma, UW-Milwaukee, 1315 N Cass St. APT305, Milwaukee, WI, 53202, United States of America, mahuafan@uwm.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Samar Mukhopadhyay</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a decentralized supply chain with one OEM and one  retailer that trade with either a push or pull contract. The OEM can process both used and new parts for the production of new products while the yield of the used parts is random. The OEM makes procurement and production decisions and the retailer makes ordering decisions based on their own cost/incentive structures. We develop different models to determine their optimal policies.</br>
