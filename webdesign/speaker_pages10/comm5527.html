<br>Title: The Role of Leadership in Encouraging Sustainability in Agro-Based Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Pranab Majumder, Assistant Professor of Operations, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, majumder@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ashok Srinivasan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We examine the issue of promoting sustainability in long supply chains with agricultural inputs, which has a high impact on the environment. Sustainability in also includes reliability of supply from marginal farmers. We use a model where the leader has the ability to offer contracts to any other member of the chain. Our model shows that by directly offering contracts to the input producer, the supply chain leader can promote sustainability; in many cases the chain efficiency also increases.</br>
