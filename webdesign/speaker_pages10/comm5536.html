<br>Title: Optimal Order Policy for a Remanufacturer with Different Acquisition Costs</br><br>Author: Aejaz Khan, amkhan4@mail.uh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Guide</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the optimal product acquisition decision for a remanufacturer that must acquire the right quality and quantity of used products to maximize profits.  We determine the optimal order quantity for the case when used products must be graded into different quality levels before remanufacturing. Next, we determine the optimal order quantity for the case when used product is already graded into nominal quality levels.</br>
