<br>Title: A Dynamic Mechanism for Achieving Sustainable Quality Supply</br><br>Author: Fang Liu, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, 639798, Singapore, liu_fang@ntu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jing-Sheng Song, Tracy Lewis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Various companies have realized the importance of sustainable quality supply and initiated sustainability guidelines. However, are these guidelines sufficient to ensure sustainable quality supply? We design a dynamic mechanism that implements sustainable quality supply. Part of our mechanism suggests a two-part nonlinear tariff payment which is consistent with the existing industry guidelines; whereas the other part suggests new elements such as the probabilistic decision rights.</br>
