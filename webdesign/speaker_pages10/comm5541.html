<br>Title: Bullwhip and Reverse Bullwhip Effects under the Rationing Game</br><br>Author: Ying Rong, Assistant Professor, Antai College of Economics & Management,Shanghai  Jiao Tong University, 535 Fahuazhen Road, Shanghai, 200052, China, yrong@sjtu.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Larry Snyder, Z. Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Under the risk of scarce supply, retailers may compete  with each other by increasing their order sizes in the hope of  getting a larger portion of the available inventory. We show that the reverse bullwhip effect, in which the retailers' order variance is higher than the capacity variance, occurs between the supplier and the retailers. This result indicates that demand uncertainty can be amplified upstream, while supply uncertainty can propagate downstream.</br>
