<br>Title: Risk Averse Selective Newsvendor with All-or-nothing Orders</br><br>Author: Kiran Chahar, Ph.D Candidate, Clemson University, 110 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States, kchahar@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Taaffe</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consider a firm offering its product for a single selling season to various unconfirmed demand sources each with unique forecasted demand and revenue. The order may either come in at a predefined level or not come in at all (all-or-nothing), and the firm can choose to pursue the order or not. We propose an order selection approach minimizing the risk of incurring losses below some threshold value. We employ multiple optimization models, including a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach.</br>
