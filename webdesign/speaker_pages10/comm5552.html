<br>Title: Using Quantity Discounts to Improve Coordination in a Two-Level Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Jing Ma, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, majing@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Geunes, Yongpei Guan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a two-level decentralized supply chain where a supplier serves a retailer facing dynamic demands over a finite horizon. We model the problem as a Stackelberg game in which the supplier offers a quantity discount scheme to the retailer, who then orders from the supplier in order to meet fixed demands. The supplier thus determines quantity discount parameters that maximize its profit. We propose algorithms for setting these discount parameters and analyze their impacts on both players.</br>
