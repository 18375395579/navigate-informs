Carey School of Business, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, Rui.Yin@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hongmin Li, Christopher Tang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a firm who sells two successive generations of a product to forward-looking customers. A trade-in program is offered which allows customers to trade-in the old product and buy the new product at a discounted price. We determine the optimal prices of the two products and examine the effectiveness of the trade-in program.</br>
