<br>Title: A Transaction Cost Economics Model of Vertical Integration Drivers for Remanufacturing Operations</br><br>Author: Pinar Martin, Bocconi University, Milan, Italy, pinarmartin@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Guide</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Despite recent attention to closed-loop supply chains, there is scant information about organizational design for OEMs engaging in remanufacturing.

We also find that forward outsourcing activities can have a profound impact on the profitability of OEMs.</br>
