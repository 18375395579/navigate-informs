<br>Title: Organic Production Systems:  An Emerging Operations Strategy?</br><br>Author: Lieven Demeester, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Avenue, 138676, Singapore, lieven.demeester@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mei Qi, Luk Van Wassenhove</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We use a modified optimal market area model to show how supply chains are shaped by complementarities between material recycling, low-cost flexible process technologies, and plants taking advantage of local adaptation and customer proximity.  We examine these complementarities in propositions and demonstrate that, in a realistic example for an engineering plastic in Western Europe, an understanding of these complementarities can make the difference between the continuation of a supply chain without recycling and the emergence of a closed-loop supply chain with recycling, localization, and market areas less than one third their original sizes.  Our analysis shows that this combination of features, labeled “organic production? qualifies as a supply-chain-level operations strategy, forms a model for emerging closed-loop supply chains, and, can have important implications for product, operations and supply chain strategies.</br>
