<br>Title: Mitigating Cost Shocks Through Supply Base Design</br><br>Author: Zhixi Wan, PhD candidate, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, wanzhixi@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Damian Beil</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A buyer must select a set of suppliers to maintain as a supply base. Contracts are auctioned periodically and the buyer seeks to minimize long-term expected costs.  Suppliers in the same region have correlated costs, and the buyer can mitigate the influence of correlated costs by choosing suppliers from different regions. We find that full diversification - choosing suppliers from as many different regions as possible - is not always optimal, as similar costs can enhance auction competition.</br>
