<br>Title: Understanding the Performance of the Long Chain and Sparse Designs in Process Flexibility</br><br>Author: Yehua Wei, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 60 Wadsworth,10B, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, y4wei@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This presentation develops theories to explain the effectiveness of the long chain and other sparse process flexibility designs in manufacturing systems. In the presentation, we first uncover a supermodular property for the long chain, and proceed to prove several theorems. Our results verify the effectiveness of the long chain, which has been observed empirically in both academia and industry. Moreover, the results provide new insights to how to create sparse designs.</br>
