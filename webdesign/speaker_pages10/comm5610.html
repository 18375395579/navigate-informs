<br>Title: A Two-period Newsvendor Problem with Production Cost Learning</br><br>Author: He Xiuli, Visiting Assistant Professor, School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, 75083, United States of America, xiulihe@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Suresh Sethi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer who faces demand uncertainty. We adopt a price-dependent newsvendor model which takes the multiplicative form. We assume that the manufacturer can reduce the per unit product cost in the second period as a result of accumulated production experience in economy of scale. The retailer decides a retail price and an order quantity prior to facing random demand in each period. We consider two cases: a myopic and a far-sighted retailer.</br>
