<br>Title: A Real Options-based Analysis for Quality Control</br><br>Author: Wahab Ismail, Assistant Professor, Ryerson University, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Toronto, ON, M5B 2K3, Canada, wahab@ryerson.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop an option valuation framework for a manufacturing process and study how quality control strategy could be implemented when there are uncertain demand, uncertain price, and a stochastic product life cycle for a product in the market. This study helps decision makers understand how the profitability associated with quality control strategy varies with given uncertainties.</br>
