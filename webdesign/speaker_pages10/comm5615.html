<br>Title: Supply Chain Disruption and Quality</br><br>Author: Susan A. Slotnick, Professor, Cleveland State University, BU 542, 2121 Euclid Avenue, Sandusky, OH, 44115, United States of America, s.slotnick@csuohio.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rebecca Clemons</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A manufacturer has two suppliers of a critical component. One supplier produces at an acceptable quality level but there is a random possibility of disruption. The second supplier delivers products of lower quality, but without disruption. The manufacturer incurs purchasing, holding and backorder costs,  and in each period decides how much to order from each supplier, and how much to spend to raise the quality of the new supplier.</br>
