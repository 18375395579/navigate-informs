<br>Title: Coordination of Operations and Finance in a Growing Firm</br><br>Author: Danko Turcic, WSOM, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, danko.turcic@case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Sobel</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We address the coordination of operations and finance in a growing firm by optimizing the expected present value of the time stream of dividends in a dynamic model in which demands comprise an ARMA process.  The recurring decisions are production quantity, dividends, and short-term borrowing. We study the asymptotic properties of the optimal base-stock level policy for production-inventory. This yields insights into optimal borrowing and production planning for growing firms.</br>
