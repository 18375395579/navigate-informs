<br>Title: Optimal Planning of a Reverse-Logistics Supply Chain for a Consumer Electronics Retailer</br><br>Author: Andre Calmon, Massachusetts Institue of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E62-364, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, acalmon@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stephen C. Graves</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We describe, model, and optimize the reverse logistics that support the warranty system used by a Fortune 100 company that sells consumer electronics. Since this company uses refurbished devices to satisfy warranty claims, their reverse logistics operation is also a closed-loop supply chain.  Within this setting, our main contributions are: (i) Policies for managing inventory of refurbished devices in this system;  (ii) An algorithm for assigning refurbished items in inventory to customers.</br>
