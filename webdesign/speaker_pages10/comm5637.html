<br>Title: When Should an Online Retailer Choose Drop-shipping?</br><br>Author: Dennis Yu, Associate Professor, Clarkson University, School of Business, Potsdam, NY, 13699, United States of America, dyu@clarkson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Taesu Cheong, Daewon Sun</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Conventional in-stock and drop-shipping policies are considered for an online retailer (etailer). By incorporating channel power structures and different decision sequences/variables of the two procurement policies, we study the etailer's optimal procurement policy and supply chain performance. We analyze and compare the two procurement models with respect to the etailer's decision on inventory strategies.</br>
