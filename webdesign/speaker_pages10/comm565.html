<br>Title: Commitment and Reason in Bargaining with Joint Production</br><br>Author: Gary Bolton, Schwartz Professor of Business Economics, Pennsylvania State University, 334 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, geb3@smeal.psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We conduct a bargaining experiment with joint production to investigate the relationship between hard leverage (the option to make binding commitments) and soft leverage (appeals to asymmetric focal points) in providing bargaining advantage. Our data is consistent with the hypothesis that reason in the form of focal points bounds the use of commitment.</br>
