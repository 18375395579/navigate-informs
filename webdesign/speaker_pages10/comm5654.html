<br>Title: Delegation, Commitment and Bargaining in a Three-tier Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Pengfei Guo, Assistant Professor, The Department of Logistics, Hong Kong Polytechnic Univeristy, Hung Hum, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, pengfei.guo@polyu.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeannette Song, Yulan Wang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a three-tier supply chain consisting of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), a contract manufacturer (CM) and a component supplier. We analyze and compare two outsourcing structures currently implemented by top-tier OEMs:  consignment and turnkey. We study the two-period bargaining games with one-sided information and one-sided offer among the three parties.  We show that the gain of turnkey depends on cost priors and parties' commitment power.</br>
