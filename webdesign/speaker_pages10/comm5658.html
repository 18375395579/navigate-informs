<br>Title: Incentives in Low-Demand Service Systems</br><br>Author: Sang-Hyun Kim, Doctoral Student, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut St. Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, shkim@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Morris Cohen, Serguei Netessine, Senthil Veeraraghavan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study contracting arrangements in a supply chain in which service delivery is outsourced and the demands for services arrive infrequently but have high impacts. Such cases arise often, for example, in after-sales services of expensive equipments. Low-demand environment presents unique challenges, in particular, an assessment of the contractor's performance. We identify inefficiencies and risks inherent in this setting and analyze the resulting incentive issues.</br>
