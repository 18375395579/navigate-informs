<br>Title: A Decentralized Distribution System with the Manufacturer’s Buyback and Resale</br><br>Author: Greys Sosic, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States, sosic@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ulas Ozen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a distribution system in which n retailers facing uncertain demand order inventory from a manufacturer.

We study the impact of this resale opportunity and compare our results with other cases (no resale of returned items, retailers redistributing inventory on their own).</br>
