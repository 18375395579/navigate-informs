<br>Title: Simulation Modeling of the Street-to-fleet Supply Chain for the Builder Community</br><br>Author: Mehdi Amini, Professor, University of Memphis, mamini@memphis.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mike Racer, David Cashbaugh, Tanja Blackstone</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Traditional supply chain analysis focuses on tangible products.

This supply chain is in charge of recruiting, training, and placement of sailors.</br>
