<br>Title: Dynamic Financial Hedging Strategies for a Storable  Commodity with Demand Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Zhan Pang, Lancaster University Management School, Department of Management Science, Lancaster, LA1 4YX, United Kingdom, z.pang@lancaster.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis, Qing Ding</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a firm that is managing a storable commodity in the presence of demand uncertainty, a volatile spot market and associated financial derivatives. The objective is to coordinate the replenishment and financial hedging decisions to maximize the mean-variance utility of the terminal wealth over a finite horizon. We  characterize the structure of optimal time-consistent policies. Our results shed new light into the interface between corporate risk management and operations management.</br>
