<br>Title: Dynamic Pricing and Leadtime Quotation in a Make-to-Order Queue</br><br>Author: Costis Maglaras, Associate Professor, Columbia University, Graduate School of Business, 409 Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, c.maglaras@gsb.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sabri Celik</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a profit maximizing make-to-order manufacturer that offers multiple products to a market of price and delay sensitive users. Our model captures three aspects of interest: 1) The joint use of dynamic pricing and leadtime quotation controls; 2) The ability to expedite orders at a cost; and 3) The interaction of the demand controls with sequencing and expediting decisions that the firm must employ to optimize profits and satisfy the quoted leadtimes.</br>
