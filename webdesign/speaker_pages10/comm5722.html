<br>Title: Supply Disruptions in a One-warehouse Multiple-retailer System</br><br>Author: Zumbul Bulut, zub205@lehigh.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence V. Snyder</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we examine the impact of supply disruptions on the OWMR systems. We analyze a locally controlled OWMR system with identical retailers each having deterministic demand. Assuming that supply disruptions happen only in the supply system of warehouse or retailers, we derive the expressions for the optimal base-stock levels. We propose a heuristic for approximating the base-stock levels when the disruptions happen in the supply systems of all locations.</br>
