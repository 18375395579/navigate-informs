<br>Title: Block T Discounts on the Internet</br><br>Author: John Wilson, Ivey School of Business, Univ. of Western Ontario, London, Canada, jwilson@ivey.uwo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jing Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Many of the new internet discount outlets have some form of a promotion involving T items offered at a discount price.

For a wide class of distributions, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a promotion to be optimal.</br>
