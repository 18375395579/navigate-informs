<br>Title: Competing for Shelf Space</br><br>Author: Victor Martinez de Albeniz, Assistant Professor, IESE Business School, Av. Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, valbeniz@iese.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guillaume Roels</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study competition for shelf space in a multi-supplier retail point. We consider a retailer that seeks to allocate its shelf space among different products to maximize its profit. To obtain larger shelf space allocations, product manufacturers can set lower wholesale prices, thereby increasing the retailer's profit margin on their products. We analyze the competitive dynamics arising from the scarcity of space.</br>
