<br>Title: Profit Smoothing and Product Pricing</br><br>Author: Mahesh Kumar, Assistant Professor, Rutgers Business School, 180 University Avenue, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States, mahesh@rbsmail.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Suresh Govindaraj</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new explanation for price discrimination in products and services that is based on the sellers?objective to smooth profits. We show that when sellers carry multiple products, the spread in buying and selling prices of any product depends on the profits and inventory positions of the other products. Consequently, sellers may price the same product differently depending on the range of products that they carry.</br>
