<br>Title: Cooperative Outsourcing Games with Significant Changeover Times</br><br>Author: Tolga Aydinliyim, Case Western Reserve University, Department of Operations, Cleveland, OH, 44106-7235, United States, txa50@case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Vairaktarakis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a cooperative outsourcing model where manufacturers outsource their operations to a single third-party with limited production capacity represented by manufacturing windows. After all manufacturers finish their bookings the third-party offers a new schedule which minimizes the total outsourcing costs of all manufacturers. Coordinated savings are allocated to manufacturers according to a fair allocation rule.</br>
