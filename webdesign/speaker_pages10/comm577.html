<br>Title: On the Choice of a Contract Under Bilateral Information Asymmetry</br><br>Author: Valery Pavlov, Ph.D Candidate, Supply Chain and Information Systems Department, PSU, 463A, Business Building, Smeal College of Business, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, vup112@psu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: As is commonly acknowledged, coordinating contracts are not nearly as widely used as the Pareto-inferior wholesale price contract.  We address this issue by (i) making the choice of a contract endogenous to the model and, (ii) by relaxing assumption of the perfect information. We find that under bilateral information asymmetry a wholesale price contract can be uniformly better for the supplier than a coordinating contract.</br>
