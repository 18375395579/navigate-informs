<br>Title: Selling to the Censored Newsvendor: Optimal Wholesale Price with Demand Learning</br><br>Author: Yunru Han, Columbia University, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, yhan14@gsb.columbia.edu.</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fangruo Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: One classic result concludes that the censored newsvendor sets a higher inventory level for demand learning instead of optimizing one-period profit. Yet if the supplier can change the wholesale price, she may either exploit or collaborate on the retailer’s learning policy, depending on the contracting and information sharing process. We study the supplier’s optimal wholesale price in various situations, and compare the profitability and efficiency of active learning and myopic policies under it.</br>
