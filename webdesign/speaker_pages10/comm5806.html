<br>Title: Estimating Supply Chain Integration with Demand Signal Processing</br><br>Author: Robert Bray, Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, IL, 60202, United States of America, robertlbray@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Haim Mendelson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study supply chain integration in the automotive industry, estimating how much auto manufacturers value stability in their suppliers' inventories. We find that: (i) the median auto manufacturer values stability in its suppliers' inventories 57% as much as stability in its own inventories, (ii) this integration reduces aggregate auto inventory variability by 44% the variability of demand, and (iii) the degree of integration increases significantly over the course of our sample.</br>
