<br>Title: Inventory Record Inaccuracy and RFID Adoption Incentives in a Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Seb Heese, Indiana University, 1309 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, hheese@indiana.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer, who suffers from inaccurate inventory records. We show that such inaccuracies exacerbate the inefficiencies resulting from double marginalization in the decentralized supply chain. Assuming that RFID technology eliminates the problem of inventory record inaccuracy, we determine the cost thresholds at which RFID adoption becomes profitable and show that RFID adoption improves supply chain coordination.</br>
