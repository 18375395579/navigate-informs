<br>Title: Flexible Backup Supply and The Management of Leadtime Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Jian Li, Northeastern Illinois University, 5500 N. St. Louis Ave, Chicago, IL, 60625, United States, jli@neiu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Facing leadtime uncertainty, the retailer conventionally places an order at a chosen time ahead to meet future demand.
