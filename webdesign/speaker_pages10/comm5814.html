Milton Stewart School of Systems and Industrial Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, aly@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc Goetschalckx</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-stage stochastic supply chain tactical planning model for multi-period, multi-commodity, and multi-echelon supply chains. The first stage decisions include supplier selection and supplier contract design.  The second stage decisions include inventory, backorder, transportation, product flow quantities and resource utilizations. The solution methodology and numerical results will be shared.</br>
