<br>Title: Flexible Backup Supply and The Management of Leadtime Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Jian Li, Assistant Professor, Department of Management and Marketing, Northeastern Illinois University, 5500 North St. Louis Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60625, United States, j-li3@neiu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Facing lead-time uncertainty, the retailer conventionally places an order at a chosen time ahead to meet future demand.  In this paper we study the potential use of a flexible backup supplier in a sole role, as an emergency resource in response to the lead-time information, or in a dual role, as a regular supplier that is assigned to meet part of the original demand interval and as an emergency response to lead-time information.</br>
