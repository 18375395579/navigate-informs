<br>Title: The Impact of New Product Introduction on Assembly Productivity in the N.A. Automotive Industry</br><br>Author: Manu Goyal, mgoyal@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Reindorp, Serguei Netessine</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Choosing the right manufacturing facility is a key element in the launch of a new or updated automotive product.  From a study of recent data on North American automobile production, we find that prior productivity is a significant predictor of productivity during launch and positively influences a plant's chances of being chosen as a launch site.  We also demonstrate that productivity during launch is improved when the launch is larger and/or flexible production methods are employed.</br>
