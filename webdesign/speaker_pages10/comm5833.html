<br>Title: Entry Deterrence Strategies Facing Capacitated Competition</br><br>Author: Huaqing Wang, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States of America, h.wang12@umiami.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Haresh Gurnani, Murat Erkoc</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a model in which a monopolistic incumbent faces entry of a capacitated entrant. As function of the entrant’s capacity, the incumbent can adopt different strategies to deter or accommodate the entrant. We show that when entry is inevitable, the capacitated entrant (incumbent) can get higher profit in Stackelberg competition as follower (leader) than in Nash Competition. We also consider a case in which the incumbent invests in changing consumers?product preference.</br>
