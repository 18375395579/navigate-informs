<br>Title: Process Innovation and Competition in an Industrial Symbiotic System</br><br>Author: Yunxia Zhu, University of Texas - Dallas, 800 West Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, yunxia.zhu@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Milind Dawande, Srinagesh Gavirneni, Vaidy Jayaraman</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Inspired by a real-world example of a paper-sugar symbiotic complex, we study the impact on a firm's operational decisions from implementing an industrial symbiotic system.

Our focus is on understanding the firm's “willingness?to implement the symbiotic system.</br>
