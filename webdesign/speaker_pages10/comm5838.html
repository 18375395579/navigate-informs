<br>Title: Balancing Growth and Bankruptcy Risk in a Cash-constrained Firm</br><br>Author: Vishal Gaur, Professor, Cornell University, Johnson School, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, vg77@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yasin Alan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A cash constrained firm has to balance growth and bankruptcy risk. We study the operational implications of this tradeoff in a finite horizon cash-constrained inventory model with non-stationary demand, which is a function of the firm’s past order quantities. We analyze four growth scenarios to capture the impact of financing constraints and the bankruptcy process on the firm’s stocking decisions.</br>
