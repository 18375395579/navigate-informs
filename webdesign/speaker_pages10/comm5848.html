<br>Title: Revenue Management with Bargaining</br><br>Author: Qi Feng, Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, 100 S. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, AnnabelleFeng@Purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Shanthikumar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the role of bargaining in a firm’s revenue management. The firm sells a fixed amount of stock to an arrival stream of potential buyers, who are heterogeneous in their valuation of the product.  In addition to dynamically adjusting the posted product price, the firm may also allow for price negotiation with the buyers. We focus on identifying the product characteristics that lead to significant value of incorporating bargaining into firm’s revenue management strategy.</br>
