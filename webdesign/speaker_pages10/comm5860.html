<br>Title: Managing Engineering Design for Competitive Sourcing in Closed-loop Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Tolga Aydinliyim, Lundquist College of Business, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, 97403, United States of America, tolga@uoregon.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the design (integral vs. partitioned) and procurement decisions of a buyer and its suppliers?pricing decisions.  The integral design requires more virgin materials and eliminates yield loss due to final joining. However, the simpler partitioned design allows a more competitive supplier base to rely less on reverse flows.</br>
