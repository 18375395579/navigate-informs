<br>Title: Demand Estimation and Ordering under Censoring: Stock-out Timing is (almost) All You Need</br><br>Author: Tong Wang, Assistant Professor, National University of Singapore, 15 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore, 119245, Singapore, tong.wang@nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aditya Jain, Nils Rudi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Retailers learn about demand by observing sales. However, this learning is limited by the amount of inventory a retailer carries. This loss of information due to censoring requires a retailer to carry excess inventory. We propose a new way of learning about demand with significantly simple sufficient statistics. We analyze this demand learning method for a simple multi-period Newsvendor setting. We provide a comparison between stock-out timing and stock-out event based demand updating.</br>
