<br>Title: The Role of Milestone-Based Contracts for Coordinating R&D Partnerships</br><br>Author: Sameer Hasija, INSEAD, Fontainbleau, France, sameer.hasija@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shantanu Bhattacharya, Vibha Gaba</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We analyze optimal contractual arrangements in a bilateral R&D partnership between a risk-averse provider that conducts early-stage research, followed by a regulatory verication stage, and a risk neutral client that performs late-stage development activities, including production, distribution, and marketing. The problem is formulated as a sequential investment game with the client as the principal, where the investments are observable but not veriable.</br>
