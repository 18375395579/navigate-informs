<br>Title: Random Yield Risk Sharing in a Two-level Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Jiang Zhang, Assistant Professor, Adelphi University, School of Business, Garden City, NY, 11530, United States, zhang@adelphi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuanjie He</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study a simple supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer where there are random yield production and uncertain demands. We propose several risk sharing contracts that distribute the random yield risk among parties and evaluate the supply chain performances. We also compare the results of proposed contracts and find that under certain conditions, yield randomness might enhance the supply chain performance and decrease the double marginalization effect.</br>
