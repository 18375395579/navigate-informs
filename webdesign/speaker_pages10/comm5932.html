<br>Title: Push or Pull?

Based on a news vendor model, we study the auction mechanism in which suppliers bid a single price, with or without a quantity committed by the buyer. That is, the buyer auctions a push or pull contract. We chracterize the environments in which a push or pull contract auction is preferred.</br>
