<br>Title: Risk-sensitive Supply Chain Coordination</br><br>Author: Danko Turcic, Dept. of Operations, Case Western Reserve University, Weatherhead School of Management, 330 Peter B Lewis Building, Cleveland, OH, 44106, United States, danko.turcic@case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Matthew Sobel</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: People are significantly sensitive to risk, but the definition of supply chain coordination presumes risk neutrality. With an extended definition we show that there is a coordinating contract even if the parties are not risk neutral.  Also, a systematic bias results from a widely invoked misspecification of time/risk preferences.</br>
