<br>Title: Inventory Balance</br><br>Author: Richa Agarwal, Amazon.com, richaa@amazon.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In contrast to a brick and mortar store, an online retailer has the flexibility to choose among its warehouses to fulfill a particular customer order. If the retailer is out-of-stock in warehouses close to the customer it would need to ship the order over longer distance resulting in higher shipping costs. Thus a balanced geographic distribution of inventory across multiple warehouses is very desirable. We present an LP based approach to define a metric to measure this balance. Further we discuss ways to modify our fulfillment choices based on the inventory balance to mitigate the impact of bad inventory positions on shipping costs.</br>
