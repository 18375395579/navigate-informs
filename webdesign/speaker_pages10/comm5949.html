<br>Title: Competition for Scarce Resources</br><br>Author: Peter Eso, Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, eso@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We show that if firms have symmetric technologies with decreasing returns to scale and buy inputs in an efficient auction, then their downstream competition becomes asymmetric. One firm will be large and inefficient, while the other firms will be small and profitable. The same is true even as the number of firms goes to infinity. Paradoxically, social welfare may fall as the supply of the valuable and scarce input is increased.</br>
