<br>Title: Optimal Capacity, Product Substitution, and Demand Models</br><br>Author: Juqi Liu, Ph.D Student, Virginia Tech, liujq@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rawee Suwandechochai, Ebru Bish</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a firm that produces two substitutable products. We consider linear demand models with cross-price effects under both additive and multiplicative shocks. The firm needs to make capacity, production, and pricing decisions.  While the capacity decision has to be made ex-ante, price and quantity decisions are ex-post. We study the relationship between different aggregate linear demand models and the optimal capacity as product substitution changes.</br>
