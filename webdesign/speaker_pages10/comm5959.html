<br>Title: Production Cost Forecasts and Procurement Efficiency in Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Tunay Tunca, Associate Professor, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, ttunca@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the role supplier cost forecasting under upstream competition in supply chain procurement and examine the implications on market and channel performance. We derive a channel competitiveness measure that combines the forecast information structure in the supply chain with upstream channel fragmentation and study its relationship with supply chain efficiency. We show that such a measure can be a better indicator of supply chain performance compared to traditional measures.</br>
