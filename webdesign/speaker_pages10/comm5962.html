<br>Title: Secondary and Tertiary Markets for Durable Products in Decentralized Channels</br><br>Author: Shuya Yin, Assistant Professor, Paul Merage School of Business, University of California, Irvine, syin@merage.uci.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Haresh Gurnani, Ray Saibal</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the joint effects of secondary market (retail buybacks) and tertiary markets on new product introduction and retail pricing strategies of durable products in a two-period decentralized channel framework. We show that frequent new product releases and high prices for durable products are actually due to interaction between the two markets.</br>
