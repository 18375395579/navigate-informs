<br>Title: Dynamic Supplier Contracts under Asymmetric Inventory Information</br><br>Author: Hao Zhang, University of Southern California, 3670 Trousdale Pkwy, Bridge Hall 401, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, zhanghao@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mahesh Nagarajan, Greys Sosic</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study a supplier-retailer chain with multiple periods. The supplier offers a single-period contract at the beginning of each period and the retailer places the order before demand realization. Inventory is carried over and unmet demand is lost. Inventory and realized demand can only be observed by the retailer. With certain assumptions, we show that selling in batches is optimal or near optimal for the supplier in order to reduce the retailer's information rent.</br>
