<br>Title: Optimal Procurement Auction with Sequential Supplier Qualification</br><br>Author: Wei Chen, PhD Student, Jindal School of Management, The University of Texas at Dallas, 800 W. Campbell Road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, wei.chen@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ganesh Janakiraman, Milind Dawande</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A firm is soliciting price bids for a sourcing contract from N suppliers.  The contract can only be awarded to a supplier who passes two rounds of qualification/testing, which can be performed sequentially or simultaneously. We study a two period optimal mechanism design problem in which some suppliers take the first test in the first period and some among the successful take the second test in the second period, and some of the untested suppliers take the integrated test in the second period.</br>
