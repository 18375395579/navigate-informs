<br>Title: A Capacitated Commodity Trading Model with Market Power</br><br>Author: Victor Martinez de Albeniz, Assistant Professor, IESE Business School, Av. Pearson 21, Barcelona, 08034, Spain, valbeniz@iese.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Josep Maria Vendrell Sim?</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the operational problem of a trader between two markets of the same commodity, each one of which quotes a different price. We are interested in finding the optimal trading policy across the markets so as to obtain the maximum profit in the long-term, assuming that the trading volumes influence the price processes. We assume a finite trading capacity (fixed inventory level) and proportional costs. We determine the optimal trading strategy and the optimal capacity to be installed.</br>
