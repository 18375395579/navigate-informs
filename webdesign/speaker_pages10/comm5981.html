<br>Title: Inventory Misplacement and RFID</br><br>Author: Almula Camdereli, Georgetown University, McDonough School of Business, Georgetown University, 37 & O Streets, Washington, DC, 20057, United States of America, zac2@georgetown.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jayashankar Swaminathan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study benefits of RFID implementation on a two stage supply chain experiencing misplaced inventory at the retailer in three settings: a vertically integrated, a decentralized supply chain with a wholesale contract and a supply chain that is coordinated with a revenue sharing contract. We consider both fixed and variable costs for RFID implementation and assume that the fixed cost is shared between the two using an arbitrary proportion while the variable cost could be charged to either party.</br>
