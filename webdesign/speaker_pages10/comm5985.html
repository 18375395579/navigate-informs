<br>Title: A Riskless-price Heuristic for the Newsvendor</br><br>Author: Guillaume Roels, UCLA, Anderson School of Management, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States of America, groels@anderson.ucla.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We revisit the problem of the newsvendor with pricing. Using worst-case bounds over all demand probability distributions, we demonstrate that it is relatively robust to price at the riskless price, both for the additive and the multiplicative demand models. We then show that the loss of optimality is generally within a few percents from the optimal profit. Our analysis generates new insights into the role of pricing as a hedge against demand uncertainty and its relation to safety stocks.</br>
