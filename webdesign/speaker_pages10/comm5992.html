<br>Title: A Model for Estimating Systematic Risk in Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Vishal Gaur, Professor of Operations Management, Johnson School, Cornell University, 321 Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, vg77@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nikolay Osadchiy, Sridhar Seshadri</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The demand uncertainty faced by a firm can be caused by idiosyncratic factors or systematic economic factors. We investigate how systematic risk propagates through supply chain networks using industry-level data for the manufacturing, wholesale trade, and retail trade sectors of the U.S. economy. Our results have implications for the relative value of operational and financial hedging strategies used by firms.</br>
