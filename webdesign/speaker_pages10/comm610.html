        <br>Title: Quadratic Rules for Selecting Core Outcomes in Combinatorial Auctions</br><br>Author: Robert Day, University of Connecticut, bob.day@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Milgrom</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Most auctions for one item have the core property, i.e., no mutually profitable renegotiation is available. Using a quadratic core-selection rule in the combinatorial setting, we achieve other beneficial properties, including strict shill-proofness, a unique dual-like payment decomposition, and adjustable auction parameters to account for market asymmetries. Spectrum auction implementations are discussed.</br>
