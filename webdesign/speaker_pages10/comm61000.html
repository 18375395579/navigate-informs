        <br>Title: Dynamic Pricing for Hotel Management with Multiple-day Stays</br><br>Author: Yun Fong Lim, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, 50 Stamford Road, 178899, Singapore, yflim@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Qing Ding, Kum Khiong Yang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a hotel with a single type of rooms. Customers check the rental rate of a room for a multiple-day period. Depending on the availability and rental rate of a room each customer may make a reservation or turn away. The rental rate is updated according to demand   and the remaining capacity of the hotel. We propose a model to dynamically determine the rental rate so that the hotel's revenue is maximized.</br>
