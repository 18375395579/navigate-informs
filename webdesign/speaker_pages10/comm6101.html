        <br>Title: Optimal Internet Auctions with Costly Communication</br><br>Author: Yuqian Li, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States of America, yuqian@cs.duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vincent Conitzer</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose an explicit cost model that is inspired by single-item Internet auctions, such as those taking place on auction sites (eBay) or via informal communication (craigslist, mailing lists). A nonzero bid comes at a cost to both the seller and the bidder, and the seller can send broadcast queries at a cost. We consider multi-round Vickrey auctions (MVAs) in this context, in which the seller runs multiple Vickrey auctions, with decreasing reserve prices.</br>
