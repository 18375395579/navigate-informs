        <br>Title: Determining NHL Player Types and Point Shares</br><br>Author: Timothy Chan, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Rd, Toronto, Canada, tcychan@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Novati</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we present a methodology using clustering, projection and regression analyses to determine distinct NHL player types and measure players?individual contributions to overall team performance.  We apply our method to historical NHL player data at the season level.  Initial results suggest that our point share values are aligned with perceptions of “goodness?of a hockey player.  In particular, players with the highest point share values tend to win major NHL awards.</br>
