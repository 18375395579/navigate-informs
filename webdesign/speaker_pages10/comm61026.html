        <br>Title: Network Volatility</br><br>Author: Qingqing Huang, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bldg 32-D760, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, qqh@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We address the problem of identifying the most volatile node in a network. For a networked dynamic system in the presence of exogenous disturbances, we propose a measure of volatility at each node. We show how this measure depends on the structural properties of the underlying network, parameterized by an undirected graph. We investigate some stylized graphs and compare our measure against other measures. We also propose a distributed algorithm to compute the measure for large scale networks.</br>
