        <br>Title: Incentive-compatible Distributed Routing</br><br>Author: Michael Schapira, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel, mikesch@cs.huji.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aviv Zohar, Hagay Levin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a game-theoretic model of interdomain routing in today's Internet. The model enables complex dynamic interactions between the agents (asynchronous, sequential, and based on partial-information). We provide realistic conditions that guarantee that greedy and myopic behaviour is in the best interest of each of the players.</br>
