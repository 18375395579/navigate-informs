        <br>Title: Blind Queues: The Impact of Consumer Beliefs on Revenues and Congestion</br><br>Author: Shiliang Cui, Doctoral Student, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, scui@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Senthil Veeraraghavan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In many service settings, consumers have to join a queue without being fully aware of service parameters. In such blind queues, consumers make their decisions based on limited information. We consider a firm serving consumers with arbitrarily misinformed beliefs about the firm's service information, and explore how firm revenues and consumer welfare are impacted if the firm were to reveal its service parameters.</br>
