        <br>Title: Utility Indifference Valuation of Weather Derivatives and Their Hedge Effect on Energy Businesses</br><br>Author: Yuji Yamada, Associate Professor, Graduate School of Business Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 3-29-1 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 112-0012, Japan, yuji@gssm.otsuka.tsukuba.ac.jp</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop two types of pricing approaches based on the utility indifference valuation and the non-parametric trend prediction, and estimate their hedge effect on energy businesses using empirical data. First, we consider an OTC market for weather derivatives between an insurance company and an industry that run a project affected by a weather index, and derive the equilibrium price and volume. We then analyze the hedge effect of weather derivatives on energy businesses.</br>
