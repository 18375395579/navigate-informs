        <br>Title: Display Advertising with an Ad Exchange and Prediction Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Eric Sodomka, Brown University, 115 Waterman Street, Providence, RI, 02912, United States of America, sodomka@cs.brown.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Max Lin, Vahab Mirrokni</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Publishers in display advertising face difficult challenges in both prediction and optimization. A publisher must predict what users will arrive to its site and how bidders on an ad exchange  will respond to different reserve prices. The publisher must then decide, as each impression arrives, how to set reserve prices and which ads to show to maximize its long-term expected profit. We propose and evaluate algorithms for acting in this domain with uncertainty in predictions.</br>
