        <br>Title: Optimal Order Routing in a Fragmented Market</br><br>Author: Hua Zheng, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, hzheng14@gsb.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ciamac Moallemi, Costis Maglaras</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In modern equity markets traders have the choice of many exchanges, each operating as an electronic limit order book. We find that the equilibrium of this decentralized market exhibits a state space collapse property as a result of smart order routing. Analysis of a TAQ dataset provides strong empirical support for SSC. PCA show significant dimension reduction of delay trajectories, while regressions verify simple linear relations. Our estimates explain most of the variability in trading delays.</br>
