        <br>Title: Deterministic, Dominant Strategy Auctions for Deliberative Agents: A Characterization and an Impossibility Result</br><br>Author: David R.M. Thompson, University of British Columbia, 2366 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada, daveth@cs.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Leyton-Brown</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Can we make deterministic, dominant strategy auctions for agents whose private information is costly to discover?  Given independent private values, only a series of take-it-or-leave-it offers will work.  But even this mechanism will not have a dominant strategy equilibrium when values are interdependent or agents are capable of learning about each other's preferences.  However, both of these restrictions can be overcome by randomizing.</br>
