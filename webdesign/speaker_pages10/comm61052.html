        <br>Title: Delaying the Revelation of Information in a Social Learning Model</br><br>Author: Kostas Bimpikis, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, kostasb@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kimon Drakopoulos</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a model of strategic experimentation motivated by collective decision making with costly information acquisition or R&D and the innovation process.  When the outcomes of experimentation are observable, free-riding results in inefficiently low experimentation. When an information aggregator holds all  information and commits when to reveal it, efficiency increases.</br>
