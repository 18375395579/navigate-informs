        <br>Title: Integrating Revenue Management Systems with Recommendation Engines: An Application for Sheraton</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A hotel room is an experience good: the customers do NOT know the product before arriving at the hotel. Sheraton does not know the customer and the purpose of her visit; this makes it difficult to recommend a room. A customer who is interested in exploring a range of options is likely to do so by going to expedia; however, this will make the customer search ACROSS hotels. The study addresses the three shortcomings in the hotel's RM system which has to be coordinated with customer search.</br>
