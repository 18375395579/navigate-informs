        <br>Title: Quantifying Bid Shading in Online Auctions via A Functional Approach</br><br>Author: Galit Shmueli, Assistant Professor, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, gshmueli@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ravi Bapna, Wolfgang Jank</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Winner's curse is a property of common-value auctions where the winner overbids if he bids his truthful value. To avoid over-bidding, bidders must shade their bid. Bid shading has been investigated empirically by several authors. We show that the current test, a regression model that uses only bids from the auction end, has several shortcomings. Our proposed method is based on a functional representation of an auction. It better captures the data structure and models bid dynamics directly.</br>
