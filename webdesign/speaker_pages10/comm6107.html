        <br>Title: Optimal Continuous Pricing with Strategic Consumers</br><br>Author: Luis Briceno, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile, lbriceno@dim.uchile.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jose Correa</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: An important problem in electronic commerce is that of ending an optimal mechanism to sell a single item when the number of bidders is random. In this paper we take a step further and derive an optimal pricing scheme when consumers arrive over time according to a random process. Combining auction theory and recent work on pricing with strategic consumers, we derive the optimal pricing mechanism in this situation under mild conditions.</br>
