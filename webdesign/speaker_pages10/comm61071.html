Smith School of Business, Decision and Information Technologies, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, ikaraes@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yingjie Lan, Huina Gao, Michael Ball</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the single resource (leg) revenue management problem when no or limited demand information is available.

We further test the average performance of these policies are using extensive computational experiments.</br>
