        <br>Title: Dynamic Demand Management via Smart Grids</br><br>Author: Pavithra Harsha, Research Staff Member, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, 34-225, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, pharsha@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mayank Sharma, Soumyadip Ghosh, Ramesh Natarajan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Demand management as a way to modulate the aggregate load using ‘price incentive signals?to find the lowest cost supply-demand match is of considerable interest in the emerging smart grids. We formulate the demand management problem as a price-sensitive newsvendor and present results for various types of demand response schemes that differ with the type and form of the signals, providing insights into the practical design of such schemes.</br>
