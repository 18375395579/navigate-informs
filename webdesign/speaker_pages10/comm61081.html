        <br>Title: Efficiency of Subsidy Schemes in Reducing Waiting Times for Public Health Services</br><br>Author: Qu (Alex) Qian, Assistant Professor, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, 777 Guoding Road, School of International Business Adm, Shanghai, 200433, China, qian.qu@mail.shufe.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pengfei Guo</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the efficiency of two typical subsidy schemes used in health care systems: unconditional and conditional. For each subsidy scheme we consider two information scenarios, no and full, that represent situations in which customers observe no realtime  delay information and workload, respectively. We find that preferences for the two subsidy schemes depend on the information scenario and the size of the public fund.</br>
