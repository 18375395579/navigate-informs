        <br>Title: A Puck in the Net Beats Four Men in the Box</br><br>Author: Ed Kaplan, Yale School of Management, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States of America, edward.kaplan@yale.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin Mongeon, John Ryan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The classic Poisson model of hockey provides a simple method for calculating the probability of a team winning a hockey game given the score differential and time remaining to play.  We extend this model to include the effect of penalties by expanding the model state space to include manpower differential in addition to score differential and remaining time.  Given data from the 2008-2011 National Hockey League seasons (a total of 4,920 games), we derive and report the associated state-space model.  The modeling shows that, for any fixed duration of time left in the game, the probability that a team leading by g goals playing two men down wins is higher than the probability that a team leading by g-1 goals playing two men up wins, explaining the title of the paper.</br>
