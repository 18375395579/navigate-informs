        <br>Title: Finding Better Pricing Strategies For Electricity</br><br>Author: Mingguo Hong, Midwest ISO, 5407 Alvamar Place, Carmel, IN, 46033, United States of America, mingguoh@hotmail.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The Location Marginal Price (LMP) based electricity market design has an inherent weakness in that it cannot guarantee the recovery of a generator’s startup and no load costs.

This talk reviews the market design changes. It intends to reveal issues with LMP pricing and solicit alternative problem solutions.</br>
