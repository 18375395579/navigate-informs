        <br>Title: Overpayment in Set-system Auctions</br><br>Author: Edith Elkind, eelkind@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kenneth Steiglitz, Paul Goldberg, Amit Sahai, Leslie Goldberg</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In set-system auctions, there is a task than can be completed by  several overlapping teams of agents, and the center's goal is  to hire one of these teams and pay as little as possible. Examples of  this setting include shortest path auctions, minimum spanning tree  auctions, and vertex cover auctions. In this talk, we discuss several  approaches to reducing the total payment of the center in this  setting, and the associated computational challenges.</br>
