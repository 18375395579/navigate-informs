        <br>Title: Consumer Behavior in Waiting for Last-minute Discounts</br><br>Author: Anton Ovchinnikov, Darden School of Business, University of Virginia, 100 Darden Blvd, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States, aovchinnikov@darden.virginia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Milner</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the behavior of customers who strategically decide whether to purchase early at full price or wait for a discount in response to a firm’s practice of putting some inventory on sale.  We suggest game theoretic and heuristic models of consumer behavior and compare their predictions with wait-or-buy decisions of real people obtained from an on-line simulation. We discuss suboptimalities in these decisions and analyze their implications for the firm’s revenue management policy.</br>
