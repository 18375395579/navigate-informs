        <br>Title: Network Design and Allocation Mechanisms for Carrier Alliances in Liner Shipping</br><br>Author: Ozlem Ergun, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, oergun@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richa Agarwal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many real world systems operate in a decentralized manner. We study transportation networks that operate as an alliance. In particular, we study alliance formation among carriers in liner shipping. We utilize optimization and game theory concepts and design a mechanism to guide the carriers in an alliance to pursue an optimal collaborative strategy. The mechanism provides side payments to the carriers motivating them to act in the alliance best interest while maximizing their own profits.</br>
