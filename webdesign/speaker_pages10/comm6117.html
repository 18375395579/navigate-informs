        <br>Title: Revenue-monotonicity in Combinatorial Auctions</br><br>Author: Marion Ott, RWTH Aachen University, Templergraben 64, Aachen, 52062, Germany, marion.ott@rwth-aachen.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marissa Beck</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Under what conditions does revenue in sealed-bid combinatorial auctions decrease when bids increase?

In the Vickrey auction and in Minimum-Revenue Core-Selecting Auctions this counterintuitive phenomenon may appear even if we restrict bidders' values to be submodular and under further restrictions.</br>
