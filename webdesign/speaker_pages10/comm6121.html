        <br>Title: Monotonicity in Revenue Management under a Discrete Choice Model of Consumer Behavior</br><br>Author: Yasushi Masuda, Professor, Keio Univerisity, Faculty of Science & Technology, Yokohama, 223-8522, Japan, masuda@ae.keio.ac.jp</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hideo Miki</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine monotonicity properties of expected revenue w.r.t. the consumer behavior and the market size. The consumer behavior is described by a general discrete choice model. The control problem is to decide which subset of fare products to offer at each time period. An example shows that a usual stochastic order in consumers' preference over the fare products is not sufficient for the intuitive monotonicity to hold true. We provide sufficient conditions for the monotonicity.</br>
