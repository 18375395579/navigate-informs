        <br>Title: Bid Optimization in Online Advertisement Auctions</br><br>Author: Omid Etesami, University of California, Berkeley, 2299 Piedmont Avenue, Berkeley, CA, United States, etesami@EECS.Berkeley.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Borgs, Nicole Immorlica, Mohammad Mahdian, Jennifer Chayes, Kamal Jain</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study online keyword advertising auctions among bidders with limited budgets, and propose a bidding heuristic to optimize the utility for each bidder by equalizing its return-on-investment across keywords. We study the equilibrium of a system in which every bidder is using this heuristic, and show that if small random perturbations are added to the first price mechanism, the system provably converges to the market equilibrium.</br>
