        <br>Title: What Contributes to the High Cost of College Textbooks?</br><br>Author: Haresh Gurnani, Professor, University of Miami, 417B Jenkins Building, Department of Management, Coral Gables, FL, 33124, United States of America, haresh@miami.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shuya Yin, Saibal Ray</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a decentralized supply chain comprising of a bookstore and a textbook publisher. The bookstore decides the buyback price for used books and can also buy unused books from the publisher for sale to students. The publisher decides whether to publish a new edition (at a cost) or not to release a new edition, and accordingly sets the wholesale price. Our analysis sheds light on the role that buybacks and/or new edition releases play on soaring prices in the college textbook industry.</br>
