        <br>Title: Impact of Price Matching Policy on Pricing, Inventory Investment and Profit</br><br>Author: Laurens Debo, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, laurdebo@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guoming Lai</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Strategic consumers may postpone a purchase in anticipation of future markdowns. With a price matching policy, a seller commits reimbursing the price difference to a customer that bought before the seller marked down the product. This paper examines the impact of a price matching policy on the consumers' purchasing behavior, the seller's pricing strategy, inventory investment and profit.</br>
