        <br>Title: Competitive Equilibrium in Two Sided Matching Markets with General Utility Functions</br><br>Author: Saeed Alaei, University of Maryland, 4315 Rowalt Dr, APT 201, College Park, MD, 20740, United States of America, saeed.a@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Azarakhsh Malekian, Kamal Jain</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present the first exact characterization of prices/payoffs at competitive equilibria in two sided matching  markets with non-quasilinear utilities. The problem has been studied extensively (e.g. Demange, Gale,  Quinzii, etc), however no constructive proof of existence and/or characterization was known for equilibria.    We also derive a mechanism for Ad-Auctions which does not rely on the assumption that advertisers and search  engine have the same belief about clickthrough rates.</br>
