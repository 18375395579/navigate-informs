        <br>Title: The Role and Impact of the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) in Prescription Drug Marketing</br><br>Author: Ozden Gur Ali, Koc University, Sariyer, Istanbul, Turkey, oali@ku.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Murali Mantrala, Burak Cavdaroglu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We model the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)'s formulary tier assignment decisions in response to rebates, physician detailing activities and direct to consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical companies. We find that not only discount offers, but also pull marketing give incentive to the rebate-maximizing PBM to prefer a drug. These findings run counter to the common assumptions that the PBMs would necessarily favor lower-priced brands with lower detailing and/or DTC advertising spending.</br>
