        <br>Title: Monotone Properties of Wholesale Price Contracts</br><br>Author: Vera Tilson, Asssistant Professor, University of Rochester, Simon School of Business, Rochester, NY, United States, Vera.Tilson@case.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We focus on monotonicity properties of wholesale price -- performing qualitative sensitivity analysis using order-theoretical framework. We establish sufficient conditions that guarantee monotone changes in contract parameters with changes in exogenous parameters.  Many specific cases are encompassed by the assumptions including randomness in both yield and demand</br>
