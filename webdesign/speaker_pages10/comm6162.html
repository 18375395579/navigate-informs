        <br>Title: Cyclic Pricing and Strategic Waiting in the Air-Travel Industry</br><br>Author: Jun Li, Assistant Professor, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, junwli@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Serguei Netessine</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Will consumers wait longer or shorter in face of volatile prices? Using individual-level web visitation and transaction data in the air-travel industry, we are able to observe not only the time of purchase but also the length of waiting before committing to a purchase. The study reveals a cyclical pricing pattern in the air-travel industry, and sheds light on the optimality of such pricing strategy based on the corresponding waiting patterns observed from strategic consumers.</br>
