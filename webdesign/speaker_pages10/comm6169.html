        <br>Title: Dynamic Pricing without Priors</br><br>Author: Rene Caldentey, New York University, Stern School of Business, 44 West Fourth Street, New York, United States of America, rcaldent@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ying Liu, Ilan Lobel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the pricing problem faced by a monopolist selling to a population of consumers over a discrete-time horizon. Customers are heterogeneous along two dimensions: (1) willingness-to-pay and (2) arrival time. The seller has limited information about demand, knowing only the support of customers' valuation.  We characterize a robust pricing policy, which minimizes the seller's regret defined as the difference between her payoff under full demand information and her realized payoff.</br>
