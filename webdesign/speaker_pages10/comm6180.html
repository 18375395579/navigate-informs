        <br>Title: Value-based Pricing for Emerging IT Services</br><br>Author: Robert Harmon, Professor of Marketing and Technology Management, School of Business Administration, Portland State University, P.O. Box 751, Portland, OR, 97207, United States of America, harmonr@pdx.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Haluk Demirkan, Bill Hefley, Nora Auseklis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Pricing strategies for IT services have traditionally focused on the service provider’s internal business value objectives such as ROI and meeting the competition.  Conversely, value-based pricing methods recognize that pricing strategy needs to consider the customer’s perceived value when setting prices.  This paper surveys the literature on IT services pricing and presents a value-based approach that offers insights on how to effectively price emerging network-based IT service solutions.</br>
