        <br>Title: A Discrete Choice Approach to Measuring Travel Website's Screen Quality and Predicting Market Share</br><br>Author: Hai Jiang, Travelocity.com, 3150 Sabre Dr, A2-616, Southlake, TX, 76092, United States of America, hai.jiang@sabre.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Presenting desirable flights to customers is essential to an air travel website's success. We use discrete choice models to measure screen quality, ie, the overall desirability of flights displayed on a screen. We first generate a screen quality metric called selection probability by comparing the host website to a reference website. We then introduce website-specific constants to capture unobserved effects. Experiments show that our approach generates accurate predictions.</br>
