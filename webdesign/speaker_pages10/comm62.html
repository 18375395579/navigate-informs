        <br>Title: Music for a Song: An Empirical Look at Uniform Song Pricing and its Alternatives</br><br>Author: Joel Waldfogel, Professor, Wharton, 1405 ShDh, The Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, waldfogj@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ben Shiller</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We explore various song pricing schemes, including song-specific pricing, bundling, and third-degree price discrimination, using survey-based data. We find that revenue could be increased by a tenth while maintaining consumer surplus at the high level accompanying current $0.99 uniform song pricing.  Even with sophisticated pricing, however, much of the area under the demand curve for this product cannot be appropriated as revenue.</br>
