        <br>Title: Optimal Order Routing in a Fragmented Market</br><br>Author: Hua Zheng, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, hzheng14@gsb.columbia.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In modern equity markets, participants have a choice of many exchanges at which to trade. Exchanges typically operate as electronic limit order books operating under the “price-time?priority rule. Taking into account the effect of investors?order routing decisions, we find that the equilibrium of this decentralized market exhibits a certain state space collapse property, whereby (a) the states at different exchanges are coupled in a fairly intuitive manner, (b) the behavior of the market is captured through a one-dimensional process that can be viewed as a weighted aggregate depth of the market at the best bid and offer, and (c) the behavior of the various exchanges is inferred through a set of simple mappings from that of the aggregated market depth process. This predicted dimension reduction is the result of high-frequency order routing decisions that essentially couple the dynamics across exchanges. We derive a characterization of the market equilibrium and the associated aggregated depth process. Analyzing a TAQ dataset for a sample of stocks over a one month period, we find strong support for the predicted state space collapse property.</br>
