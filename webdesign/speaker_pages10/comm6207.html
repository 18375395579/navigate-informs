        <br>Title: Bayesian Optimal Mechanism Design via Multi to Single Agent Reduction</br><br>Author: Saeed Alaei, Postdoctoral Researcher, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States of America, saeed.a@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hu Fu, Nima Haghpanah, Jason D. Hartline, Azarakhsh Malekian</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We reduce the Bayesian optimal multi agent mechanism design problem to single agent problems in environments  where the space of jointly feasible allocations is captured by a polymatroid. Our reduction works by  optimizing over the space of feasible interim allocation rules (a.k.a reduced form auctions). We characterize  the space of feasible interim allocation rules as a polymatroid, generalizing the result of Border(1991). We  present an application of our result to display advertising.</br>
