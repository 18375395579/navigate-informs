        <br>Title: Sponsored Search Auctions with Markovian Users</br><br>Author: Jon Feldman, Google Research, NYC, 76 Ninth Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, NY, 10011, United States of America, jonfeld@google.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Martin Pal, Gagan Aggarwal, S Muthukrishnan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Sponsored search involves running an auction among advertisers who bid to have their ad shown next to search results at various positions.  The value of these positions depends on how the search engine user interacts with the search results page.  We propose a new Markovian model for this interaction, and present an algorithm to determine the most efficient ad assignment under this model.  We show that this assignment has many desirable incentive properties that make bidding strategy intuitive.</br>
