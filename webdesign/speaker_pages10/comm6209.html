        <br>Title: On the Existence of E-loyalty Networks in eBay Auctions and Their Structure</br><br>Author: Inbal Yahav, UMD, 4358 VMH, RH Smith School of Business, College Park, United States of America, iyahav@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wolfgang Jank</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We investigate loyalty in online auction bidder-seller networks. Generating loyalty in online auctions is hard because of sellers' limited ability to influence bidder behavior. We study dynamics between sellers and bidders in the form of networks. We investigate the structure of networks, their differences and their impact on the auction outcome. We discuss heterogeneity in bidders' preferences and differences to fixed price purchases.</br>
