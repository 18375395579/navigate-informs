        <br>Title: Pricing a Bestseller: Sales and Visibility in the Marketplace for Mobile Apps</br><br>Author: Bar Ifrach, Postdoctoral Researcher, Stanford University, Huang Engineering Center Room 258, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, Ca, 94305, United States of America, bifrach@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ramesh Johari</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The market for mobile apps has shown exceptional growth since its launching, exceeding 100 billion app downloads. Taking a combined data-driven and structural approach, the paper focuses on the relationship between pricing decisions and marketplace visibility. We find a strong visibility effect of top ranked charts displayed in the marketplace. Thus motivated, we study a dynamic pricing model and find that this effect supports price cycles, a commonly observed pricing technique in the market.</br>
