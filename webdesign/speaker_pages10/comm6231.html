        <br>Title: Quantifying the Loss of Profit in Price Competition for Differentiated Products</br><br>Author: Georgia Perakis, Associate Professor, Sloan School, MIT, 50 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, georgiap@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Amr Farahat</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We provide bounds on the ratio of decentralized to centralized profits in price competitive markets with substitutable differentiated products.  The lower bound is based on the minimum eigenvalue of the demand sensitivity matrix and the upper bound is based on comparing diagonal elements of two derived matrices. We then develop simpler bounds based on the maximum market clout. We show this bound is typically not too large.</br>
