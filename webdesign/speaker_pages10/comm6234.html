        <br>Title: The Impact of Promotion Optimization</br><br>Author: Maxime Cohen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, maxcohen@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kiran Panchamgam, Georgia Perakis, Zachary Leung, Tony Smith</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the Promotion Optimization Problem, i.e. deciding which items to promote and at what price. Our formulation includes several business rules that arise in practice. We build demand models from data in order to capture the stockpiling behavior through dependence on past prices. This gives rise to a hard problem. For general additive and multiplicative demand structures, we propose efficient LP based methods, show theoretical performance guarantees and validate our results using real data.</br>
