        <br>Title: Optimal Seamless Self-Assembly of Files in Linear Networks</br><br>Author: Andreas Constantinides, Columbia University, EE Department, New York, NY, United States, acc40@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): E. G. Coffman, Jr.</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A file F is sited at one end of a path, in which each node may act as a client for F, and may cache subsets of F. In the seamless, self-assembly (SSA) paradigm, all clients issue requests simultaneously, each starts to receive segments of F immediately, and continues to receive them until F is fully downloaded. We exhibit a distributed protocol that assigns segments of F to caches in such a way that, no matter which nodes are chosen as clients, SSA is realized with a minimum total cache size.</br>
