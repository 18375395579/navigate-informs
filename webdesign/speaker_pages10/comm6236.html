        <br>Title: The Economics of the Cloud: Price Competition and Congestion</br><br>Author: Yunjian Xu, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Engineering Systems and Design, Singapore, Singapore, xuyunjian@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jonatha Anselmi, Danilo Ardagna, John C.S. Liu, Adam Wierman, Zichao Yang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper proposes a model to capture a marketplace with users purchasing services from Software-as-Service (SaaS) providers, which in turn purchase computing resources from either Provider-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers.  We define and characterize market equilibria. Further, we use these characterizations to study the profitability of SaaSs and PaaSs/IaaSs, and to understand the impact of price competition on user experienced performance.</br>
