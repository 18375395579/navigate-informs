        <br>Title: House Allocation with Indifferences: A Generalization and a Unified View</br><br>Author: Daniela Saban, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, dhs2131@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Sethuraman</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of reallocating indivisible objects amongst a set of agents when the preferences may contain indifferences and study how the well-know results for strict preferences can be generalized to this setting. We provide a general framework to design strategyproof mechanisms that find a Pareto optimal allocation in the weak-core. We establish sufficient conditions for a mechanism to be strategyproof and use them to design fast algorithms for finding good'' reallocations.</br>
