        <br>Title: Comparing Price and Quantity Competition in Oligopolies with Differentiated Products</br><br>Author: Amr Farahat, Johnson School, Cornell, Ithaca, NY, United States, aaf33@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider an oligopoly market with more than two firms offering gross substitutes. We illustrate that while prices under Cournot competition remain higher than under Bertrand competition, the profit relationship is more complex and depends on the number of firms, their degree of market power, and quality differences among them. We examine several affine demand models and provide counterexamples where Bertrand profits can exceed Cournot profits along with an upper bound on the profit ratio.</br>
