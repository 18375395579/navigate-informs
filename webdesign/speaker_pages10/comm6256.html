        <br>Title: Price Dispersion in Electricity Auctions: Strategic Analysis and Economic Implications</br><br>Author: Shanshan Hu, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, E0401 (PhD Office), Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States, husz@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Roman Kapuscinski, William Lovejoy</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: High volatility of electricity prices leads to the practice of risk management and a policy debate on market design, particularly the selection between discriminatory auction and uniform auction. We show that price dispersion stems from suppliers' exercising market power through randomized bidding, and such power is characterized by capacity utilization and technological asymmetry. The two auctions are approximately revenue equivalent but discriminatory auction results in lower price volatility.</br>
