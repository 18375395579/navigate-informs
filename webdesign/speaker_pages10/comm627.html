        <br>Title: Finding the Hidden Cost of Control</br><br>Author: Stephen Leider, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, leider@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Judd Kessler</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Intrinsic motivation and/or social norms can lead to pro-social behavior in the absence of explicit incentives, while increased monitoring and/or fines can often destroy intrinsic motivation.  In this paper we replicate the “hidden cost of control?result of Falk and Kosfeld (2006) for a setting with informal agreements, and demonstrate that the hidden cost is eliminated when the binding minimum affects both parties and reversed when both parties must agree upon the minimum.</br>
