        <br>Title: The Power of VCG: On Algorithms That are Maximal in Range</br><br>Author: Sharar Dobzinski, Hebrew University, CS dept, Givat Ram Campus, Jerusalem, Israel, shahard@cs.huji.ac.il</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consider the following simple type of approximation algorithms: limit the set of possible outcomes, and completely optimize over the restricted subrange. We study the power of these algorithms in two settings: multi-unit auctions, and combinatorial auctions with subadditive bidders.    From a game-theoretic perspective, our results characterize of the power of VCG. We will also discuss the connection of our results to proving lower bounds on the power of poly-time truthful mechanisms.</br>
