        <br>Title: Preference Markets Vs. Simple Surveys of Expectations of Others' Preferences</br><br>Author: Ely Dahan, Assistant Professor of Marketing, UCLA, The Anderson School at UCLA, 110 Westwood Plaza, Office B514, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States of America, edahan@ucla.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss the predictive accuracy of Preference Markets, in which product concepts and attributes are traded as stocks.  An alternative, a survey of expectations of others' preferences, is also considered.  Empirical results in the case of cell phones, vehicles, laptop bags, and student projects show that while both approaches are surprisingly effective, each has its own advantages.  Respondents' incentives to be truthful and potential pitfalls for these approaches are also discussed.</br>
