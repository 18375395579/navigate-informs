St. Louis Ave., Chicago, IL, 60625, United States of America, M-Polyashuk@neiu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper focuses on several decision making situations facing a Major League Baseball (MLB) team manager in his everyday work: selection of the 9-player set for a batting lineup on any given game day, deciding on the batting order, and selecting a substitute player while a game is in progress.  In order to offer decision making tools for solving these problems, we will apply multiple criteria methods, graph theory, and statistical analyses.</br>
