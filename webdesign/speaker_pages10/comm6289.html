        <br>Title: Core-selecting Auctions with Incomplete Information</br><br>Author: Oleg Baranov, Assistant Professor, University of Colorado at Boulder, Department of Economics, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO, 80309, United States of America, Oleg.Baranov@Colorado.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence Ausubel</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple incomplete-information model which allows us to do a full equilibrium analysis for four different core-selecting auction formats suggested in the literature. We find that the revenues and efficiency from core-selecting auctions improve as correlations among bidders?values increase, while the revenues from the Vickrey auction worsen. Thus, there may be good reasons for policymakers to utilize core-selecting auctions rather than a VCG in realistic environments.</br>
