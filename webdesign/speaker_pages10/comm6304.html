        <br>Title: An Empirical Analysis of Bidding Behavior in Overlapping Online Auctions</br><br>Author: Lin Hao, Assistant Professor, University of Notre Dame, Mendoza College of Business, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, United States of America, lhao@nd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Arvind Tripathi, Yong Tan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper studied bidding behavior in overlapping online auctions. We investigated how bidders choose their bids when multiple identical auctions are running concurrently. We identified factors affecting bidders?decisions on which auction to bid. We also revealed how single-unit demand bidder’s bidding behavior differs from multi-unit demand bidder’s. We develop an empirical model to estimate those issues using the overlapping online auction data.</br>
