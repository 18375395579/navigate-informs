        <br>Title: Strategic Bidding in Reverse Split-award Auctions</br><br>Author: Kemal Guler, Hewlett Packard Labs, 1501 Page Mill, Palo Alto, CA, United States of America, kemal.guler@hp.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaoyong Zheng, Stefan Mayer, Martin Bichler</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop two competing first-price sealed-bid procurement auctions for selling a bundle of products through two lots with different sizes. We find that though the two auction mechanisms yield the same expected procurement costs to the buyer, other aspects of the two models, including the equilibrium bidding strategies as well as winning bidders?ex post profits differ significantly. The Bayesian-Nash equilibrium bid function also serves as a good predictor for bidding strategies in the lab.</br>
