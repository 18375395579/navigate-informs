        <br>Title: Preferences, Homophily, and Social Learning</br><br>Author: Evan Sadler, NYU Stern School of Business, 44 W 4th Street, 8-154K, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, esadler@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ilan Lobel</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study homophily in a Bayesian model of social learning. Prior theory finds that diverse preferences are beneficial, while homophily slows learning. However, this conflicts with empirical findings. We explain the discrepancy in terms of network density. Our model agrees with existing theory and with empirical findings when networks are dense and sparse respectively. Further results suggest that homophily is unlikely to impede learning and can be beneficial in networks with dense components.</br>
