        <br>Title: An Analysis of Scoring and Buyer-determined Procurement Auctions</br><br>Author: Natalia Santamaría Tobar, Universidad de Los Andes, Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Bogot? Colombia, n-santam@uniandes.edu.co</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: I compare two procurement auction formats (in terms of the expected cost for the buyer) in which an incumbent competes with a group of entrants. A scoring auction in which suppliers compete on the adjusted bids or scores, and, a buyer-determined auction in which suppliers compete on the price, and the buyer adjusts the bids with the non-price attributes after the auction to determine the winner.</br>
