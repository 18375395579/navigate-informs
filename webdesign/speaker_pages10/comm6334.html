        <br>Title: Revenue Management for Online Advertising: Pay-per-click Pricing</br><br>Author: Kristin Fridgeirsdottir, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, W1U 5HW, United Kingdom, kfridgeirsdottir@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sami Najafi-Asadolahi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a web publisher that generates revenues from displaying ads on its website. The web publisher charges the advertisers according to a pay-per-click pricing scheme. We compare this scheme to another common pricing scheme, pay-per-impression. We model the operation of the web publisher as a queuing system with no waiting spaces and derive a closed-form solution for its steady-state probabilities. We then determine the optimal pricing policy and provide managerial insights.</br>
