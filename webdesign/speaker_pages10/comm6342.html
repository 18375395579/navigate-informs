        <br>Title: Network Capacity Management Competition</br><br>Author: Houyuan Jiang, Professor, Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, h.jiang@jbs.cam.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider airline capacity management games where passengers can purchase same class tickets from competing airlines if they do not get tickets from their preferred airline. Four models are developed. We provide conditions for existence of a Nash or generalized Nash equilibrium for all four games and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium for two games. For generalized Nash games, we propose a numerical algorithm that combines penalty and smoothing techniques and establish a convergence result.</br>
