        <br>Title: Game-Theoretic Aspects of Designing Hyperlink Structures</br><br>Author: Nicole Immorlica, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052, United States, nickle@microsoft.com</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of designing the hyperlink structure of a website to maximize the revenue generated by a random walk on the website. We ask if each webpage is controlled by an autonomous agent, is it possible to give all coalitions incentive to cooperate and build the optimal hyperlink design? We show that the optimal design is in the core of the transferable utility game. For non-transferable utilities, we show the core is non-empty but can be highly inefficient.</br>
