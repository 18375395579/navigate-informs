        <br>Title: Blind Auctions and Predatory Trading</br><br>Author: Gerry Tsoukalas, University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America, gtsouk@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the blind auctions market in which a seller solicits private off-market bids for her portfolio. Fearing predation, the seller often runs the auction blind, in the sense that the underlying assets are only revealed ex-post to the winner. We study the secrecy vs. efficiency trade-off that ensues and characterize the optimal amount of information dissemination to the market. We show specific conditions under which transparency can be optimal, despite predatory behavior.</br>
