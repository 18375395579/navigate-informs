        <br>Title: Electricity Auctions: Discriminatory versus Uniform-Price</br><br>Author: Talat Genc, Asst. Professor, University of Guelph, Department of Economics, Guelph, On, Canada, tgenc@uoguelph.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We formulate a supply function equilibrium model in continuous offer schedules with time varying demand and with single/multiple step marginal cost function to compare two auction institutions in the presence of capacity constraints. We show that payments made to the suppliers in the unique equilibrium of the discriminatory auction can be less than the payments in the uniform-price auction. We also characterize mixed strategy supply function equilibrium under the discriminatory auction.</br>
