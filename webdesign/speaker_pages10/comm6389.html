        <br>Title: Revenue Optimization and the Generalized Second-price Auction</br><br>Author: David Thompson, PhD Student, University of British Columbia, 191-2366 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada, davidrthompson@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Search engines generate billions of dollars in advertising revenue using the generalized second-price auction (GSP).  They have tried to further increase revenue using GSP variants including different kinds of reserve prices, and quality-score squashing.  Our contributions are a comparison of different reserve price regimes (with and without squashing) and a study of how equilibrium selection affects the revenue generated by these variants.</br>
