        <br>Title: Repeat Procurement Auctions with Bidder Defection</br><br>Author: Christopher Held, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Management, 800 West Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, Christopher.Held@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Atalay Atasu, Mark Ferguson</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We explore the impact of entrant bidder defection on the outcome of repeat procurement auctions. We develop a model that includes bidding pool defection and analyze the characteristics of policies that perform well in the presence of defection. We simulate traditional policies and compare their performance in the presence of bidding pool defection to a policy developed specifically for defection. We show that when defection is present, existing policies perform poorly.</br>
