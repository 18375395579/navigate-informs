        <br>Title: Speculative Behavior in a Queue</br><br>Author: Andres Catalan-Cardenas, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, andresc@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Senthil Veeraraghavan, Gerard Cachon</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Not all the customers waiting for a service actually want the service: sometimes people queue solely to make a pro&#64257;t from customers. We analyze the behavior of a speculator in a single queue that sells his position to the arriving customers.  We find the price he will request and derive different thresholds in terms of queue length, system utilization and the speculator’s waiting costs that lead him to behave speculatively (i.e. to hold his position and wait) to maximize his pro&#64257;t.</br>
