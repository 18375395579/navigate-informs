Based on controlled lab experiments, this study evaluates how budget, risk attitude, and strategic thinking of consumers would affect their bidding strategies. We found evidences that penny auction is a profitable selling mechanism only under certain conditions. We further identify a number of factors that impact auctioneer revenue and bidders' performance in the auction.</br>
