        <br>Title: Options, Spot Prices, and Buyer Learning</br><br>Author: Jinpyo Lee, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology, jplee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anton J. Kleywegt</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A seller sells options, and later also sells on the spot at a price chosen by the seller.  The spot price may depend on the number of options sold, as well as some random demand data that was observed after the options were sold but before the spot price was determined.  In the first stage buyers decide how many options to buy, not knowing what the spot price will be, and not knowing the seller's spot pricing policy.  In the second stage buyers decide how many options to exercise and how much to buy on the spot.  Buyers use past observations of spot prices to estimate a spot price distribution. Spot prices depend on previous decisions, and thus the sequence of spot prices is neither independent nor identically distributed.  We study the convergence of decisions and distribution estimates, and compare the limits with the Nash equilibrium.</br>
