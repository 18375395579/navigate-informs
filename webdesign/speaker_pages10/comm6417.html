        <br>Title: Managing On-air Ad Inventory in Broadcast Television</br><br>Author: Suman Mallik, University of Kansas, 1300 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS, United States of America, mallik@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Srinivas Bollapragada</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a model for managing on-air ad inventory in broadcast television. The ad inventory in this industry is sold through two distinct processes: the Upfront, which occurs before the broadcast season, and the Scatter, which occurs during the broadcast season.  A firm needs to allocate its total ad inventory to these two markets before knowing either the performance of its shows or the Scatter market price. We present a model to optimally solve this problem and derive insights from it.</br>
