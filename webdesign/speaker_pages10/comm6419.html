        <br>Title: Airline Passengers?Cancellation Behavior</br><br>Author: Laurie Garrow, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Civil & Envr Engineering, 790 Atlantic Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0355, United States of America, laurie.garrow@ce.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Iliescu, Roger A Parker</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze airline passengers?exchange and refund behavior for multiple airlines using 2004 ticketing and void data.  Hazard models are used to predict if and when a ticket will be exchanged or refunded.  Empirical results indicate cancellations are most likely to occur right after they are purchased or right before the flight departs.  This points to two underlying behavioral phenomena: initial searching for flights, and rescheduling close to departure as travel plans become more certain.</br>
