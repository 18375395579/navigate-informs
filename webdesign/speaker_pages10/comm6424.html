        <br>Title: Online Bidding Agents and Walrasian Equilibrium Prices</br><br>Author: Bob Day, Assistant Professor, University of Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Road, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, bob.day@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rohit Aggarwal</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Minimal Walrasian equilibrium prices can be used to provide a benchmark for the study of markets consisting of online auctions for identical or nearly identical items. The derivation of these equilibrium prices suggests bidding strategies that can be implemented by automated agents, and we show conditions under which the use of these bidding agents forms a Nash equilibrium.</br>
