        <br>Title: Blind Nonparametric Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Omar Besbes, PhD Student, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, ob2105@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Assaf Zeevi</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a general class of network revenue management problems where the decision maker is ‘‘blind’’ to the underlying demand function. We develop nonparametric pricing algorithms that learn this function ``on the fly,’’ and prove that, in  a regime where the sales volume grows large,  these algorithms achieve the optimal revenues generated by pricing policies that ``know’’ the demand function a priori.</br>
