        <br>Title: Traffic Arrivals Into Retail Stores - Distributional Assumptions and Why They Matter?</br><br>Author: Vidya Mani, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, United States of America, vmani@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jayashankar M. Swaminathan, Saravanan Kesavan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the distribution of customer arrivals to retail stores in a large retail chain. Most analytical work on customer arrivals assumes a Poisson distribution for planning purposes as it is analytically tractable. Using hourly traffic data from a major retailer, we identify the underlying distribution of incoming traffic and explore the implications of using an incorrect arrival distribution by studying its impact on store labor planning and profitability.</br>
