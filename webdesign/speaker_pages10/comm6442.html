        <br>Title: Supplier Competition When Service Matters</br><br>Author: Karen Donohue, Associate Professor, The Carlson School, University of Minnesota, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, kdonohue@csom.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elena Katok, Saif Benjaafar</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: How should a buyer outsource demand across competing suppliers to optimize the level of service he receives?  We analyze this problem from an analytical perspective and then test the resulting theory using a series of laboratory experiments.  We find that human subjects are more aggressive in their service investments, and more sensitive to the type of competition offered, than theory would suggest.</br>
