        <br>Title: Conditional Promotions and Consumer Overspending</br><br>Author: Thunyarat (Bam) Amornpetchkul, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan St., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, thunyara@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hyun-Soo Ahn, Ozge Sahin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Conditional promotions (e.g. spend $50 get 30% off, spend $50 get $15 off) are widely used in retail pricing. They are especially effective when some consumers are deal-prone (obtain transaction utility from purchasing at a discount). We compare two most common discount policies: percent-off and dollar-off, and show that both policies can lead to consumer overspending. We also show, depending on the nature of the product, one discount policy can perform better than the other.</br>
