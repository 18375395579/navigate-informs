        <br>Title: Truthful Auctions for Pricing Search Keywords</br><br>Author: Gagan Aggarwal, Stanford University, Computer Science Department, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, gagan@cs.stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rajat Bhattacharjee, Rajeev Motwani</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a truthful auction for pricing advertising slots on a webpage. The auction ranks the advertisers in decreasing order of their (weighted) bids. By setting the weights appropriately, it captures both the Overture model (advertisers ranked in order of bids) and the Google model (advertisers ranked in order of expected revenue generated). Assuming separable click-through rates, we prove revenue-equivalence between our auction and the non-truthful next-price auctions currently in use.</br>
