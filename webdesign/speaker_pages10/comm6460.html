        <br>Title: Dynamic Pivotal Mechanism</br><br>Author: Dirk Bergemann, dirk.bergemann@yale.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Juuso Valimaki</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider truthful implementation of the socially efficient allocation in a dynamic private value environment in which agents receive private information over time. We propose a generalization of the pivotal mechanism, based on the marginal contribution of each agent. In the dynamic pivotal mechanism, the ex post incentive and ex post participations constraints are satisfied for all agents after all histories.</br>
