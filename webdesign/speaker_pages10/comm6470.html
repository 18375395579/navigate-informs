        <br>Title: Optimal Allocation of Exclusivity Contracts</br><br>Author: Sasa Pekec, Duke University, The Fuqua School of Business, 100 Fuqua Drive, Box 90120, Durham, NC, 27708-0120, United States of America, pekec@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Changrong Deng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study optimal allocation and pricing of contracts on a network of competing buyers. Buyers have private values for getting the contract and also for getting it exclusively. The monopolist seller limited to offering posted prices should inflate the contract price to capture part of the premium buyers put on exclusivity. Posted prices are not optimal, so we use mechanism design to describe revenue-maximizing procedures and corresponding optimal auctions for exclusivity valuations of interest.</br>
