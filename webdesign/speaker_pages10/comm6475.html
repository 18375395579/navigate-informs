        <br>Title: Relative Performance Auctions</br><br>Author: Octavian Carare, Assistant Professor, UT Dallas, 2604 N Floyd Rd, SM 3.1, Richardson, TX, United States of America, carare@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vladimir Mares</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the behavior of bidders in auctions where the relative performance of bidders matters. We consider several bidding environments involving sequential and simultaneous auction procedures in which the bidders' payoffs are affected by the relative ranking of their auction winnings. Conditioning payoffs on relative performance is generally detrimental to efficiency.</br>
