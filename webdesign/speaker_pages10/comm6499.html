The free agents comprise the items and the team’s cap space corresponds to the size of the knapsack. As free agents are signed, both the talent pool to fill the team’s needs and the money in the market decreases. Thus, the optimal free agency strategy must considers the trade-off of losing a player to a competitor and acquiring the player at a price that preserves as much cap space as possible to sign additional players.</br>
