        <br>Title: The Groupon Effect on Yelp Ratings: A Root Cause Analysis</br><br>Author: Giorgos Zervas, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States of America, zg@cs.yale.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Mitzenmacher, John Byers</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Daily deals sites such as Groupon offer deeply discounted goods and services to millions of customers through geographically targeted daily email marketing campaigns.

In this work, we rigorously consider and evaluate various hypotheses about underlying consumer and merchant behavior in order to understand this phenomenon, which we dub the Groupon effect.</br>
