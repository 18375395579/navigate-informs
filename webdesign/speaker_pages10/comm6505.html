        <br>Title: A Brownian Model of Dynamic Pricing with Demand Model Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Bora Keskin, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America, bora.keskin@chicagobooth.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a Brownian formulation to address the tradeoff between learning and earning in a dynamic pricing problem with demand model uncertainty. Using stochastic control theory, we solve for the optimal policy of the Brownian model. We discuss how this optimal policy can be employed to design dynamic pricing policies in discrete time formulations, and demonstrate the performance of such policies via simulation.</br>
