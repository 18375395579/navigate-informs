        <br>Title: On the Correlation between Waiting Times and Service Speed</br><br>Author: Pnina Feldman, Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, 545 Student Services Bldg #1900, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States of America, feldman@haas.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jing Dong, Galit Yom-Tov</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The service operations literature typically assumes that firms control service times and that those are independent of the time customers spend waiting. Empirical evidence suggests otherwise. In fact, the time consumers spend in line affects their expectations on service length. Some consumers require longer service after waiting a long time and others expect a rushed service. We examine how such correlations affect the firm's operational performance.</br>
