Three pricing policies, discriminatory, uniform and mill pricing are considered. We establish nodal optimality of the location decision and find optimal locations and prices under mild conditions. We provide managerial insights regarding when a firm should use discriminatory pricing versus mill or uniform pricing.</br>
