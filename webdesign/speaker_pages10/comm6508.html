        <br>Title: A Model of Consumer Inertia with Applications to Dynamic Pricing</br><br>Author: Xuanming Su, University of California, Haas School of Business, Berkeley, 94720, United States, xuanming@haas.berkeley.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Consumers often wait until the last minute before making a purchase. This indicates strategic behavior if they can secure a last-minute discount. Yet, consumers sometimes wait even when doing so is suboptimal (e.g., there may be higher prices or lower availability later). We show that such behavior is consistent with several well-established behavioral regularities and study its implications on dynamic pricing strategies.</br>
