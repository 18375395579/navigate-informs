        <br>Title: Information Heterogeneity and the Speed of Learning in Social Networks</br><br>Author: Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, 418 Uris Hall, New York, NY, 10023, United States of America, alirezat@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ali Jadbabaie, Pooya Molavi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper examines how the structure of a social network and the quality of information available to different agents determine the speed of social learning. We show that the rate of learning has a simple analytical characterization in terms of the relative entropy of agents?signal structures and their eigenvector centralities. Our characterization establishes that the way information is dispersed throughout the social network has non-trivial implications for the rate of learning.</br>
