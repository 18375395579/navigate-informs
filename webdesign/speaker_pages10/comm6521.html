        <br>Title: Decision-making in Social Networks</br><br>Author: Ilan Lobel, 77 Massachusetts avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, lobel@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daron Acemoglu, Munther Dahleh, Asu Ozdaglar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the equilibrium of a model of learning and decision-making over a social network. Each individual receives some signal about an underlying state, observes the actions of a neighborhood of individuals, and chooses an action. We characterize conditions that allow efficient aggregation of information. We show that information with unbounded likelihood almost always propagates efficiently, while bounded likelihood demands specific network topologies for information aggregation.</br>
