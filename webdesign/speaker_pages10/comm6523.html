        <br>Title: Revenue Management by Semi-parametric Estimation of Ticket Sales</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Necati Tereyagoglu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a semi-parametric competing proportional hazard framework that models the dynamic effects of an organization's show and time related pricing decisions on the customer's propensity to purchase a ticket for a variety of shows during a specified timeframe. We test our model on ticket sales and seat pricing data for a season of 21 concerts from a leading performing arts organization. We suggest a discounting policy using these estimates.</br>
