        <br>Title: Dynamic Pricing for Hotels Considering Multiple-Day Stays</br><br>Author: Yun Fong Lim, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, 50 Stamford Rd, #04-01, Singapore, 178899, Singapore, yflim@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Qing Ding, Kum-Khiong Yang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the pricing policy that maximizes the expected revenue for hotels with stochastic and nonstationary arrivals of requests for a single room type. We consider the capacity requirement of multiple-day stays if customers make such reservations. We formulate this problem as a stochastic dynamic program. Our results suggest that we should substantially raise the rental rates for high-demand days and simultaneously lower the rental rates for their neighboring, low-demand days.</br>
