        <br>Title: An Experimental Study of Posted Prices</br><br>Author: Seungbeom Kim, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, Data Sciences and Operations, Los angeles, CA, 90089-0809, United States of America, seungbek@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sriram Dasu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We use laboratory experiments to gain insights into how customers make purchase decisions when they have the option of buying at a higher price or waiting for a lower price but incur the risk of the product being out of stock. Our data does not support the rational utility maximization models commonly assumed in theoretical papers. Moreover, buyer decisions demonstrate bounded rationality. We discuss the implications that our findings hold for pricing strategies.</br>
