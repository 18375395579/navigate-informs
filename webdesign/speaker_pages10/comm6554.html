        <br>Title: Dynamic Capacity Allocation and Pricing under Competition</br><br>Author: Houyuan Jiang, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, h.jiang@jbs.cam.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mikhail Nediak, Yuri Levin</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Firms with fixed capacities compete for customers by repeating the same services. For a monopolist, we prove that a fixed price policy is asymptotically optimal to a dynamic price policy and study monotone properties of prices. We show that the strategy profile based on the fixed price policy in a competitive environment is an epsilon-Nash equilibrium of the dynamic pricing game. We study comparative statics results for both monopolistic and oligopolistic pricing problems.</br>
