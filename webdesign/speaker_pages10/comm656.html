        <br>Title: Optimal Procurement Auctions under Product Differentiation</br><br>Author: Vladimir Mares, Washington University, Olin School of Business, St. Louis, MO, United States, mares@wustl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeroen Swinkels</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The paper derives the optimal procurement mechanism in the presence of heterogeneous preferences over alternative goods. Implementation can be achieved with simple auction mechanisms subject to properly choosing bidding credits. The paper also analyzes variants of the request for bid mechanisms, looking at sleeve auctions which combine comptetitive price allocation with the unfettered product choice by the buyer.</br>
