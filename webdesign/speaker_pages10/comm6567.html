        <br>Title: Capacity-dependent Bid Prices in Network Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Cornell University, Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States, ht88@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sumit Kunnumkal</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new method to compute bid prices. The novel aspect of our method is that it explicitly considers the temporal dynamics of the itinerary arrivals and generates bid prices that depend on the remaining leg capacities. Our method is based on relaxing certain constraints that link the decisions for different flight legs by associating Lagrange multipliers with them. This decomposes the network revenue management problem by the flight legs and we concentrate on one flight leg at a time.</br>
