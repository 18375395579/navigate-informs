        <br>Title: Prediction Markets in Theory and Practice</br><br>Author: Justin Wolfers, Assistant Professor of Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School, Steinberg-Dietrich Hall, Suite 1400, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA, 19106, United States, jwolfers@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eric Zitzewitz</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Prediction Markets allow participants to trade contracts with payoffs tied to future events, thereby yielding prices that can be interpreted as market-aggregated forecasts. We highlight recent theoretical contributions that emphasize the possibility that these markets efficiently aggregate disperse information, and the lessons from empirical applications which show that market-generated forecasts typically outperform most moderately sophisticated benchmarks.</br>
