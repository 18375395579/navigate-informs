        <br>Title: Dynamic Pricing of New Experience Goods</br><br>Author: Dirk Bergemann, Campbell Professor of Economics, Department of Economics, Yale University, 28 Hillhouse Avenue, New Haven, CT, 06511, United States, dirk.bergemann@yale.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Juuso Valimaki</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a dynamic model of experience goods pricing with independent private valuations. We show that the optimal paths of sales and prices can be described in terms of a simple dichotomy. In a mass market, prices are declining over time. In a niche market, the optimal prices are initially low followed by higher prices that extract surplus from the buyers with a high willingness to pay.</br>
