        <br>Title: Simple Models of Discrete Choice and Their Performance in Bandit Experiments</br><br>Author: George Knox, Doctoral Candidate, Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street, 700 JMHH, Philadelphia, PA, 19103, United States, gknox@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rachel Croson, Noah Gans</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Recent operations management papers model customers as solving multi-armed bandit problems, positing that consumers use a particular heuristic when choosing among suppliers. These papers then analyze the resulting competition among suppliers and mathematically characterize the equilibrium actions. In this paper, we empirically investigate how well these choice rules match actual performance as people solve two-armed Bernoulli bandit problems.</br>
