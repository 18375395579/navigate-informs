        <br>Title: Payment Rules through Discriminant-based Classifers</br><br>Author: Ben Lubin, Professor, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States of America, blubin@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Felix Fischer, Pichayut Jirapinyo, John Lai, David Parkes, Paul Deutting</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In mechanism design one typically seeks socially optimal mechanisms constrained by incentive compatibility. By replacing this constraint with the goal of minimizing expected ex post regret, we are able to adapt statistical machine learning techniques to the design of payment rules in settings with multi-dimensional types. Specifically, we train a support vector machine with a special discriminant function, such that it implicitly establishes a payment rule with desirable properties.</br>
