        <br>Title: Omni-channel Price Optimization</br><br>Author: Pavithra Harsha, IBM Research, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Room 34-225, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, pharsha@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shivaram Subramanian, Markus Ettl, Charles Ng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The face of retail is changing with consumers increasingly navigating through multiple channels to make purchases. Currently, retailers operate the different channels in silos. In our work, using real data from a retailer, we show the existence of cross channel price effects for several items in different categories.  Our main contributions include the framework and an efficient and scalable method to perform an integrated omni-channel price optimization solution with a computational study.</br>
