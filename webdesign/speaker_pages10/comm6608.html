        <br>Title: Optimal Mechanisms for Selling Information</br><br>Author: Renato Paes Leme, Cornell University, 4139 Upson Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, renatoppl@cs.cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Kleinberg, Moshe Babaioff</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we study the design of optimal mechanisms for a monopolistic data provider to sell information to a buyer, in a model where both parties have (possibly correlated) private signals about a state of the world, and the buyer uses information learned from the seller, along with his own signal, to choose an action (e.g., displaying an ad) whose payoff depends on the state of the world.</br>
