        <br>Title: Pricing A Service with Observable but Noncontractible Quality for Heterogeneous  Customers</br><br>Author: Raj Rajagopalan, Srajagop@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guangwen Kong, Hao Zhang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider optimal pricing of a service to two types of consumers with different (private) valuations for service quality. The realized quality is observable but non-contractible and it depends on the service provider's private effort deterministically or stochastically. We consider a variety of pricing schemes and identify scenarios where the service provider may serve only one type of consumer, serve both types with the same quality level, or serve both types with different quality levels.</br>
