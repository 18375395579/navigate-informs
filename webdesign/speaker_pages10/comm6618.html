        <br>Title: Characterizing Optimal Keyword Auctions</br><br>Author: Anuj Kumar, Industrial Engineering & Operations Research Department, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States, ak2108@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Garud Iyengar</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a variety of models for keyword auctions used for pricing advertising slots on the search engines (Google Inc., Yahoo! Inc. etc.). First, we present a compact characterization of the set of all deterministic incentive compatible direct mechanisms in a model with slot dependent valuations. Next, we study two interesting cases of this model: slot independent valuation and constant valuations up to a privately known slot and zero thereafter.</br>
