        <br>Title: Buy-it-now or Take-a-chance: A Mechanism for Real-time Price Discrimination</br><br>Author: Hamid Nazerzadeh, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America, hamidnz@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elisa Celis, Greg Lewis, Markus Mobius</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Increasingly sophisticated consumer tracking technology allows advertisers to reach narrowly targeted consumer demographics. Such targeting improves the match quality between advertisers and users, but can also result in thin markets. Using historical bidding data from a large advertising exchange, we show that there is often a substantial gap between the highest and second highest willingness to pay. With this motivation, I present a simple sequential screening mechanism.</br>
