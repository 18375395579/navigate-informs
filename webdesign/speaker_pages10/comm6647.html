        <br>Title: Investment and Market Structure in Industries with Congestion</br><br>Author: Gabriel Y. Weintraub, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering Department, Terman Engineering Center, 3rd Floor, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, gweintra@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ramesh Johari, Benjamin Van Roy</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We analyze investment and market structure in service industries with congestion effects. Firms compete by choosing prices and investments that mitigate congestion. We develop game theoretic models to analyze whether competition between profit-maximizing firms leads to efficient outcomes in different scenarios. Our model and results provide a framework through which a range of service industries can be studied, offering guidance for policy analysis.</br>
