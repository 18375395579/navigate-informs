        <br>Title: Optimal Product-line Design Using Bundling and Pricing</br><br>Author: Chi-Guhn Lee, cglee@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this research we study a problem of optimizing a product-line with an objective to maximize the total revenue. Logit model is used to define the discrete choice probability, from which the expected revenue generated from a product-line is derived. Case studies have been performed based on consumer survey done among college students.</br>
