        <br>Title: Inventory Ordering Consolidation: The Sensitivity of the Core</br><br>Author: Moshe Dror, Professor, University of Arizona, MIS, Eller College of Management, Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States, mdror@eller.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Cheng, Bruce C. Hartman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In a multi-item EOQ environment with two-part ordering cost composed of a constant shared cost and an item specific cost, inventory ordering consolidation cost has to be distributed among its items. It can be described as a cooperative game problem. In this talk we discuss the core of this game (a set of cost allocations that are fair) and its sensitivity to different problem parameters. The relation of concavity and inseparability of the game is examined computationally as well as other parameter properties.</br>
