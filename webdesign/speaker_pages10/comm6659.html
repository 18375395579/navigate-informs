        <br>Title: Stuctural Properties of Supply Chain Contracts under Bounded Rationality</br><br>Author: Valery Pavlov, v.pavlov@auckland.ac.nz</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tava Olsen, Elena Katok, Ernan Haruvy</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recent empirical studies on the performance of coordinating contracts made it clear that the standard theory makes strong predictions that are not always fulfilled. Our study aims to characterize structural properties of such popular mechanisms as wholesale pricing, two-part tariffs, and the minimum order quantity contract using the framework of quantal response equilbirium for boundedly rational players.</br>
