        <br>Title: Dynamic Pricing with Uncertainty in Market Response</br><br>Author: Vivek Farias, Stanford University, vivekf@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Benjamin Van Roy</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a single resource revenue management model with uncertainty in demand statistics. We present a simple heuristic that addresses the tradeoff between `exploratory' pricing that attempts to learn quickly and pricing that attempts to hedge against the possibility of a highly popular product. In addition to promising computational results we present a uniform performance guarantee.</br>
