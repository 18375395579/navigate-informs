        <br>Title: Dynamic Cost-Per-Action Mechanisms and Applications to Online Advertising</br><br>Author: Amin Saberi, Stanford University, Terman Engineering Building, Room 317, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, saberi@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hamid Nazerzadeh, Rakesh Vohra</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the Cost-Per-Action or Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) charging scheme in online advertising. In this scheme, instead of paying per click, the advertisers pay only when a user takes a specific action(e.g. fills out a form) or completes a transaction on their websites. We focus on designing efficient and incentive compatible mechanisms that use this charging scheme.</br>
