        <br>Title: Optimal VCG Redistribution Mechanisms</br><br>Author: Vincent Conitzer, Assistant Professor, Duke University, LSRC, Box 90129, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, conitzer@cs.duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mingyu Guo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: It is impossible for an auction mechanism to simultaneously satisfy  efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and (strong) budget  balance.  Nevertheless, it is possible to satisfy the first three and come  close to budget balance, using redistribution mechanisms.  I will cover  worst-case optimal, undominated, and optimal-in-expectation redistribution  mechanisms.</br>
