        <br>Title: Trunk Reservation Revisited: On Price-Driven Storage Allocation in a Peer-to-Peer Network Federation</br><br>Author: Peter Reichl, Key Researcher, Telecommunications Research Center Vienna (ftw.), Donaucitystrasse 1, Vienna, A-1220, Austria, reichl@ftw.at</br><br>Coauthor(s): Barbara Emmert, Sandford Bessler</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper deals with federations of peer-to-peer networks and proposes a price-driven mechanism for matching available free storage capacity with respective demands. The scheme is based on “trunk reservation?as an optimal capacity allocation strategy for loss networks with two different classes of requests. We compare this approach with two other simple allocation schemes and demonstrate to which extent it is able to provide incentives for the individual domains to cooperate with each other.</br>
