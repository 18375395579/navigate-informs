        <br>Title: Non-Cooperative Resource Sharing by Internet Service Providers</br><br>Author: Gireesh Shrimali, Assistant Professor, Indian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, AP, 500032, India, Gireesh_Shrimali@isb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sunil Kumar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study resource sharing by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in a two ISP model. In absence of customer competition, we show not only that participation in sharing is guaranteed but also that one of the ISPs acts as a resource supplier since it has no incentive to use the other resource. In presence of customer competition, we show that, though participation is not guaranteed, intuitive sufficient conditions for the same may be derived under the special case of quadratic costs.</br>
