        <br>Title: Luxury Yacht Rentals ?How to Forecast Demand and Optimize Prices?</br><br>Author: Pelin Pekgun, Assistant Professor, University of South Carolina, Moore School of Business, 1705 College Street, Columbia, SC, 29208, United States of America, Pelin.Pekgun@moore.sc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ronald Menich</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Luxury yacht rentals is a niche market with a unique business model that presents rich revenue opportunities but also makes it vulnerable in a challenging economy.

We present a forecasting and optimization framework that can address the unique challenges in this environment.</br>
