        <br>Title: Maximizing Employer’s Utility in Online Labor Markets</br><br>Author: Marios Kokkodis, PhD Student, New York University, Stern School of Business, New York, NY, United States of America, mkokkodi@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panagiotis Ipeirotis, Panagiotis Papadimitriou, Yiannis Antonellis</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this work we study the matching problem in online labor markets (OLMs) by concentrating on the employer's side; we assume that employers make rational decisions and that they are utility maximizers. Under reasonable assumptions, we define the employer's utility as a function of the probability of hiring a particular worker and the inferred quality of the worker. We build and evaluate our models on real transactional data from one of the leadings OLMs, oDesk.com.</br>
