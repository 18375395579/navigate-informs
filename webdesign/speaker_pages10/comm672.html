        <br>Title: Competitive Dynamic Pricing with Guarantees in the Presence of Strategic Consumers</br><br>Author: Yuri Levin, Queen's School of Business, 143 Union Street, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada, YLevin@business.queensu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yossi Aviv, Mikhail Nediak</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a two-period model of duopolistic capacitated dynamic pricing competition when each firm's strategy can include price matching, and consumer response is strategic. The products offered by the firms are differentiated, and consumer choice is described using a random utility model that takes expected product availability into account. We study the properties of equilibrium strategies, and whether price matching can be an effective tool in countering strategic consumer behavior.</br>
