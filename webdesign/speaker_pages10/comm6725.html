        <br>Title: Analyzing Bidding Dynamics in Reverse Auctions: Process Metrics and a Functional Approach</br><br>Author: Otto Koppius, Assistant Professor of Decision and Information Sciences, Rotterdam School of Management, 50 Burg Oudlaan, Rotterdam, Netherlands, okoppius@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wolfgang Jank, Galit Shmueli, Sunil Mithas, Joni Jones</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The bidding dynamics during an auction play an important role in explaining auction outcome, yet remain underinvestigated due to a lack of common process metrics and analytical methods. We propose several such metrics that enable a comparison of bidding dynamics across auctions. We also show that techniques from Functional Data Analysis (FDA) yield additional insights into bidding dynamics. We illustrate our arguments with an analysis of 700+ reverse auctions in the automotive industry.</br>
