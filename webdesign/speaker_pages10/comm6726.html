        <br>Title: A Direct Test of Risk Aversion in First Price Sealed Bid Auctions</br><br>Author: Elena Katok, Associate Professor, Penn State University, 465 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, ekatok@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Engelbrecht-Wiggans</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present theory and experiments designed to provide a direct test of risk aversion as the explanation of “overbidding?relative to the risk-neutral Nash equilibrium in sealed-bid first price (SBFP) auctions.  We conclude that risk aversion fails the test—it cannot, by itself, explain overbidding in SBFP auctions.</br>
