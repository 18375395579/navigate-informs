        <br>Title: Decomposition Approaches for Planning Targeted Online Ad Campaigns</br><br>Author: John Turner, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, jgt@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Scheller-Wolf, Sridhar Tayur</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Ad campaigns may be targeted toward certain demographic groups or geographic areas.  Linear programming may be used to decide what rate to serve each campaign in each inventory type; however, 1) as targeting becomes sophisticated the number of inventory types grows combinatorially; and 2) the number of impressions of each inventory type is unknown ex-ante.  We explore some decomposition techniques and provide experimental results applied to the scheduling of ads in online video games.</br>
