        <br>Title: Stability and Endogenous Formation of Inventory Transshipment Networks</br><br>Author: Xin Fang, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, xfang@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Soo-Haeng Cho</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies a cooperative game of inventory transshipment among multiple firms. In this game, firms first make their inventory decisions independently under uncertain demands, and then decide collectively how to transship excess inventories to satisfy unmet demands. Instead of coalitions that are used in all previous studies, we use networks of firms as the primitive, which offer a richer representation of relationships among firms by taking coalitions as special cases.</br>
