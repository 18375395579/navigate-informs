        <br>Title: Intertemporal Price Discrimination with Forward-Looking Consumers: The Market for Video-Games</br><br>Author: Harikesh Nair, Assistant Professor of Marketing, Stanford University, 518 Memorial Way, Graduate School of Business, Stanford, CA, 94035, United States, Nair_Harikesh@gsb.stanford.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a framework to investigate empirically intertemporal price discrimination policies by firms selling durable-good products. Prices in the model are equilibrium outcomes of a game played between strategic forward-looking consumers and firms. We present methods to infer estimates of demand under such dynamic consumer behavior, and to compute optimal prices. An empirical application to the market for video-games is presented.</br>
