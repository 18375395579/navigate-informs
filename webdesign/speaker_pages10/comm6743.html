        <br>Title: Practical Procurement?Beyond Reverse and Combinatorial Auctions</br><br>Author: Olga Raskina, Lead Scientist, Emptoris, 200 Wheeler Road, Burlington, MA, 02476, United States of America, ORaskina@emptoris.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider some of the challenges in implementing multiple item procurement auctions in a business environment. We will discuss our experience with handling more advanced auction requirements we have observed in the field. Many of them go beyond familiar theoretical auction setup, but need to be addressed to align the auction with the actual business needs.
