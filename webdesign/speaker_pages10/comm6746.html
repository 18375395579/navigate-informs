        <br>Title: What's on the Table: Revenue Management and the Welfare Gap in the US Airline Industry</br><br>Author: Vivek Farias, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, vivekf@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yiwei Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a status quo estimate of total welfare in the US airline industry along with what we believe is the first operationally relevant benchmark for optimal welfare. Our estimates leverage a unique data set on ticket purchases. We show that the welfare gap is surprisingly large, raising the possibility that, moving forward, a combination of innovative selling mechanisms and legislation can make a dramatic difference to airline profitability and consumer satisfaction alike.</br>
