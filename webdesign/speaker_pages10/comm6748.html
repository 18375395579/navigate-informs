        <br>Title: Heterogeneous Congestion Control Protocols</br><br>Author: A. Kevin Tang, Caltech, MC 256-80, Pasadena, CA, 91125, United States, aotang@caltech.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Homogeneity of price is an implicit yet fundamental assumption underlying price based resource allocation theory.  In this thesis, we study effects of relaxing this assumption by examining networks with heterogeneous congestion control. A systematic theory is developed that includes all major properties of equilibrium such as existence, uniqueness, optimality and stability.  Furthermore, a practical distributed algorithm is proposed to steer a network to the unique optimal operating point. Various experiments are provided to illustrate the theory and verify its predictions.</br>
