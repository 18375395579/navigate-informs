        <br>Title: Combinatorial Betting</br><br>Author: David Pennock, Yahoo!, 111 West 40th Street, 17th floor, New York, NY, 10018, United States of America, pennockd@yahoo-inc.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: I will survey our attempts to design combinatorial betting mechanisms that support doubly exponentially many allowable bets and propagate information appropriately across logically-related bets. The greater expressiveness comes at a computational cost for the auctioneer, who faces a difficult matching problem. In general, full expressiveness renders the matching problem intractable, though some reasonable restrictions on expressiveness admit polynomial-time matching.</br>
