        <br>Title: Optimal Selling Scheme in Social Networks: Hierarchical Signaling, Sequential Selling, and Chain Structure</br><br>Author: Ying-Ju Chen, University of California-Berkeley, Department of Industrial Engineering, Berkeley, CA, United States of America, chen@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Junjie Zhou</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies the optimal selling scheme when a seller intends to sell a product/service with unknown quality to consumers with heterogeneous knowledge. The model setup features the positive externality, the seller's price discrimination power, and the information transmissions. We identify the consumers' intrinsic signaling incentives and the positive feedback effects, and prove the optimality of chain structure. The revenue-maximizing pricing exhibits the cream skimming property.</br>
