        <br>Title: Sponsored Search vs. Search Engine Optimization:  Competitive Strategies for Internet Retailers</br><br>Author: Ram Bala, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA, United States of America, rbala@scu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Amit Mehra, Jagmohan Raju</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We formulate a game-theoretic model of competition between a small Internet retailer and a branded retailer such as Amazon, where customer traffic is directed to the retailers through organic or sponsored links at search engines.

We uncover several insights regarding the mix of investments in these two options.</br>
