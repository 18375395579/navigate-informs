        <br>Title: A Model of Search Intermediaries and Paid Referrals</br><br>Author: Thomas Weber, Assistant Professor, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, Terman Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305-4026, United States, webert@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhiqiang (Eric) Zheng</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a simple two-stage model of a search intermediary in a vertically differentiated product market. After the intermediary chooses a ranking function, competing firms place their bids for each referral by the search engine. The revenue-maximizing search-engine design bases rankings on a weighted average of product performance and bid amount; the intermediary has an interest to obfuscate search results and thus reduce consumer surplus compared to a socially optimal design.</br>
