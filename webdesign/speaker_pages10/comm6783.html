        <br>Title: Dynamic Matching in Overloaded Systems</br><br>Author: Jacob Leshno, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, yarboz@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a model in which impatient agents with heterogeneous preferences wait for heterogeneous items. Social welfare is maximized by appropriately matching agents to items. We analyze and develop dynamic queue based assignment mechanisms which allocate items efficiently by incentivizing agents to wait for appropriate items.</br>
