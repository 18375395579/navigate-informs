        <br>Title: The Cost  of  Free Spectrum</br><br>Author: Thanh Nguyen, Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL, United States of America, t-nguyen@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The FCC has recently increased the amount of spectrum available for wireless services by permitting unlicensed access to television whitespaces. While this additional unlicensed spectrum allows for market expansion, it also influences competition among providers and increase congestion among consumers of wireless services.  We find that the social and consumer welfare depends on the amount of additional unlicensed spectrum, can actually decrease over a significant range of unlicensed bandwidths.</br>
