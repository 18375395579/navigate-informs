        <br>Title: Cost Comparison between Infrastructure Cloud Services</br><br>Author: Huan Liu, Accenture Technology Labs, 50 W San Fernando St., San Jose, CA, 95113, United States of America, huan.liu@accenture.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Infrastructure cloud service providers, such as Amazon EC2, differ  widely from each other in terms of their price structure, which makes  it very difficult to perform an apple-to-apple comparison. In this  paper, we describe a methodology to dissect the price structure into  its individual components, including CPU, memory, and hard disk  capacity. We then use the price components to compare offerings from a  few dominate cloud providers.</br>
