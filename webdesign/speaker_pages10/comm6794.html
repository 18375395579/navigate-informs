        <br>Title: Information and the Value of Execution Guarantees</br><br>Author: Krishnamurthy Iyer, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, kriyer@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ramesh Johari, Ciamac Moallemi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We assess the role of information in the choice between certain trade at a price premium in an intermediated dealer market and contingent trade in a dark pool. Our setting consists of traders with heterogeneous private information as to an asset's value, who endogenously decide between these two venues. We analyze how this choice depends on the information available to an individual trader, as well as the overall distribution of information across all traders and the premium for certain trade.</br>
