        <br>Title: Dynamic Pricing of Seasonal Products in the Presence of Forward-Looking Consumers</br><br>Author: Yossi Aviv, Associate Professor of Operations Management, Olin School of Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1133, 1 Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO, 63141, United States, aviv@wustl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Amit Pazgal</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing of seasonal goods in the presence of strategic customers. Under limited inventory, consumers need to consider not only future prices, but the likelihood of stockouts, which depends on other customers' behavior. We analyze the structure of optimal purchasing strategies, and the way in which strategic consumer behavior impacts pricing policies and expected revenue performance for the seller.</br>
