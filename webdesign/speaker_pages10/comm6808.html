        <br>Title: Hard Block Code-Sharing Contracts for Airline Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Guillermo Gallego, Professor, Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States, gmg2@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Youyi Feng</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider capacity contracts between a marketing and operating airline where a fixed block of seats is leased at a fixed price per seat. We characterize optimal booking limits for both airlines and use the expected revenue function to determine optimal demand and supply curves for seats at a function of price. This enables the design of win-win operational contracts that do not give up control of individual airline networks.</br>
