        <br>Title: Some Experimental Studies of Dynamic Pricing</br><br>Author: Neil Bearden, INSEAD, Decision Sciences Area, Singapore, jneilb@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bill Becker, Amnon Rapoport</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present results from three experimental studies of dynamic pricing of perishable goods in the face of constant, increasing, and decreasing demand. Our results show that actual decision makers systematically mis-price their goods; that their pricing errors are systematically related to how demand changes with time; and that they incur significant revenue losses. We argue that laboratory studies can help demonstrate that decision makers would benefit a great deal from optimal pricing models.</br>
