        <br>Title: Estimating Flight-Level Price Elasticities using Online Airline Data</br><br>Author: Laurie Garrow, Georgia Institute of Technology, 790 Atlantic Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, laurie.garrow@ce.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stacey Mumbower, Matthew Higgins</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We estimate flight-level price elasticities using a database of online prices and seat map displays. We use an approach that corrected for price endogeneity; failure to do so resulted in incorrect pricing recommendations. We use an instrumented variable approach (two-stage least squares regression) to address this problem, and find a set of valid instruments that can be used in future studies of air travel demand.  We use elasticity results to show how airlines can design better promotions and strategically match a subset of their competitors?sale fares.</br>
