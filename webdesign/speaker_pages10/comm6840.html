        <br>Title: Product Assortment under Choice Behavior</br><br>Author: Juan Jose Miranda Bront, University of Buenos Aires, Pabellón I - Ciudad Universitaria, Capital Federal, BA, C1428EGA, Argentina, jmiranda@dc.uba.ar</br><br>Coauthor(s): Isabel Méndez-Díaz, Gustavo Vulcano, Paula Zabala</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a revenue management problem with fixed prices and a general model of market segmentation. Consumers within each segment choose according to a multinomial logit model. The seller has to decide the optimal set of products to offer in order to maximize the instantaneous revenue rate. We formulate the problem as a MIP, and develop a branch-and-cut to solve it effectively. Our numerical experiments provide evidence of the potential of our approach.</br>
