        <br>Title: Customer Segmentation for Customized Pricing</br><br>Author: Tudor Bodea, InterContinental Hotels Group, Three Ravinia Drive, Atlanta, GA, 30346, United States of America, tudor_bodea@hotmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Ferguson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We show that the segmentation techniques routinely used for customized pricing often violate the requirements of the normative segmentation theory. To overcome this problem, we introduce a model-based recursive partitioning algorithm that provides a sound theoretical framework for segmenting markets based on demand functions representative of customers' response to a firm's offering. Our work supports the use of the ideal bases for normative segmentation in customized pricing applications.</br>
