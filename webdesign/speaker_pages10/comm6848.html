        <br>Title: Truthful Ad Throttling</br><br>Author: De Liu, University of Kentucky, 425D Gatton B&E Building, Lexington, KY, 40506, United States of America, de.liu@uky.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In ad auction prices, ad buyers are usually permitted to participate in a percentage of all auctions they are eligible for so that their spend may not exceed their budget. This practice, known as throttling, are often optimized without considering its impact on budget setting. We propose a throttle mechanism that is both truthful and efficient provided that ad buyer preferences can be modeled by a utility function. This mechanism combines a throttling schedule and a VCG-based ad auction.</br>
