        <br>Title: Computing Bid-prices in Revenue Management via Stochastic Approximation</br><br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Cornell University, Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, United States, ht88@cornell.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a stochastic approximation method to compute bid prices in network revenue management problems. The idea is to visualize the total expected revenue as a function of the bid prices and to use sample path-based derivatives to search for a good set of bid prices. Computational experiments demonstrate that our method is especially advantageous when the bid prices are not recomputed frequently.</br>
