        <br>Title: On the Design of Electricity Markets</br><br>Author: Luciano De Castro, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, l-decastro@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rakesh Vohra</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that electricity markets should be organized around spot markets, regulated to forestall the exercise of market power. We point out innumerous problems with spot markets and propose a different way of organizing electricity markets, motivated by mechanism design. We show that the optimal mechanism is an auction of option contracts for capacity, but with non-uniform pricing. This is superior to the standard approach in terms of information revelation and efficiency.</br>
