        <br>Title: Dynamic Priority Optimization for the Management of an E-commerce   Web Service</br><br>Author: Robert Hampshire, Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, hamp@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a dynamic optimization arising in the management of an   e-commerce web site. We investigate a profit maximizing dynamic priority   scheme for an e-commerce web site in the presence of fluctuating   customer arrivals. An e-commerce web site is constrained by the number   of available web servers, hence service capacity. Customers share that   service capacity simultaneously via the processor sharing discipline. If   customers are allocated server capacity according to their expected   purchase amount, then a dynamic priority scheme can be developed to   maximize the amount of profit generated by such an e-commerce web site.   This work proposes such a dynamic scheme and exams its properties.</br>
