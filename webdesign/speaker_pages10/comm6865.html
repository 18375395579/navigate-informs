        <br>Title: Expectation-based Versus Potential-aware Automated Abstraction in Imperfect Information Games</br><br>Author: Andrew Gilpin, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, gilpin@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tuomas Sandholm</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Automated abstraction algorithms for sequential imperfect information  games are a key component in developing competitive game theory-based  agents. Previously, agents whose construction has used automated  abstraction have only been compared under confounding effects. We  conduct systematic experiments on Rhode Island Hold'em poker,  comparing abstraction algorithms against each other, against optimal  play, and against each agent's nemesis.</br>
