        <br>Title: Reputation in Online Service Marketplaces</br><br>Author: Antonio Moreno-Garcia, Kellogg School of Management, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, 60208, United States of America, a-morenogarcia@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Online service marketplaces allow service buyers to post their projects and service providers to bid for them. In order to reduce the transactional risks, previous seller performance is usually reflected in a numerical reputation score. By analyzing a detailed dataset with more than 1,800,000 bids corresponding to 270,000 projects posted between 2001 and 2010 in a leading on-line intermediary for software development services, we empirically study the effects of reputation on market outcomes.</br>
