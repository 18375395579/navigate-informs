        <br>Title: Price and Capacity Competition</br><br>Author: Asu Ozdaglar, Professor, EECS/MIT, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, United States, asuman@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kostas Bimpikis, Daron Acemoglu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the efficiency of oligopoly equilibria in a model where firms compete over capacities and prices. We establish the existence of pure strategy subgame perfect equilibria and characterize the set of equilibria. We then investigate the efficiency properties of these equilibria, where efficiency is defined as the ratio of surplus in equilibrium relative to the first best.</br>
