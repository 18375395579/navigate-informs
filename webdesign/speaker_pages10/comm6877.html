        <br>Title: An Empirical Analysis of Price, Quality, and Incumbency in Online Procurement Auctions</br><br>Author: Fang (Vivian) Zhong, Rotterdam School of Management, Room T09-22,, Postbox 1738, Rotterdam, Netherlands, FZhong@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): D.J. Wu, Tunay Tunca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Using online reverse auctions to procure business services is growing  in the practice of e-procurement. However, the impact of these auctions on the procurement outcomes is unclear. In this study, we  demonstrate empirically that online auctions for business services  can achieve sustainable cost reduction, without sacrifcing supplier  quality. We also analyze the effect of incumbent status in supplier  selection decisions and offer novel insights on the role of incumbency  in online auctions.</br>
