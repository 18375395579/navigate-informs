        <br>Title: Efficient Allocation of Online Advertising Resources</br><br>Author: Thomas Weber, Assistant Professor, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, Terman Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305-4026, United States, webert@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abhishek Bapna</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We provide a general mechanism for the allocation of a finite number of divisible online advertising resources to a finite number of heterogeneous firms. The mechanism is ex-post efficient and dominant-strategy incentive compatible. The mechanism is robust in the sense that equilibrium bid functions do not depend on any assumptions about other players except for smoothness and monotonicity of their otherwise arbitrary payoff functions.</br>
