        <br>Title: On the Value of Dynamic Pricing</br><br>Author: Miguel Lobo, Assistant Professor, Duke University, 1 Towerview Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, mlobo@duke.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In problems with model uncertainty, dynamic pricing policies with learning are potentially valuable. I define a typology of problems and prove bounds on the value of dynamic pricing for each type and make pricing policy recommendations. Learning is only valuable in uncapacitated problems with elasticity uncertainty, and in capacitated problems with magnitude uncertainty. Price exploration is only valuable in uncapacitated problems where the elasticity uncertainty is above a given level.</br>
