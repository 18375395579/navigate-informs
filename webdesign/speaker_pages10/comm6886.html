        <br>Title: Optimal Allocation for Display Advertising</br><br>Author: De Liu, Associate Professor, Gatton College of Business and Economics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States of America, de.liu@uky.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Huaxia Rui, Andrew Whinston</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The spread of real-time display advertising creates a new challenge: how to efficiently allocate countless categories of impressions. We propose a new contingent contract based approach, in which a provider can offer each ad buyer variable quantities contingent on the realized number of impressions. The key advantages of this approach include accommodating heterogenious risk preferences, achieving better allocation efficiency, and joint allocation of multiple categories.</br>
