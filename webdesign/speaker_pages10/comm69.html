        <br>Title: Existence of Stable Matchings in Large Markets with Complementarities</br><br>Author: Eduardo Azevedo, Assistant Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 3620 Locust Walk, Wharton School, SHDH 1400, Philadelphia, PA, 19104-6302, United States of America, eazevedo@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: It is known that in matching markets the existence of a stable outcome can be guaranteed if and only if preferences are substitutable and contracts are bilateral. We show that, in markets with a continuum of each type of agent, it is only necessary that agents on one side of the market have substitutable preferences to guarantee the existence of a stable outcome. In addition, we show that, with general preferences, the core is nonempty, and that stable matchings always exist with transfers.</br>
