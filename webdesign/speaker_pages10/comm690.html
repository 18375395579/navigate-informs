        <br>Title: Combinatorial Auction for Multi-period Distributed Resource Allocation</br><br>Author: Shih-Fen Cheng, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, 80 Stamford Road, 178902, Singapore, sfcheng@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hoong Chuin Lau, Thin Yin Leong</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we consider the problem of resource allocation where information and optimization decisions are decentralized. Our goal is to find an efficient mechanism that allows resources from a central pool to be allocated to selfish decision makers (agents). We propose a generic combinatorial auction mechanism for this type of problems, and show how agents can design optimal bidding strategies. We also demonstrate how we can extend our approach to handle cases with stochastic demands.</br>
