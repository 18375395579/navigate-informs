        <br>Title: Signaling Quality via Stock-outs</br><br>Author: Laurens Debo, Associate Professor, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, laurens.debo@chicagobooth.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Garrett van Ryzin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: When some consumers are uncertain about a product's quality, product availability conveys information about the propensity of other, better-informed, consumers to purchase. The willingness-to-pay of less-informed consumers may therefore increase after observing a stock-out. We develop a model in which the firm can harvest the increased willingness-to-pay after a stock-out via its pricing strategy later in the season.</br>
