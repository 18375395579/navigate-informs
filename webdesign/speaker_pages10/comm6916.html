        <br>Title: Increasing Revenues from Parking Tickets</br><br>Author: Nichalin Summerfield, Adjunct lecturer, University of Arizona, 1130 E. Helen Street, Mclnd 430, Tucson, United States of America, nichalin@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Morris Cohen, Moshe Dror</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Parking inspection is modeled as a revenue collecting Chinese Postman Problem. This approach maximizes expected revenues. We investigate online rules that allow the enforcement officers to adjust their routes in response to the observed parking permits' times. Allowing an officer to selectively wait by legally parked cars till their permit expires could increase the expected revenues by 7%.</br>
