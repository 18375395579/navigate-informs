        <br>Title: Motivating Innovation</br><br>Author: Gustavo Manso, MIT Sloan School of Management 50 Memorial Drive E52-446, Cambridge, MA, manso@MIT.EDU</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The paper shows that incentive schemes that motivate innovation are fundamentally different from standard pay-for-performance incentive schemes. The optimal compensation scheme that motivates innovation exhibits substantial tolerance (or even reward) for early failure and reward for long-term success. Moreover, job security, commitment to a long-term compensation plan and timely feedback on performance are essential ingredients to motivate innovation.</br>
