        <br>Title: Asymmetric Auctions with Resale</br><br>Author: Isa Hafalir</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vijay Krishna</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study first- and second-price auctions in which, after the auction, the winner may resell the object to the other bidder. When bidders take resale possibilities into account, the first-price auction has a unique monotone equilibrium. The revenue from a first-price auction with resale exceeds that from a second-price auction.</br>
