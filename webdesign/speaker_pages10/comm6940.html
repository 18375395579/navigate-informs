        <br>Title: Probabilistic Broad Match for Multi-keyword Sponsored Search Auctions</br><br>Author: Tie-Yan Liu, Senior Researcher, Microsoft Research Asia, No. 5, Danling Street, Haidian District, Beijing, China, tyliu@microsoft.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Chen, Di He, Liwei Wang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a Probabilistic Broad Match mechanism for sponsored search auctions. Different from the existing mechanism that runs auction for ads bidding on all the keywords matched to a query, the new mechanism only runs auction for the ads bidding on a randomly sampled keyword each time. We prove the new mechanism to have better properties in terms of the existence of pure Nash equilibrium, a better POA bound for social welfare, and a better guarantee of search engine revenue in equilibrium.</br>
