        <br>Title: Algorithmic Game Theory: Artificial Agents Play, Learn ,and Produce Surprising, Instructive Results</br><br>Author: Steven Kimbrough, Professor, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, kimbrough@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Frederic Murphy</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We report results from recent work in algorithmic studies of strategic interaction.  When games are indefinitely repeated the predictions of classical game theory become much less specific.  Robust, more concrete predictions can be made if we assume that agents engage in simple, plausible learning regimes.  We report and discuss the significance of  results from standard 2x2 games, from oligopoly models involving 2 and more than 2 agents, and from bargaining and coalition formation models.</br>
