        <br>Title: Humanitarian Staff Reassignment: Introducing 'Almost Acceptable' Complete Stable Matchings</br><br>Author: Mallory Soldner, PhD Candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, msoldner@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ozlem Ergun, Julie Swann</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Humanitarian organizations regularly face the challenge of reassigning staff members to different positions. To bridge the gap between incomplete matchings and the requirement of continuing employment for all employees and covering all positions, we introduce models to adapt the widely accepted and implemented stable matching framework. We seek minimal modifications to agent preferences to achieve complete matchings, while maintaining that the final result meets stability properties.</br>
