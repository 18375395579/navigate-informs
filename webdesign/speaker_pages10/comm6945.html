        <br>Title: Inverse Principal-Agent Paradigm: Application to Health Care Delivery</br><br>Author: Donald Lee, Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect St, Box 208200, New Haven, CT, United States of America, dkklee@cantab.net</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stefanos Zenios</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: How should dialysis providers be paid for patient outcomes along multiple dimensions? Principal-agent models can in theory be used to construct a pay-for-performance system for Medicare’s dialysis program, but little is known about the underlying model parameters. We develop a procedure for inferring the provider's cost parameters from its past outcomes, making it possible to implement the optimal payment system. Numerical results will be presented.</br>
