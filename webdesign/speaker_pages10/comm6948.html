        <br>Title: The Effect of Product Class on the Usage of Buy-now Price in Online Auctions</br><br>Author: Chun Qiu, Assistant Professor, McGill University, Desautels Faculty of Management, Montreal, QC, Canada, chun.qiu@mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Popkowski-Leszcyc, Kursad Asdemir</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the moderating effects of product class and ease of assessing the value of an item on the effectiveness of buy-now prices in online auctions.   Buy-now prices may serve different purposes, which vary depending on the product class.  In particular, buy-now prices may serve as external reference prices for high-end high uncertain products.  On the other hand buy-now options may serve to accelerate sales for low-end products. We provide empirical results to support our conjectures.</br>
