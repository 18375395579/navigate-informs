        <br>Title: Incentives and Stability in Large Two-Sided Matching Markets</br><br>Author: Fuhito Kojima, PhD Candidate, Department of Economics, Harvard University, 1875 Cambridge Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, United States, kojima@fas.harvard.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The paper analyzes the scope for manipulation in college admission problems under the student-optimal stable mechanism when the number of participants is large. The fraction of colleges that have incentives to misrepresent their preferences approaches zero as the market becomes large. Truthful reporting is an approximate equilibrium in large markets that are sufficiently thick, a condition that allows for certain types of heterogeneity in the distribution of student preferences.</br>
