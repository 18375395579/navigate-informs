        <br>Title: Real-Time Dynamic Pricing with Minimal and Flexible Price Adjustment</br><br>Author: George Chen, University of Michigan, 701 Tappan Street, R0402, Ann arbor, Mi, 48109, United States of America, georgeqc@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Izak Duenyas, Stefanus Jasin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a dynamic pricing problem in network RM. Two common concerns with dynamic pricing are the expensive optimization and the frequency of price adjustments. To address these, we propose a real-time re-optimization free heuristic. The heuristic can make significant improvement over static pricing by adjusting the price of a small set of products sufficiently rarely. It is also possible to dynamically adjust different sets of products while keeping equivalent revenue.</br>
