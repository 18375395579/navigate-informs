        <br>Title: Dynamic Pricing using Scenario Based Optimization</br><br>Author: Ruben Lobel, rlobel@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Georgia Perakis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We discuss a dynamic pricing problem under fixed capacities. Demand is a function of the price with uncertain parameters. We develop a scenario based optimization model to find a closed-loop pricing strategy that maximizes revenue robustly, without making distributional assumptions on the uncertainty. We provide a bound on the number of scenario samples that achieve a desired confidence level for this solution. We also present numerical results to support our findings.</br>
