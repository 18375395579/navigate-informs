        <br>Title: An Observation of Optimization Horizon Impact on Apartment RM Pricing</br><br>Author: Montgomery Blair, AVP, Archstone-Smith, MBlair@archstonesmith.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jian Wang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Optimization horizon is often pre-specified in many applications of revenue management (RM). Different selection of optimization horizons has significant effects on dynamic pricing behaviors. Little theoretical research has been done on how to determine an “optimal?horizon in published literatures. Based on a real apartment RM system, we simulated how rental pricing changed to a wide range of optimization horizon selections, and suggested some criteria to pick the “proper?horizon.</br>
