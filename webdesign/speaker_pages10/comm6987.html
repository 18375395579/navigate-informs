        <br>Title: The Impact of Customer Heterogeneity on Service Satisfaction</br><br>Author: Ryan Buell, Assistant Professor, Harvard Business School, Morgan Hall T37, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, rbuell@hbs.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dennis Campbell, Frances Frei</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We decompose the variance of 58,294 face-to-face retail banking transactions, quantifying the relative importance of customer, employee, process, location and market-level effects on satisfaction outcomes. We find that customer-level differences account for most of the explained aggregate variance, demonstrate that customer compatibility with the operating model is a primary determinant of service outcomes, and show that firms facing greater heterogeneity have less satisfied customers.</br>
