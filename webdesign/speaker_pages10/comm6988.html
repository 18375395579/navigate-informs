        <br>Title: A Kernel-based Combinatorial Auction</br><br>Author: Sebastien Lahaie, Microsoft Research, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, United States of America, sebastien.lahaie@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present an iterative combinatorial auction that offers modularity in the choice of price structure, drawing on ideas from kernel methods. The auction is able to detect whether price complexity must be increased to clear the market, and converges to a sparse representation of nonlinear clearing prices. We also show that regularization enables the auction to compute approximate truth-inducing payments in a single run, in contrast to VCG payments which require as many runs as there are bidders.</br>
