        <br>Title: On the Accuracy of Announcing the Delay of Last to Enter Service in Large Call Centers</br><br>Author: Achal Bassamboo, Northwestern University, a-bassamboo@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mor Armony</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In recent times, many call-centers announce some estimate of the wait to callers when they are not served immediately. In response to the delay announcement callers may balk or be willing to wait for their service. In this talk we consider a simple delay announcement to a new caller: The delay of the last customer to enter service (DLS). We show that these announcements are quite accurate when the system size is large.</br>
