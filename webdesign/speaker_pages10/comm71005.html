        <br>Title: Selective Commitment and Selective Margin: Techniques to Minimize Cost in an IaaS Cloud</br><br>Author: Yu-Ju Hong, Purdue University, 2550 Yeager Rd Apt 12-1, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, United States of America, yujuhong@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mithuna Thottethodi, Jiachen Xue</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We aim to minimize compute cost for day-to-day operations in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud, while satisfying statistical response-time targets. First, a dynamic programming algorithm is used to compute load-dependent margins (a set of servers to handle unexpected load bursts). Second, we exploit the differences of price/commitment of on-demand and reserved virtual machine instances. Simulations with real Web server traces using Amazon EC2 cost model show 21% of average cost saving.</br>
