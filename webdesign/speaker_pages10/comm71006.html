        <br>Title: Finite Time  Bounds for Stochastic Approximation Algorithms</br><br>Author: Assaf Zeevi, Professor, Columbia Business School, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, assaf@gsb.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Deniz Cicek, Mark Broadie</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the Kiefer-Wolfowitz stochastic approximation algorithm for sequentially estimating the point of maximum of an unknown function from noisy observations. We develop a new and simple proof that  leads to general bounds  on the mean squared error of the algorithm, and show that some assumptions adopted to date are superfluous. The analysis leads to ``speedup'' heuristics as well, improving the transient behavior of such algorithms.</br>
