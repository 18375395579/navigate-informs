        <br>Title: Analysis of Serial Inventory Systems with Batch Ordering and Nested Replenishment Schedule</br><br>Author: Kevin Shang, Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States, khshang@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sean Zhou</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider an N-stage serial inventory system where material is ordered in batches and according to a nested schedule. There are two types of fixed cost considered in this system: setup cost and order cost. The former is associated with each batch ordered; the latter is incurred for each replenishment cycle. We study two models that consider each of these fixed costs. For both models, we construct a lower bound to the optimal cost, an optimization algorithm, and an effective heuristic.</br>
