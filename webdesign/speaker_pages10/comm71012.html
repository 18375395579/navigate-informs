        <br>Title: Inventory Optimization for Large-scale ATO Systems</br><br>Author: Willem van Jaarsveld, PhD Student, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, 3000 DR, Netherlands, vanjaarsveld@ese.eur.nl</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We provide insights and algorithms to improve inventory control in industrial-sized Assemble-To-Order systems. We develop SP-based algorithms that find provably close-to-optimal solutions for large systems. We use those algorithms to gain the first conclusive insights into the performance of heuristics that have been used by companies such as Dell and IBM to optimize component inventories in large, general ATO systems.</br>
