        <br>Title: A Many-server FWLLN for Queueing Networks with Time-varying Parameters and Markovian Routing</br><br>Author: Ahmet Korhan Aras, Ph.D. student, North Carolina State University, 2152 Burlington Labs, 2500 Stinson Drive, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, akaras@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yunan Liu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A many-server heavy-traffic FWLLN is established for the (G_t/GI/s_t+GI)^m/M_t queueing network allowing customer abandonment, general service times, time-varying arrival rates, time-varying staffing levels, and  customer feedbacks (after service completions) in a Markovian fashion. This limit theorem, extending the FWLLN for single queues, provides a rigorous mathematical justification and solid theoretical basis for a previously proposed deterministic network fluid approximation.</br>
