        <br>Title: Achieving Rapid Recovery in an Overload Control for Large-scale Service Systems</br><br>Author: Ohad Perry, Assistant Professor, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America, ohad.perry@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ward Whitt</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider how two large service pools can help each other in a time-varying environment involving periods of overloads. In particular, we analyze a fluid approximation of the system and seek an automatic routing policy. We show that the fluid is bi-stable during periods of normal loads, with a periodic equilibrium. There is therefore a need to sacrifice some optimality so as to avoid congestion collapse due to the oscillatory behavior of the fluid model.</br>
