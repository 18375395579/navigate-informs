        <br>Title: Minimizing Total Weighted Completion Time with Unexpected Machine Unavailability</br><br>Author: Yumei Huo, Associate Professor, CUNY at Staten Island, Staten Island, NY, 10314, United States of America, yumei.huo@csi.cuny.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hairong Zhao, Boris Reznichenko</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing total weighted completion time on a single machine without any knowledge about the unavailable interval due to breakdown or emergent jobs. For both breakdown model and emergent job model, we show the lowerbounds for any online algorithms, the tight competitive ratios of LPT algorithm, and the tight approximation ratios of First Fit LPT for offline case. Finally, our experimental results show that in practice, both LPT and FF- LPT perform very well.</br>
