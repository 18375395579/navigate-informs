        <br>Title: Prioritization in Services when Customer Types are Unknown</br><br>Author: Zhankun Sun, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 2000 Baity Hill Dr, Apt 215, Chapel Hill, NC, 27514, United States of America, szk@unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nilay Tanik Argon, Serhan Ziya</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a service system with two types of customers. The type of each customer is unknown but the server has the option of performing triage and making an imperfect classification. Each customer incurs a linear waiting cost depending on its type. The server has to weigh the benefit of triage and prioritization under imperfect information against the cost of delay by triage. We characterize the optimal dynamic and static policies that minimize the expected cost.</br>
