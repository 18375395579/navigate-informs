        <br>Title: Inventory Control with Satisfaction-dependent Future Demand</br><br>Author: Justin Azadivar, University of California - Berkeley, University of California - Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States, jazad@berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Shanthikumar, Max Shen</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Inventory control decisions are made based on assumptions and estimates   of demand levels. But those decisions also affect demand levels, and a  complete inventory control model recognizes the use of control decisions  to both meet current demand and modify future demand. In this paper, we  look at a simple inventory control model with a demand that responds to  satisfaction of previous demand and propose a simple framework to  determine the value of these control decisions.</br>
