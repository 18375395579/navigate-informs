        <br>Title: Technology Enabled Hybrid Inventory Control Policies in Hospitals</br><br>Author: Claudia Rosales, PhD Candidate, University of Cincinnati, 523 Linder Hall, College of Business Administration, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, United States of America, rosalecr@email.uc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Uday Rao, Mike Magazine</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: New technology has emerged to improve availability and control of medical supplies in hospitals. Pyxis SupplyStations, which allow continuous inventory tracking, have enabled new inventory practices such as a hybrid inventory policy. This policy combines the option to perform periodic replenishments with the flexibility of additional replenishments any time stockouts are imminent. In single- and multiple-item systems, we study the impact of the new hybrid inventory policy.</br>
