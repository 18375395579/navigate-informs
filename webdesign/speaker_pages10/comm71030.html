        <br>Title: An Optimal Approximate Dynamic Programming Algorithm to a Mutual Fund Problem</br><br>Author: Juliana Nascimento, PhD Candidate, Princeton University, Olden Street, Equad Room E-307, Princeton, NJ, 08544, United States, jnascime@princeton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Warren B. Powell</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present an approximate dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the level of cash that is held by a mutual fund in order to meet redemption requests from investors. Demand for redemptions and shortfall/surplus costs are stochastic. The algorithm uses a pure exploitation scheme and does not require knowledge of the distribution of any of the random variables. A proof of convergence to an optimal policy is obtained exploring structural properties of the problem.</br>
