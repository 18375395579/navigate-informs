        <br>Title: Decentralized Control Policies for Large-Scale Vehicle Sharing Systems</br><br>Author: David George, Operations Research Analyst, Monsanto Company, Maryland Heights, MO, 63146, United States of America, david.k.george@monsanto.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cathy Xia</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: With the increasing scale and complexity of today's vehicle sharing systems, centralized approaches for their management tend to be impractical. In this research, we present a decentralized approach, based on a closed queueing network model, for maintaining balanced vehicle inventories across the network. In addition to decisions of vehicle repositioning and customer admission, our decentralized solution suggests a mechanism for the dynamic pricing of vehicle rentals based on network congestion.</br>
