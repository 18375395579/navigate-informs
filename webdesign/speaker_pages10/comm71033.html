        <br>Title: Network Creation Games</br><br>Author: MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi, Senior Researcher, AT&T Labs- Research, Rm: C225, 180 Park Ave., Florham Park, NJ, 08904, United States of America, hajiagha@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study Nash equilibria in the setting of network creation  games introduced recently by Fabrikant, Luthra, Maneva,  Papadimitriou and Shenker. In this game we have a set of  selfish node players, each creating some incident links, and  the goal is to minimize x times the cost of the created links  plus sum of the distances to all other players. Fabrikant et  al. proved an upper bound O(sqrt{n}) on the price of anarchy.  In this talk, we prove the first o(n^\epsilon) upper bound for  general x.</br>
