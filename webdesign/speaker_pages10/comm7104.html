        <br>Title: Robust Transient Queueing Theory</br><br>Author: Nataly Youssef, Graduate Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 143 Albany St., Apt. 014C, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, youssefn@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chaithanya Bandi, Dimitris Bertsimas</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the transient behavior of queueing systems by employing robust optimization as opposed to stochastic analysis by modeling queue primitives using uncertainty sets.We provide closed form solutions for the transient behavior of the departure process, waiting and relaxation times for multi-server and tandem queues under possibly heavy tailed arrivals and services. Our results agree with simulation results while providing qualitative insights lacking from traditional queueing models.</br>
