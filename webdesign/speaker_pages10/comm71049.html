        <br>Title: Proactive Resource Allocation Heuristics for Robust Project Scheduling</br><br>Author: Filip Deblaere, K.U.Leuven, Research Center for OM, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, B-3000, Belgium, Filip.Deblaere@econ.kuleuven.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erik Demeulemeester, Willy Herroelen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The resource-constrained project scheduling problem involves the determination of a predictive schedule of the project activities satisfying the precedence relations and resource constraints while minimizing the project duration. During execution of the project, activity duration disruptions may disturb this schedule. We propose procedures for allocating resources to activities in order to maximize schedule stability. We report on computational results obtained on a set of benchmark problems.</br>
