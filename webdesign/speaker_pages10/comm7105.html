        <br>Title: Buffer and Server Allocation in General Queueing Networks</br><br>Author: Tom van Woensel, Eindhoven University of Technology, PO BOX 513, Eindhoven, NL, Netherlands, t.v.woensel@tm.tue.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ricky Andriansyah, Frederico Cruz</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Optimization of manufacturing systems is the focus of a number of studies. Of interest here is the optimization of the number of buffers and servers, since both of them represent a significant amount of investment in a company. The joint buffer-server optimization is a nonlinear, multiple-objective optimization problem with integer decision variables. Numerical results are presented.</br>
