        <br>Title: Dynamics of Bucket Brigades in Systems with Fixed Stations</br><br>Author: Esma Gel, Associate Professor, Arizona State University, Dept of Industrial Engineering, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States of America, Esma.Gel@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erika Murguia, Dieter Armbruster</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the dynamics and throughput of a bucket brigade when work has to be conducted in stations that can only be occupied by a single worker. We first analyze the case of two worker lines, and extend some results to more general systems. We provide several managerial insights on the performance of bucket brigades in such environments using the amount of blocking that the line incurs under various assumptions.</br>
