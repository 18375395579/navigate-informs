        <br>Title: A Parallelizable Dynamic Fleet Management Model with Random Travel Times and Multiple Vehicle Types</br><br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, 223 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, huseyin@orie.cornell.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present a fleet management model to handle random load arrivals, random travel times and multiple vehicles types. Our model decomposes the problem into a sequence of time-indexed subproblems by formulating it as a dynamic program and uses approximations of the value function. To handle random travel times, the state variable of our dynamic program includes all decisions over a portion of the history, but we approximate this high-dimensional value function in a tractable manner.</br>
