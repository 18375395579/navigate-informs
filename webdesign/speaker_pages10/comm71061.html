        <br>Title: Formulation Choice in Call Centers: Service-level Differentiation Revisited</br><br>Author: Seung Bum Soh, Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, IL, United States of America, seung-soh@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Itai Gurvich</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study formulation choice for call-center staffing. We formalize an intuitive notion of Service-Level Differentiation and show how the staffing and prioritization rules depend on the choice of differentiation-degree. We prove the convexity of the staffing cost as a function of the differentiation degree. We also prove that monotone-index policies that are appealing and widely used in practice are, in fact, optimal under the appropriate formalization of service-level differentiation.</br>
