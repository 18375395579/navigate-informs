        <br>Title: Double-sided Batch-arrival Queues with Abandonment: Modeling and Performance of Crossing Networks</br><br>Author: Adam Diamant, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St.George Street, Toronto, ON, Canada, Adam.Diamant09@rotman.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Philipp Afeche, Joseph Milner</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The growing significance of crossing networks in financial markets calls for a better understanding of their operational performance.  We model these as double-sided batch arrival queues with abandonment. We analyze how key performance measures such as system times and fill rates depend on order flow characteristics. We (1) derive closed-form expressions for these measures; (2) gain insights on system-level and customer-level performance; (3) validate our analytical results via simulation.</br>
