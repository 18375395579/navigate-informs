        <br>Title: Performance Bounds on Optimal Fixed Prices and A New Heuristic for Dynamic Pricing</br><br>Author: Alper Sen, Bilkent University, Dept of IE, Ankara, 06800, Turkey, alpersen@bilkent.edu.tr</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of selling a fixed stock of items over a finite horizon. We obtain a general lower bound on the performance of using a fixed price rather than dynamically adjusting the price. The bound is 63.21% for one unit of inventory and improves as the inventory increases. For the one unit case, we also obtain tight bounds: 89.85% for the constant elasticity and 96.93% for the linear price response functions. We also suggest a new simple, near-optimal dynamic pricing heuristic.</br>
