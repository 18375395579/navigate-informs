        <br>Title: Simultaneous Production and Maintenance Scheduling Using In-line Equipment Condition and Yield Information</br><br>Author: Thomas Sloan, Professor, UMass Lowell, College of Management, One University Avenue, Lowell, MA, 01854, United States of America, Thomas_Sloan@uml.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Equipment condition can have a significant impact on product quality. We present a semi-Markov decision process model of a single-stage production system with multiple products and multiple maintenance actions. The model simultaneously determines maint. and production schedules, accounting for the fact that equipment condition affects the yield of each product differently. Structural results of the optimal policy are explored and numerical examples high-lighting important factors are presented.</br>
