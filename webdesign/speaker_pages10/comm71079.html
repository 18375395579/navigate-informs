        <br>Title: Non-Markovian State-dependent Networks in Critical Loading</br><br>Author: Chihoon Lee, Colorado State University, 221 Statistics Building (CB#1877), Fort Collins, CO, 80523-1877, United States of America, chihoon@stat.colostate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anatolii Puhalskii</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We establish heavy traffic limit theorems for queue-length processes in critically loaded single class queueing networks with state-dependent   arrival and service rates. A distinguishing feature of our model is  non-Markovian state dependence. The limit stochastic process is a continuous-path reflected process on the nonnegative orthant. We give an application to generalized Jackson networks with state-dependent rates.</br>
