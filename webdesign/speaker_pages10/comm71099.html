        <br>Title: A Provably Near-optimal Sampling-based Algorithm for the Capacity Allocation Problem</br><br>Author: Thiam Lee, IEOR Department, Columbia University, 500 West 120th St, Mudd 323, New York, NY, United States, thl2102@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Woonghee Tim Huh, Retsef Levi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider yield management capacity allocation with monotonic fare classes and independent demands, but with unknown demand distributions. Instead, we assume access to a black box that generates uncensored samples from the true distributions. We give an algorithm to compute from samples a nested protection level policy, and prove an upper bound for the number of samples needed to guarantee that that policy is epsilon-optimal with probability 1-delta for any epsilon>0 and delta>0.</br>
