        <br>Title: A Newsboy Location-inventory Model with Time-sensitive Demands</br><br>Author: M. Mahdi Tajbakhsh, Dr., Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, 105 St. George St., Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, Mahdi.Tajbakhsh@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dmitry Krass, Oded Berman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a supply chain design problem in which facility location and inventory management decisions are integrated. We assume an infinite-horizon newsboy inventory policy at distribution centers (DCs) and allow customer demands to be sensitive to delivery times from the DCs. Our model is general in that it is applicable to a wide range of demand distributions and can handle both shortage costs and service levels.</br>
