        <br>Title: Integrated Staffing and Scheduling for Service Systems via Stochastic Integer Programming</br><br>Author: James Luedtke, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Ave, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, jrluedt1@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Merve Bodur</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the joint problem of staffing (determining how many servers of each type should be available in each time period) and scheduling (assigning servers to feasible schedules) in a service system having multiple server types and multiple customer classes.  We introduce a stochastic integer programming formulation and study solution methods for this problem class.</br>
