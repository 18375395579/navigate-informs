        <br>Title: Demand Management for Optimal Workforce Planning in Professional Service Firms</br><br>Author: Vincent Hargaden, University College Dublin, School of Mech & Materials Eng, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland, vincent.hargaden@ucd.ie</br><br>Coauthor(s): Amir Azaron, Jennifer Ryan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Our previous work has focused on characterizing and modeling the workforce planning process in professional service firms. In this, we initially assumed customer projects, i.e., demand, have fixed start dates. However, this can lead to firms not being able to fulfil all demand due to insufficient supply of workers/skills at certain points in time. We now extend our model to allow firms better manage their demand and worker/skill availability by identifying the optimum set of project start dates.</br>
