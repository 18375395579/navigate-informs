        <br>Title: Asymptotic Analysis for a System with Reneging</br><br>Author: Katsunobu Sasanuma, PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, katz@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Hampshire, Alan Scheller-Wolf</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: It is known that a simple square staffing rule can be used when obtaining the necessary number of staffs in a service center with no reneging. However, under reneging condition, such a simple square staffing rule does not hold. In this talk, we propose a new method to analyze asymptotic property of a system with reneging. We also show a revised staffing rule for a system with reneging.</br>
