        <br>Title: Sensory-Driven Prognostic Models for Adaptive Spare Parts Logistics</br><br>Author: Alaa Elwany, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States, alaa-elwany@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nagi Gebraeel</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Logistical decisions in maintenance management are among the most important decisions in the scope of Supply Chain Management. This research focuses on the development of adaptive decision models related to equipment replacement and spare part inventory using real-time prognostic information. The proposed framework is used to determine optimal replacement and component ordering times in a sense and respond environment.</br>
