        <br>Title: Using Estimated Patience Levels to Optimally Schedule Customers</br><br>Author: Achal Bassamboo, Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, IL, United States of America, a-bassamboo@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ramandeep Randhawa</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Customer impatience has become an integral component of analyzing services, especially in the context of call centers. As customers wait in the queue, an update can be formed on their willingness to wait, or patience, as time progresses. So, even though all customers may be identical when they just join the queue, as time progresses, they become differentiated on their further willingness to wait. In this talk, we characterize the optimal scheduling of customers based on their updated patience.</br>
