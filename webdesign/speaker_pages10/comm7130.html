        <br>Title: Perishable Inventory Systems with Random Replenishments</br><br>Author: David Perry, University of Haifa, Department of Statistics, Haifa, 26250, Israel, dperry@stat.haifa.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wolfgang Stadje</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A guide to perishable inventory systems (PIS's) that are refilled by randomly arriving items and not by ordering decisions is introduced. The literature on this class of PIS's (for which a blood bank or an organ transplantation center are prominent examples) is sparse. The survey starts with the pioneering work on a prototype model in which item arrivals and demand arrivals form independent Poisson processes. We show how to compute all performance measures of interest for this PIS. Thereafter, extensions in several directions are reviewed, among them (i) PIS's with finite capacity and waiting  demands; (ii) PIS's with renewal item arrival times; (iii) batch arrivals of items  or demands; (iv) actuarial valuation; (v) optimization and control. Some novel  contributions are also introduced.</br>
