        <br>Title: A Refined Linear Program for Network Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Huseyin Topaloglu, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, School of ORIE, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, ht88@cornell.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a refined deterministic linear program for the network revenue management problem. The standard deterministic program keeps the capacity availability in aggregate fashion, whereas our linear program keeps the capacity availability on a time period-by-time period basis. From a computational viewpoint, our refinement appears to translate into increased revenues.</br>
