        <br>Title: Time Consistency in Collective Decisions</br><br>Author: Enrico Diecidue, Associate Professor, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, Enrico.DIECIDUE@insead.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose new evidence on the outcomes achieved by collective and individual decisions over time.  We combine static and longitudinal methods to test four conditions on time preferences: impatience, stationarity, age independence and dynamic consistency. Results: Individuals were impatient and deviated from consistent behavior. On the contrary, groups took patient and highly consistent decisions. The voting mechanism helped groups to converge to dynamically consistent decisions.</br>
