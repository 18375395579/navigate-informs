        <br>Title: Expected Delay Analysis for Constrained Queuing Systems</br><br>Author: Ness Shroff, Ohio Eminent Scholar in Networking and Communications, and Professor of ECE and CSE, The Ohio State University, Department of ECE, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, shroff@ece.osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gagan Gupta</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the expected delay for a general class of shared resource systems, which impose arbitrary constraints on the set of users that can be served simultaneously at any given time. This model has been used to describe input-queued switches and wireless networks. We provide lower and upper bounds for scheduling policies in this system. These bounds lead us to the development of an accurate estimate of the expected delay for the well-known Maximum Weighted Matching (MWM) scheduling policy.</br>
