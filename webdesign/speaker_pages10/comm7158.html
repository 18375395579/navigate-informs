        <br>Title: Asymptotic Optimality of Constant-order Policies for Lost Sales Models with Large Lead Times</br><br>Author: David A. Goldberg, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, dgoldberg9@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Squillante, Mayank Sharma, Yingdong Lu, Dmitriy Katz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Lost sales inventory models with large lead times are difficult to optimize due to the curse of dimensionality.  In this talk we show that when lead times are large, a simple constant-order policy, first studied by Reiman, is nearly optimal. The main insight is that when the lead time is large, so much randomness is injected into the system between when an order is placed and when that order is received, that no algorithm can beat the constant-order policy.</br>
