        <br>Title: Stochastic Scheduling Subject to Preemptive-repeat Breakdowns with Incomplete Information</br><br>Author: Xian Zhou, Associate Professor, The HK Polytechnic University, AMA Department, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong - ROC, maxzhou@polyu.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiaoqiang Cai, Xianyi Wu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We address a stochastic scheduling problem subject to preemptive-repeat machine breakdowns with incomplete information on the processing times and machine up/downtimes. We investigate the probabilistic characteristics of the model and apply the results to derive the optimal static and dynamic policies for a large class of performance measures. Under proper conditions, the optimal dynamic policies can be determined by one-step reward rates.</br>
