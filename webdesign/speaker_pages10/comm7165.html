        <br>Title: Fluid Limits for SRPT Queues</br><br>Author: Christian Gromoll, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia, Department of Mathematics, Charlottesville, VA, 22904, United States, gromoll@math.stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Doug Down, Amber Puha</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Consider a GI/GI/1 queue in which the server employs the SRPT policy: it works on the job with the Shortest Remaining Processing Time, allowing preemption by arriving jobs. We propose a fluid model, and present a functional limit theorem justifying it as an approximation of this system. A key step is to keep track of the frontier, the largest service time of any job that has been in service during the current busy period. This is accomplished using a measure valued state description.</br>
