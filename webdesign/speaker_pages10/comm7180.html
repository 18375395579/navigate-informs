        <br>Title: Dynamic Control of a Closed Two-stage Queueing Network for Ship Production with Outfitting</br><br>Author: Fang Dong, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, ppfang@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Van Oyen, Soroush Saghafian, David Singer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: As an essential and complex part of ship construction, outfitting represents at least 50% of ship construction cost and time. Ship block outfitting is most cheaply done at the steel block fabrication (stage 1), but at increased cost and time, it can be done at the final ship assembly (stage 2). We develop a closed two-stage queueing network MDP model with decisions as to where outfitting is performed to gain insights into optimal scheduling control policies.</br>
