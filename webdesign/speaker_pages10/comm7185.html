        <br>Title: Robust Service System Design</br><br>Author: Juan Ma, Ph.D. Student, Oklahoma State University, 26 N University Place Apt 8, Stillwater, OK, 74075, United States of America, juan.ma@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ying Tat Leung, Manjunath Kamath</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In designing a service system it is critical to balance the cost invested in building and maintaining the system while meeting the system performance requirements specified in the service level agreement. In most cases, input parameters such as demand rate are uncertain and values used for solution design are subject to estimation error. We study the service system design problem using queueing models and prevailing risk measures to yield robust designs that minimize the total lifetime cost.</br>
