        <br>Title: Continuous Mapping Approach to Many-server Heavy Traffic Limit Theorems</br><br>Author: Jim Dai, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, dai@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We show that the continuous mapping theorem, and sometimes together  with a state space collpase result, is sufficient to prove  existing many-server heavy traffic limit theorems in the Halfin-Whitt  regime. The approach applies to parallel-server systems with exponential or phase type   distributions. The customer patience time distribution is assumed to be exponential.</br>
