        <br>Title: Optimal Planning and Scheduling for Multiproduct Batch Plants with Parallel Lines</br><br>Author: Muge Erdirik Dogan, PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Chemical Engineering, Doherty Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, muge@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ignacio Grossmann, John Wassick</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: An integrated approach is presented for optimal planning and scheduling of batch reactors operating in parallel that involve intermediate storage and sequence dependent changeover times. A continuous time MILP model based on slot time representation is proposed for scheduling, while a tight STN relaxation model where the detailed timing constraints and changeovers are replaced by time balances is proposed for planning.</br>
