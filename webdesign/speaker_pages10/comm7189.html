        <br>Title: On Series Jackson Networks and Determinantal Transition Kernels</br><br>Author: Ton Dieker, Postdoc, IBM Research, P.O. Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, t.dieker@proba.ucc.ie</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jon Warren</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Product forms for Jackson networks constitutes a cornerstone in the theory of queueing networks, but much less is known about the so-called time-dependent behavior, i.e. the underlying Markov transition kernels. This talk discusses some recent developments in the context of series Jackson networks. It turns out that determinants appear in the transition kernels, and that these facilitate the analysis of relaxation times. Key ingredients include techniques from random-matrix theory.</br>
