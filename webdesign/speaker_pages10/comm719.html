        <br>Title: Scheduling Competing Agents with Controllable Processing Times</br><br>Author: Guohua Wan, Faculty of Business Administration, University of Macau, Information Systems Program, Taipa, Macau, ghwan@umac.mo</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider several scheduling problems for competing agents, each having a set of jobs and an objective function, and competing for common processing resources. The processing times of jobs are controllable with additional cost. We study the complexity issues and provide some algorithms for the problems.</br>
