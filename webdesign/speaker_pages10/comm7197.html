        <br>Title: The Implications of Utility for Supply Chain Dynamics</br><br>Author: Bob Bordley, General Motors Operations Research, M/C 480-106-256, 30500 Mound Road, Warren, MI, 48090, United States, robert.bordley@gm.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: While most supplier contracts specify fixed deadlines, consumers typically have more flexible preferences over project completion times. If the customer's preferences satisfy utility theory, then this is equivalent to replacing the fixed deadline by a random deadline. This paper examines the implications of this random deadline for supply chain dynamics.</br>
