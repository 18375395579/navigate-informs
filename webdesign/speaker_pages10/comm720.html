        <br>Title: Constructing Fixed Routes for Vehicle Routing Problems with Stochastic Demands</br><br>Author: Emrah Uyar, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, United States, emrah@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Martin Savelsbergh, Alan Erera</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the construction and operation of fixed routes for delivery problems with uncertain customer demands. A customer may or may not place an order on a particular delivery day; the probability that a customer places an order is known. Sample-based feasibility evaluation techniques are developed to accommodate delivery time windows. A novel feature is the  flexibility, at the operational level, for a customer to be visited by one of two vehicles.</br>
