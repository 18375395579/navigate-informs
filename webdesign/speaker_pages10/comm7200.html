        <br>Title: Flexible Servers in Tandem Lines with Setups</br><br>Author: Eser Kirkizlar, Assistant Professor, SUNY-Binghamton, School of Management (AA 272), PO Box 6000, Binghamton, NY, 13902, United States of America, eser@binghamton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sigrun Andradottir, Hayriye Ayhan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the dynamic assignment of flexible servers to stations in the presence of setup costs that are incurred when servers move between stations. The goal is to maximize the long-run average profit in a tandem system with two stations, infinite supply of jobs in front of the first station, infinite storage space after the second station, and a finite buffer between the stations. We investigate how the optimal server assignment policy depends on the magnitude of the setup costs.</br>
