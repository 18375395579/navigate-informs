        <br>Title: Stochastic Analysis and Optimization of Workforce Evolution</br><br>Author: Mayank Sharma, IBM Research, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, mxsharma@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yingdong Lu, Mark Squillante</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop stochastic models for estimating the evolution of a workforce over time based on a given set of policies and conditions. A set of transition probabilities are extracted from historical data and used as base model parameters. We solve the corresponding stochastic optimization problem to determine how the workforce should evolve over time to maximize financial/business objectives. Our solutions can be generally applied to address a broad class of strategic workforce management issues.</br>
