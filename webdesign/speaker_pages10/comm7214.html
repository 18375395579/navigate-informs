        <br>Title: Developing a Tight Lower Bound for a Group Scheduling Problem in Hybrid Flow Shops</br><br>Author: Mir Abbas Bozorgirad, PhD Candidate, Oregon State University, School of Mech, Indust, and Mfgr Engr, 204 Rogers Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331-6001, United States of America, bozorgim@onid.orst.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): R. Logen Logendran</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a tight lower bound for a group scheduling problem in hybrid flow shops where the parallel machines are unrelated. The objective of the problem is to minimize a linear combination of total weighted completion time and total weighted tardiness of jobs. The underlying assumptions include the sequence-dependent setup times and dynamic job release times. The lower bound is developed using a column generation technique and further improved with the help of a branch-and-price algorithm.</br>
