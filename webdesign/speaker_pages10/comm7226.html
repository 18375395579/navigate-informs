        <br>Title: Impact of Product Stocking Decisions on a Bucket Brigade in an E-commerce Fulfillment Warehouse</br><br>Author: Scott Webster, Syracuse University, Whitman School of Management, Syracuse, NY, 13244, United States of America, stwebste@syr.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Ruben, Kum-Khiong Yang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Bucket brigade order picking is a method for retrieving orders from a storage rack. We analyze how the manner in which products are stocked in the rack affects the output rate. We identify conditions where stocking decisions can have a large impact on the output rate and conditions where the impact is minimal. Conditions associated with high impact are high variation in worker skill, high variation in product line volume, and a moderate level of walking-to-picking work content per pick list.</br>
