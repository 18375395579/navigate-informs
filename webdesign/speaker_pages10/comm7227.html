        <br>Title: Allocation of Jobs and Resources to Pooling Centers</br><br>Author: Hui-Chih Hung, Assistant Professor, National University of Singapore, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Singapore, 117576, Singapore, hhc43212@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc Posner</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We simultaneously partition servers and job types into parallel pooling centers.  Each job type has a distinct Poisson arrival rate and WIP weight.  The goal is to minimize the total WIP cost.  For non-identical servers, important monotonic properties are established.  Improved heuristics are evaluated both theoretically and experimentally.</br>
