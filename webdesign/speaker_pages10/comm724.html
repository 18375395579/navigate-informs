        <br>Title: Optimal Flow-line Conditions with Worker Variability</br><br>Author: Frank Bentefouet, Research Assistant, Pennsylvania State University, 1231 South Allen Street, State College, PA, 16801, United States of America, fub3@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Nembhard</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework to study the workforce scheduling problem in an assembly line also called flow line. We investigate the impact of within-worker and between workers variability and discuss the selection of a scheduling policy between fixed and work sharing system.  We characterize the optimal switching time between workers in a system with two tasks and establish the maximum number of changes between assignments when considering a general floor shop.</br>
