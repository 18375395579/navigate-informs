        <br>Title: Approximate Mean Value Analysis of Closed Queueing Networks with Bulk Servers</br><br>Author: Liqiang Liu, Postdoctoral Researcher, EURANDOM, Eindhoven University of Technology, 1.03 Laplace Gebouw, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, 5612 AZ, Netherlands, liu@eurandom.tue.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ivo Adan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by the performance analysis of the picking operations in automated distribution centers, we study a closed multichain queueing network with standard bulk servers and develop several approximations based on the mean value analysis method. We study the goodness of the approximations by numerical experiments.</br>
