        <br>Title: Customer Herding in Queues: Inferring Service Quality from Queue Lengths</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Assistant Professor, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A classic example that illustrates how observed customer behavior impacts other customers?decisions is the selection of a restaurant whose quality is uncertain: Customers often choose a busier restaurant, inferring that other customers in that restaurant know something that they do not know. In an environment with random arrival and service times, customer behavior is reflected in the queue lengths. Queue lengths could signal two factors - potentially higher arrival rates to the server or potentially slower service rate at the server. We focus on the effect of potentially higher arrival rates at a server on the choices of other customers. Rational customers that observe queue lengths at different service providers will complement  their private information about the quality of each service provider with the information they obtain from the queue lengths. In this paper, we study how a market is split between two comparable service providers when there are externalities due to the queue lengths that customers observe. Customers arrive according to a Poisson process to the market. Service times are exponentially distributed with the same rate at each service provider. Based on both private information about the service quality and queue length information, customers decide which queue to join. We find that it may be rational in equilibrium to ignore private information completely and  purchase from the service provider with the longer queue. Further, we show that such choice behavior causes temporary successful periods for a firm. Such periods might alternate with periods when the firm does not receive any customers. We show that a firm that provides higher valuation of service is more likely to succeed in getting more customers. Finally, we also capture the value of information due to congestion in markets where competing services have uncertain quality.</br>
