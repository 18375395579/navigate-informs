        <br>Title: Routing and Staffing in Service Systems with Heterogeneous Servers and Impatient Customers</br><br>Author: Mor Armony, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, New York University, 44 West 4th Street #8-62, New York, NY, 10012, United States, marmony@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Avi Mandelbaum</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by call-centers, we consider queueing systems with homogeneous   customers and multiple server pools. Servers differ with respect to their speed of service. Customers are impatient and may leave the system before their service starts. For such systems we propose simple staffing and routing rules that are jointly asymptotically optimal in the sense that they minimize staffing costs subject to a constraint on the fraction of abandonment, in the limit, as the arrival rate grows large.</br>
