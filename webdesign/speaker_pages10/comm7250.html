        <br>Title: Estimating Customer Service Times using GIS Information</br><br>Author: Shantih Spanton, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, sspanton@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jagadish Jampani, Joseph Geunes</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Currently customer service times are reported manually by crews, leading to potential data entry errors. This project automates the estimation of service times by utilizing onboard GIS data and the customer service sequence.  The close proximity of sequentially serviced customers and lack of a precise work location for large industrial customers adds complexity.  The derived service times can then be used to optimize local train work load balancing.</br>
