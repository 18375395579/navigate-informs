        <br>Title: Applications of Successive Lumping in Optimization of Markov Chains</br><br>Author: Laurens Smit, Universiteit Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands, laurens@pipe.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Katehakis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We discuss a class of Markov chains called successively lumpable for which efficient computation (SLC) of quantities of interest (such as the steady state distributions) for large state spaces is feasible.  We illustrate the applicability of the SLC method with several classical pricing and inventory models.</br>
