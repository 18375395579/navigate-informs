        <br>Title: Inventory Management with Advance Demand Information and Flexible Delivery</br><br>Author: Tong Wang, Ph.D Candidate, Insead, Decision Sciences Area, Fontainebleau Cedex, 77305, France, tong.wang@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Beril Toktay</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider an inventory model with advance demand information and flexible delivery. We develop a lower-bound approximation based on an allocation assumption, and propose protection level heuristics that yield upper bounds on the optimal cost. Numerical analysis quantifies the benefit of delivery flexibility (14% on average) and the optimality gaps of the heuristics (2% on average).</br>
