        <br>Title: Pressure-Based Decentralized Resource Allocation in Stream Processing Systems</br><br>Author: Cathy Xia, Research Staff Member, IBM, 19 Skyline Drive, Hawthorne, NY, 10532, United States, cathyx@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Li Zhang, Zhen Liu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Distributed stream processing architecture has emerged as an appealing solution to coping with the analysis of stream data from dispersed sources. A fundamental problem in such distributed systems is how to best utilize available resources to achieve the optimal overall system performance. Queueing network models are well suited to model such stream processing systems. We present pressure-based decentralized solutions for the dynamic resource allocation problem in the above setting.</br>
