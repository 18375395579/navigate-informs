        <br>Title: Process Flexibility: Analytic Bound on the Performance of K-chain</br><br>Author: Jiawei Zhang, Stern School of Business - NYU, 44 west 4th st, New York, NY, 10012, United States of America, jzhang@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuan Wang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The effectiveness of the long chain has been validated by empirical and theoretical analysis for specific demand distributions. We present an analytic bound on the ratio of the expected sales of the long chain relative to that of full flexibility. Our bound uses only mean and variance of the random demand, but compares very well with the case with known distributions. This suggests the robustness of long chain’s performance under different distributions. We obtain similar bounds for k-chain.</br>
