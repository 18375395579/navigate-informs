        <br>Title: Integrated Scheduling of Production and Distribution with Capacited Vehicles and Production Set-ups</br><br>Author: Su Gao, PhD Candidate, MSIS Department, Rutgers University, PhD Program #76, 180 University Avenue, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States, speed_gao@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ronald Armstrong, Lei Lei</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Coordination of production and distribution is an important issue faced by many industries. We develop a cyclic scheduling model with capacited trucks and products with short-life, set-ups between productions and non-instantaneous routing. We analyze optimal properties of special cases and propose an effective approximation algorithm for the general problem. The objective is to minimize the cycle time subject to the customer demand, product lifespan and capacity constraints.</br>
