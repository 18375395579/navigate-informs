        <br>Title: A Service-based Comparison for Stochastic Clearing Systems</br><br>Author: Sila Cetinkaya, Texas A&M University, Austin, TX, United States of America, sila@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bo Wei, Daren B.H. Cline</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Considering a Poisson demand process, we develop a unified method for calculating average order delay (AOD) under different clearing policies using the view of martingales. Next, we introduce some refined properties of truncated Poisson random variables and offer an analytical comparison of AOD expressions for a fixed clearing frequency, e.g., expected service cycle length. The problem has direct applications in freight consolidation among other stochastic clearing systems.</br>
