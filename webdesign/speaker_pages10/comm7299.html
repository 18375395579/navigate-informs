        <br>Title: Approximation Algorithms for Stochastic Inventory Control Models</br><br>Author: David Shmoys, Professor, Cornell University, 232 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States, shmoys@cs.cornell.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider stochastic inventory control models in which we wish  to coordinate a sequence of orders for stochastic demand over  a finite time horizon with minimum expected overall holding and backlogging costs. Recent results develop new algorithms, aiming to prove guarantees for their performance.  We shall survey several recent papers in this area, presenting results of three separate flavors: algorithms that combine a new amortization approach with a cost balancing technique; the analysis of the sample average approximation; and new ways to build on traditional DP techniques.</br>
