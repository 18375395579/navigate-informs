        <br>Title: Integrated Queuing and Gaming Analsis of Stochastic Assembly Systems</br><br>Author: Ananth Krishnamurthy, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, CII 5015, 110 8th Street, Troy, NY, United States, krisha@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jong-Shi Pang, Ram Ramakrishnan, Jinye Zhao</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic, decentralized assembly system  consisting of two suppliers and one assembler, who decide on  investments on capacities and inventories subject to a common  throughput constraint.  Queuing approximations for the relevant  performance measures are integrated into the players' optimization problems, resulting in a generalized Nash equilibrium problem. Existence of a solution is established and numerical results  are presented.</br>
