        <br>Title: Instability of LQF and FIFO in a System with Arbitrarily High Theoretical Capacity</br><br>Author: Tolga Tezcan, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 117 Transportation Bldg., 104 S. Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, ttezcan@uiuc.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study the stability of commonly used scheduling rules Longest-queue-first (LQF) (and more general versions of LQF) and FIFO. We show that in a relatively simple model known as the X-model they can be unstable even when the system can be made stable with other scheduling rules that keep server utilizations arbitrarily low. Our proof is based on the augmented fluid models.</br>
