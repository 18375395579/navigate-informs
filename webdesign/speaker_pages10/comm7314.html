        <br>Title: Optimal learning for the Newsvendor Problem</br><br>Author: Diana Negoescu, Princeton University, Department of ORFE, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, negoescu@Princeton.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Warren Powell</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Some applications of the newsvendor problem involve measurements that are time-consuming or expensive with high levels of uncertainty.  We explore the use of the knowledge gradient policy, and compare it to other heuristic policies and an optimal measurement policy that applies only for the small class of newsvendor distributions.  We show that the knowledge gradient policy closely matches the optimal while providing a general strategy for a broad range of distributions.</br>
