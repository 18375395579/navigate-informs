        <br>Title: Scheduling Parallel Servers in the Non-degenerate Slowdown Diffusion Regime: Asymptotic Optimality</br><br>Author: Itai Gurvich, Northwestern University - Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, IL, United States of America, i-gurvich@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rami Atar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing holding costs in a parallel-server system operating in a many-server heavy-traffic regime with non-degenerate slowdown (NDS). The NDS many-server regime is distinct from existing heavy-traffic regimes. As in the conventional heavy-traffic regime, the asymptotics are captured by a Brownian control problem, the solution of which exhibits state-space collapse. We prove an asymptotic lower bound and construct a sequence of asymptotically optimal policies.</br>
