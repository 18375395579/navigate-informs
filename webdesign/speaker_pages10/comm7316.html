        <br>Title: Production Scheduling for Fast Pyrolysis Fractionation with Lot-sizing</br><br>Author: Qi Li, Iowa State University, 0076 Black Engineering, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, qili@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Guiping Hu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Fast pyrolysis fractionation is a prominent technology for cellulosic biofuel production.  In the process, a series of condensers and ESPs are used to recover bio-oil into fractions. The fractions could go through different upgrading processes. In this study, a production scheduling problem considering the trade-off between proportional production costs, set-up costs, and inventory costs is studied. Mixed integer linear programming model with lot-sizing is formulated and case study is presented.</br>
