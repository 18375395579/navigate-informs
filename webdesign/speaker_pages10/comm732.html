        <br>Title: Bucket Brigade Dynamics for Discrete Tasks</br><br>Author: Bryan A. Norman, PhD, University of Pittsburgh, 1033 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, banorman@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Natasa Vidic</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study throughput of a bucket brigade when tasks are discrete, production rates are worker/task dependent and workers are idle if blocked. We compare the bucket brigade line throughput with the throughput from a fixed assignment line and define conditions for which bucket brigades are more effective. We substantiate our proofs with numerical examples.</br>
