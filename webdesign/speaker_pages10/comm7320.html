        <br>Title: Stable Coalitions in Inventory Games</br><br>Author: Mahesh Nagarajan, Asst. Professor, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, v6t 1z2, Canada, mahesh.nagarajan@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze consider a class of inventory games in which players have incentives to form coalitions. We analyze stable outcomes in such games as fixed points of suitably defined set valued maps. This framework captures several of the existing dynamic concepts of stability, faciltates efficient, exact and approximate characterizations, where calculating the set of stable outcomes is usually computationally intractable.</br>
