        <br>Title: Optimality of a Static Priority Policy in an N-Model with Many Servers</br><br>Author: Tolga Tezcan, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial & Systems Engineering, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, gte778y@mail.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jim Dai</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a parallel-server system that consists of two customer classes and two server pools. The servers in one of the pools can only process jobs from one buffer, whereas the servers in the other server pool can process jobs from either buffer. Service times are assumed to have exponential distribution and to depend only on the server pool providing the service. We show that a static priority scheduling rule is asymptotically optimal in the Halfin-Whitt many-server regime.</br>
