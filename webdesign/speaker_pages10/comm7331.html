        <br>Title: Large Deviations of Reflected Diffusions and Associated Queueing Networks</br><br>Author: Kavita Ramanan, Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 6208 Wean Hall, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, kramanan@asdf5.math.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Reflected diffusions in the N-dimensional orthant often arise as diffusion approximations to queueing networks. This talk will provide a brief survey of what is known about the large deviation behaviour of this class of reflected diffusions and describe some connections with the large deviation behaviour of associated queueing networks.</br>
