        <br>Title: On the Optimality of Chaining for Flexible Retail and Service Systems</br><br>Author: Ramandeep Randhawa, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 78704, United States of America, Ramandeep.Randhawa@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Achal Bassamboo, Jan Van Mieghem</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: It is known that chained configurations yield good performance. In this talk, we demonstrate that they are in fact optimal in retail and service systems. We provide explicit prescriptions for the optimal configuration of flexibility in inventory systems (newsvendor models). Further, we show that when faced with arrival rate uncertainty and impatient customers, queueing systems reduce to newsvendor models, and thus our results apply to these settings as well.</br>
