        <br>Title: Analysis of Inventory Systems with Remanufacturing of Multi-Types Returns</br><br>Author: Sean Zhou, Assistant Professor, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Department of Systems Engineering & Engi, Hong Kong, HK, China, zhoux@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zhijie Tao, Xiuli Chao</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study periodic-review inventory/production systems with multi-types of return products. We characterize the optimal inventory control policies that minimize the total costs for the systems with and without possible disposal of repairable products.  We show that, under some circumstances, the optimal policy is simple and only given by some state-independent threshold levels. However, under some other scenarios, the optimal policy can also be quite complicated with state-dependent thresholds.</br>
