        <br>Title: Existence of Nonnegative Pareto-Improving Tolls</br><br>Author: Siriphong Lawphongpanich, Associate Professor, Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, PO Box 11-6595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, lawphong@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we consider nonnegative Pareto-improving toll vectors that improve the social benefit without making anyone worse off. Although such tolls are more likely to be accepted by the general public, they may not exist in all cases. Our focus is on establishing existence conditions when the travel demands are either fixed or elastic.</br>
