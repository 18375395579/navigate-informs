        <br>Title: Routing and Staffing to Incentivize Servers in Many-server Systems</br><br>Author: Amy Ward, Associate Professor, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, Bridge Hall 401H, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, amyward@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ragavendran Gopalakrishnan, Adam Wierman, Sherwin Doroudi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Traditionally, research focusing on the design of scheduling and staffing policies for service systems has modeled servers as having fixed (possibly heterogeneous) service rates. However, service systems are often staffed by people. Then, the rate a server chooses to work is impacted by the system’s scheduling and staffing policies. We consider the impact of “strategic servers?on system performance in many-server systems.  (There is a companion talk in the Applied Probability cluster.)</br>
