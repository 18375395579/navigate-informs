        <br>Title: Capacitated Facility Location Problems with Single Source Constraints and Flexible Customer Demand</br><br>Author: Chase Rainwater, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, crainwa@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Geunes, Edwin Romeijn</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a generalization of the capacitated facility location problem, where customers permit delivery quantity flexibility within specified ranges.  While the supplier’s revenue increases in delivery quantity (possibly as a nonlinear function of the quantity supplied), the resulting profit-maximization problem is complicated by capacity limits and supply cost structures.  We propose a branch-and-price algorithm, which leads to an interesting class of nonlinear knapsack pricing problems.</br>
