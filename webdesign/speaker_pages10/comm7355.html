        <br>Title: Approximation Algorithms for Stochastic Lot-sizing Inventory Control</br><br>Author: Cong Shi, Student, MIT Operations Research Center, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E40-135, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, shicong@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We develop an algorithmic approach to compute provably near-optimal policies for multiperiod stochastic lot-sizing inventory models with stochastic, non-stationary and correlated demands that evolve over time. The approach can be extended to serial network topology with fixed costs, for which very little is known about the optimal policies.</br>
