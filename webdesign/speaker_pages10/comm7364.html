        <br>Title: Mean and Variance Based Policies for a Partially Observed Zero-balance Walk Inventory Model</br><br>Author: Metin Cakanyildirim, School of Management, The University of Texas at Dallas, 2200 N Floyd Rd, Richardson, TX, United States of America, metin@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alain Bensoussan, Suresh Sethi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study a partially observed inventory system in which the demand is not observed, the inventory level is noticed when it reaches zero, the unmet demand is lost.  To minimize the total discounted costs, we provide approximations based on the mean/variance of the inventory level.  The approximation has a novel DP equation that resembles a mixture of equations of the fully and partially observed problems.  The mean/variance policy generalizes the policy of the fully observed problem.</br>
