        <br>Title: Optimal Prices and Production Rate in a Closed Loop Supply Chain under Heavy Traffic</br><br>Author: Sarah Ryan, Professor, Iowa State, Ames, IA, 50011, United States of America, smryan@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ananda Weerasinghe, Lizhi Wang, Arka Ghosh</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We analyze a simple queuing network model of a manufacturing and remanufacturing firm.  Long run average cost is minimized by setting the price ratio of remanufactured to new products to induce heavy traffic and then solving a diffusion control problem for the asymptotically optimal production rate.  A similar analysis applies to minimizing infinite horizon discounted cost. Numerical results show how various parameters affect the optimal decisions.</br>
