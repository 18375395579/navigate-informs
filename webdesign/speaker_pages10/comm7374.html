        <br>Title: Asymptotic Stability of AR(1)-Driven Workforce Scheduling Models</br><br>Author: Yong-Pin Zhou, Associate Professor, University of Washington and University of Hong Kong, Box 353226, Seattle, WA, 98195-3226, United States of America, yongpin@u.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Noah Gans, Haipeng Shen, Han Ye</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We determine workforce schedules for call center arrivals that are doubly stochastic. Period-by-period arrival rates follow a hidden AR(1) process, and only arrival counts are observed.  We formulate stochastic programs to minimize long-run average staffing costs, subject to a long-run average constraint on abandonment.  We show that, in steady state, repeated, myopic solution of the single-period problem is stable, has low cost, and meets the abandonment constraint.</br>
