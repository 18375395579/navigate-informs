        <br>Title: Bayesian Analysis of Markov Modulated Queues</br><br>Author: Refik Soyer, Professor of Decision Sciences & Statistics, The George Washington University, 2201 G Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, soyer@gwu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Suleyman Ozekici, Joshua Landon</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a Markovian queueing model where both customer arrival process and the service process are modulated by an external environmental process. We present the Bayesian analysis  of the stochastic system. We illustrate   the implementation of our model and the Bayesian approach by using  queueing data.</br>
