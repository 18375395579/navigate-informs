        <br>Title: Cross-training of Team Members to Deal with Demand Mix Variation and Absenteeism</br><br>Author: Jordi Olivella, Assistant Professor, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Esteve Terradas, 7, Castelldefels, 08860, Spain, jorge.olivella@upc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Nembhard</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The objectives of this work are: (1) To develop a method to determine the cross-training goals of a work team in order to deal with certain levels of variation in the demand mix and absenteeism; and (2) Evaluating alternative policies of cross-training of team members. The demand mix variation is defined by establishing a maximum time to devote to each product. To solve numerically the mathematical problem generated a selection constraint based procedure is developed.</br>
