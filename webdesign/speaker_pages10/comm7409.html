        <br>Title: The Multi-location Transshipment Problem with Positive Replenishment Lead Times</br><br>Author: Enver Yucesan, Professor, INSEAD, Technology and Operations Management Are, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, Enver.Yucesan@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yeming Gong</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Transshipments, monitored movements of material at the same echelon of a supply chain, represent an effective pooling mechanism.  Earlier papers dealing with transshipments either do not typically incorporate replenishment lead times into their analysis. This paper uses simulation optimization to examine the multi-location transshipment problem with positive replenishment lead times. It demonstrates the computation of optimal base stock quantities through sample path optimization.</br>
