        <br>Title: Decentralized Approximate Dynamic Programming and Resource Allocation for Dynamic Networks of Agents</br><br>Author: Daniela Pucci de Farias, pucci@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hariharan Lakshmanan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider stochastic control systems involving teams of agents communicating through a network with dynamic topology. We propose a decentralized approximate dynamic programming scheme and show that it can be viewed as a resource allocation problem. Motivated by this observation, we develop a fully decentralized and asynchronous algorithm for a general class of resource allocation problems that is provably convergent under mild assumptions on the structure of communication among agents.</br>
