        <br>Title: A Special Hybrid Flowhsop Scheduling Problem with No Buffer</br><br>Author: Esaignani Selvarajah, Assistant Professor, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, On, Canada, selvare@uwindsor.ca</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study job sequencing in a special hybrid flowshop when there is  no buffer. The problem is NP-hard.  Therefore,  we  first study the two stage hybrid flowshop problem. Then we provide a mathematical model and a heuristic  algorithm for the  multi-stage m-machine problem.</br>
