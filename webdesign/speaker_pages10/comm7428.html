        <br>Title: Integrated Production Planning and Pricing with Congestion-Prone Production Resources</br><br>Author: Reha Uzsoy, Professor, Purdue University, 315 N. Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States, uzsoy@ecn.purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abhijit Upasani</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We present an integrated production planning and pricing model where demand is determined by both price and lead time, and production resources are subject to congestion. We examine the relationship between lead times, prices and demand characteristics and provide numerical examples comparing the results to those from a fixed lead time model that does not capture the relationship between resource loading and lead times.</br>
