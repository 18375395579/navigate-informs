        <br>Title: A Stochastic Framework for Modelling Material Handlig Activities</br><br>Author: Kai Furmans, Universitaet Karlsruhe (TH), Kaiserstr. 12, Karlsruhe, 76131, Germany, kai.furmans@ifl.uni-karlsruhe.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc Schleyer</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Warehousing activities are subject to a lot of stochastic influences. The system load is usually dependent on customer behaviour, resulting in changing quantities and structure of orders and tasks. When humans are involved, the time needed to perform those tasks is varying.   We present a framework of stochastic elements, that by combining these elements, allows a fast modelling and calculation of percentiles of throughput time distributions, taking the above mentioned issues into account.</br>
