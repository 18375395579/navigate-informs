        <br>Title: Heavy Traffic Approximations for EDF Queues with Reneging</br><br>Author: Kavita Ramanan, Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Mathematical Sciences, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, kramanan@math.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Haya Kaspi, Weining Kang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The performance of a real-time queueing system is measure by its ability to meet the deadlines of the customers.  Common examples of such systems include telecommunication systems carrying digitized voice or video traffic, tracking systems and real-time control systems.  For such systems, the Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) scheduling discipline has been shown to enjoy many optimality properties.  In this  work, we establish heavy-traffic approximations for the EDF discipline in the case when late customers are not served. In the process, we will discuss the role of certain mappings, which can be viewed as a generalization to the measure-valued setting of the reflection map.  The talk is based on joint work with John Lehoczky, Lukasz Kruk and Steven Shreve.</br>
