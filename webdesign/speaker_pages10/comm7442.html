        <br>Title: A Decomposition Algorithm for a Chance-constrained Program with Recourse</br><br>Author: Xiao Liu, Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH, United States of America, liu.2738@buckeyemail.osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Simge Küçükyavuz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a class of two-stage stochastic optimization problems. In the first stage, a set of decisions must be made before random parameters, with finite support, are revealed. In the second stage, after the realization of uncertain parameters, recourse decisions are made at an additional cost such that a certain service level is met with high probability. We propose a finite decomposition algorithm for this class of problems, and report our computational experiments with it.</br>
