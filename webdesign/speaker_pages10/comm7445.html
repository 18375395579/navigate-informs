        <br>Title: Stock-out Risk Control of the Production-Inventory System with Compound Poisson Demands</br><br>Author: Jim Shi, Georgia State University, College of Business, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, shigsu@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a single-product continuous-time  production-inventory system with a constant replenishment rate,  compound Poisson demands and lost-sales. The objective  is first to derive the expected discounted inventory cost until the  stockout occurrence for any given initial inventory level so as to investigate the stockout risk.</br>
