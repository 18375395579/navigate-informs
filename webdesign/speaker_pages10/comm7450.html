        <br>Title: Optimal Control of a Flexible Server in an Assembly System with Setups</br><br>Author: Nilay Argon, University of North Carolina, 205 Smith Building CB#3260, Chapel Hill, NC, United States, nilay@unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yi-Chun Tsai</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider an assembly system with a single flexible server, multiple feeder stations, and an instantaneous assembly operation. For such a system, we are interested in the optimal control of the server with the objective of minimizing the long-run average holding and setup costs. We provide several sets of conditions under which we can characterize the optimal policy.</br>
