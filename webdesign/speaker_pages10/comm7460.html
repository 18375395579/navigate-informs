        <br>Title: Impact of Delay Announcements in Call Centers: An Empirical Approach</br><br>Author: Seyed Emadi, Assistant Professor, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Kenan-Flagler Business School, 300 Kenan Dr, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, s-emadi@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zeynep Aksin Karaesmen, Baris Ata, Che-Lin Su</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We undertake an empirical study of the impact of delay announcements on callers' abandonment behavior and the performance of a call center with two priority classes. We develop a methodological framework to find the steady-state equilibrium by combining the estimation of callers reward and cost parameters, the model of callers' abandonment behavior and the queuing analysis that incorporates this behavior.</br>
