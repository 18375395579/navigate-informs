        <br>Title: A DEA-Based Approach for Sorting Alternatives</br><br>Author: Murat Köksalan, Professor, Middle East Technical University, Industrial Engineering, Ankara, 06531, Turkey, koksalan@ie.metu.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ceren Tuncer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the sorting problem of classifying alternatives defined by multiple criteria into different preference classes. As the number of classes increase, the sorting problem approaches a ranking problem. We develop a DEA-based approach using weight restrictions on inputs and outputs. To determine the class of an alternative, we consider how the efficiency score of an alternative changes as we remove the alternatives affecting its efficiency score.</br>
