        <br>Title: Robust Scheduling for Flexible Queueing Networks</br><br>Author: Yuan Zhong, Columbia University, 560 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, zhyu4118@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jean Walrand, Ramtin Pedarsani</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider a general flexible queueing network with servers of overlapping capabilities, which include parallel server systems and open multiclass queueing networks. A scheduling policy decides how server capacities are allocated over time, and it is robust if it does not use knowledge of network parameters. We propose a gradient-descent like robust scheduling policy for general flexible networks, and discuss its convergence and delay properties. In addition, we also provide simulation results.</br>
