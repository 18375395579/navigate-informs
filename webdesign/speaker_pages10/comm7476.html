        <br>Title: Demand Uncertainty and Optimal Decision Making for the Newsvendor Problem</br><br>Author: Peter Kischka, Professor, University Jena, Carl Zeiss Strasse 3, Jena, 07743, Germany, p.kischka@wiwi.uni-jena.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Werner Jammernegg</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a set of possible demand distributions and a prior distribution for this set. Based on the predictive distribution of demand induced by the prior we introduce a mean deviation rule to incorporate the degree of uncertainty implied by an order quantity. We analyze the dependence of the optimal order quantity on the prior distribution as well as on the price and cost variables of the newsvendor model.</br>
