        <br>Title: On the Dynamic Control of Matching Queues</br><br>Author: Itai Gurvich, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL, United States of America, i-gurvich@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Amy Ward</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the optimal control of matching queues with dynamically arriving jobs. The objective is to minimize cumulative holding costs over a finite time horizon. We introduce a multi-dimensional imbalance process that facilitates the construction of a lower bound. Imposing a match-pooling condition, we devise a discrete-review dynamic matching policy that asymptotically, as the arrival rates become large, achieves this imbalance-based lower bound.</br>
