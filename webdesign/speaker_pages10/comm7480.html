        <br>Title: Cellular Bucket Brigades</br><br>Author: Yun Fong Lim, Assistant Professor, Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, 50 Stamford Rd, #04-01, Singapore, 178899, Singapore, yflim@smu.edu.sg</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Workers in a bucket brigade production line perform unproductive travel when they walk to get new work from their colleagues. Excessive unproductive travel could hurt the throughput of the line significantly. We propose a new design of bucket brigade production lines in which this unproductive travel is reduced and so a higher level of throughput can be attained with fewer and slower workers.</br>
