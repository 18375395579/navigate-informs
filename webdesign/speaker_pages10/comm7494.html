        <br>Title: Cycle Time Constrained Priority Mix Optimization Based on Decomposition Approximation Model</br><br>Author: Shi-Chung Chang, Professor, National Taiwan University, Rm. 245, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan - ROC, scchang@cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shin-Shyu Su, Yu-ting Kao, Bo-Jiun Liao</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We optimize the priority mix of semiconductor manufacturing under cycle-time target constraints.  It is built on top of a novel, hybrid decomposition-approximation-based priority queueing network for quick evaluation of cycle-times under given priority mix, price, and capacity utilizations. Comparisons with simulation models for applications to supply chain management are performed.</br>
