        <br>Title: Service-Level Distribution of Multi-Server Queues</br><br>Author: Sandjai Bhulai, VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Sciences, De Boelelaan 1081a, Amsterdam, 1081HV, Netherlands, s.bhulai@vu.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alex Roubos, Rene Bekker</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many service levels are expressed as fractions of customers who are waiting at most some threshold value. A steady-state analysis provides the long-run average service level, but neglects the variations on shorter time scales. In this paper we obtain the distribution of the service level after a finite time. We study a time-average equivalent using Levy processes. We illustrate these results by applying the techniques to a call routing problem in a multi-site call center setting.</br>
