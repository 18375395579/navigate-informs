        <br>Title: Decentralized Load Balancing</br><br>Author: Marco Bijvank, VU University Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1081a, Amsterdam, -, 1081 HV, Netherlands, mbijvank@few.vu.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vivek Rai, Wemke van der Weij</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Current IT services are built using three tier architectures where requests arriving at web servers are routed to application servers that are further routed to a database. A load balancer is required to route these requests to the application servers. The objective is to design decentralized load balancing algorithms based on partial load information such as power of two choices, thresholding based algorithms, and age based server selection. We use an MDP formulation for our analysis.</br>
