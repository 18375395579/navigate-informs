        <br>Title: Optimal Network Scheduling Algorithms</br><br>Author: Devavrat Shah, Assistant Professor, MIT, 32-D670, 77 Massachussets Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, devavrat@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Damon Wischik</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider question of designing scheduling algorithm for a queueing network in which there are constraints on which queues may be served simultaneously, e.g. wireless networks, switch or bandwidth sharing in the Internet. Using critically loaded fluid model, we obtain insight into designing optimal scheduling algorithm related to the maximum-weight algorithm of Tassiulas-Ephremides (1992).</br>
