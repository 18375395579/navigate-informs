        <br>Title: Allocation of Jobs and Resources to Pooling Centers</br><br>Author: Hui-Chih Hung, Post-Doctoral Researcher, Ohio State University, 1971 Neil Avenue, Department of Industrial Engineering, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States, hung.63@osu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marc Posner</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We partition identical and non-identical servers into parallel pooling centers and simultaneously assign job types to centers. Each job type has a distinct Poisson arrival rate and WIP weight. The goal is to minimize the total WIP cost. Heuristics are developed and are evaluated both theoretically and experimentally.</br>
