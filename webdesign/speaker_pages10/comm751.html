        <br>Title: Distributionally Robust Inventory Control when Demand is a Martingale</br><br>Author: Linwei Xin, PhD Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, lwxin@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David A. Goldberg</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In multi period inventory models, independence of random demands across different periods is a typical assumption in the literature. In this talk, we consider a distributionally robust inventory model in which the sequence of demands must take the form of a martingale with bounded support. We explicitly compute the optimal policy and draw some interesting conclusions about how much the independence and martingale assumptions can differ in terms of optimal value and policy.</br>
