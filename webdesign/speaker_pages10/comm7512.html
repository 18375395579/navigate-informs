        <br>Title: Customer Acquisition, Retention, and Service Quality in a Call Center</br><br>Author: Philipp Afeche, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, philipp.afeche@rotman.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mojtaba Araghi, Opher Baron</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing the profit of an inbound call center that controls promotions, staffing, and priorities to new vs. base customers. We develop a deterministic fluid model that links these controls to customer flows, the size of the customer base and key performance measures. We generate analytical prescriptions on the optimal decisions for the fluid model, compare these to simulation results, and discuss the sensitivity to word-of-mouth effects and customer characteristics.</br>
