        <br>Title: Randomization Approaches for Network RM with Choice Behavior</br><br>Author: Sumit Kunnumkal, Assistant Professor, Indian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, A.P, AP, India, sumit_kunnumkal@isb.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present new approximation methods for the network RM  problem with customer choice behavior. The starting point for our methods is a dynamic program that allows randomization. An attractive feature of this dynamic program is that the size of its action space is linear in the number of itineraries.  We present two approximation methods that build on this dynamic program and use ideas from the independent  demands setting.</br>
