        <br>Title: Convergence of  Nash Dynamics to Approximate Solutions</br><br>Author: Vahab Mirrkoni, Researcher, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, United States, mirrokni@microsoft.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: I will survey recent results on convergence to approximate solutions in games.  For potential games, we study the speed of convergence of $\alpha$-Nash dynamics to efficient solutions.  I show a polynomial upper bound of the convergence of this dynamics in congestion games with approximation ratio that is arbitrarily close to the price of anarchy of the game. For non-potential games, I will define sink equilibria and survey results about convergence time of random Nash dynamics.</br>
