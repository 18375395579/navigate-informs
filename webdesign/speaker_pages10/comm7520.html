        <br>Title: Solution Methods for the Generalized Assignment Problem with Flexible Jobs</br><br>Author: Chase Rainwater, Research Assistant, Industrial and Systems Engineering Department - University of Florida, 450 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, crainwa@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Geunes, H. Edwin Romeijn</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a profit-maximizing version of the generalized assignment problem with flexible job requirements. That is, there is a range of acceptable requirement levels for each candidate assignment and the chosen level affects the job revenue in a linear way. We consider an exact branch-and-price algorithm approach and propose a greedy heuristic that we analyze under a probabilistic model.</br>
