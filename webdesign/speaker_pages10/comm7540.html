        <br>Title: Sourcing Decisions in the Presence of Yield and Demand Uncertainties</br><br>Author: Jian Li, Assistant Professor, Department of Management & Marketing, Northeastern Illinois University, 5500 N. St. Louis Ave, Chicago, IL, 60625, United States of America, jli@neiu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Panos Kouvelis</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we look at the sourcing decisions at one facility facing yield and demand uncertainties over a finite discrete-time horizon from the perspective of an inventory manager. We propose and model two systems: Ante-Delivery Ensuring system (ADES) and Post-Delivery Ensuring system (PDES). For each developed model, we characterize theoretically the optimal decisions, and derive sensitivity results on how these decisions are affected by one another and the yield and demand uncertainties.</br>
