        <br>Title: Robust Dynamic Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Itir Karaesmen, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States of America, ikaraes@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Ball, Huina Gao</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the multi-fare, single-leg revenue management problem under limited demand information.  Demand in each fare class lies between lower and upper bounds that can be time-variant; no other assumptions are made on arrivals or probability distributions of demand. We analyze this problem using competitive analysis of online algorithms. We provide efficient heuristic methods to obtain booking limits. Computational experiments reveal the benefit of dynamic decision-making.</br>
