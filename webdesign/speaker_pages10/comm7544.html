        <br>Title: Toward a “Standard Model?of Supply Chain Dynamics</br><br>Author: Mark Spearman, President, Factory Physics, Inc., 3600 E 29th Street, Bryan, TX, 77802, United States of America, spearman@factoryphysics.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The “Standard Model?of particle physics along with the “principle of least action?forms the basis for almost all fundamental physics.  Application of this principle to the supply chain naturally results in a Brownian Motion model that leads to a supply chain “uncertainty principle?relating net inventory and production.  The model also provides an easy means to determine the stationary distributions of net inventory and net flow as well as suggesting new ways to control production.</br>
