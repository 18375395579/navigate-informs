        <br>Title: Approximation Algorithms for Two-Stage Stochastic and Robust Combinatorial Optimization Problems</br><br>Author: Vineet Goyal, PhD Student, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, vgoyal@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider two stage combinatorial optimization problems where the goal is to construct a partial first stage solution knowing the possible second stage scenarios and complete it in the second stage after one of the scenarios realizes s.t. the expected (worst case) cost is minimized. In particular, we consider min-cut problem on an undirected graph in this model (a root vertex is given but the terminal is uncertain) and give approximation algorithms to minimize the expected and worst case costs</br>
