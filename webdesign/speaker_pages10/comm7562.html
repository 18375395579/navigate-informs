        <br>Title: Stochastic Optimization for Resource Allocation with Random Emergencies</br><br>Author: Joline Uichanco, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, uichanco@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mallik Angalakudati, Siddharth Balwani, Jorge Calzada, Georgia Perakis, Nicolas Raad</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling jobs to resources, assuming a random number of emergency jobs arrive in the future.  We model the problem using stochastic optimization.  We propose decomposition techniques and heuristics, for which we prove analytic performance guarantees. We apply these to a major US gas utility company to schedule its services.  Using actual data, we show that our model reduces overtime by 65%. The company is currently piloting a web-based planning tool using our models.</br>
