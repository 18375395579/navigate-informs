        <br>Title: Strategic Idling in a Job-shop Queueing Healthcare Network - Analysis and Justification</br><br>Author: Jianfu (Jeff) Wang, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, Jianfu.Wang08@Rotman.Utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oded Berman, Opher Baron, Dmitry Krass</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this study, we helped a company with a jobshop network to improve customers?service experience. The company has two major service level measures (SLM): 1) the total system time and 2) the probability of waiting more than 20 minutes for any stations. These two SLMs contradict each other: non-idle policies are intuitively good for SLM1, while the data shows that the company often idles servers for SLM2. Using simulation, we showed that idling policies can reduce SLM2 but not damage SLM1 much.</br>
