        <br>Title: An Alternative to Clark and Scarf’s Balance Assumption for Inventory Distribution Systems</br><br>Author: Sumit Kunnumkal, Indian School of Business, AC 4, Level 1, 4116, Hyderabad, AP, India, sumit_kunnumkal@isb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Huseyin Topaloglu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present a new method to make the inventory replenishment decisions in a distribution system consisting of multiple retailers  and a single warehouse. Our method is based on relaxing the constraints that ensure the nonnegativity of  the shipments to the retailers by associating Lagrange multipliers with them. Numerical studies show that our method can provide significant improvements over traditional methods when the balance assumption of Clark and Scarf (1960) is not satisfactory.</br>
