        <br>Title: Distributed Resource Allocation for Fork and Join</br><br>Author: Cathy Xia, Associate Professor, The Ohio State University, Dept. of Industrial & System Engineering, Columbus, OH, 43210, United States of America, cathyhxia@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chuck Zhao, Zhen Liu, Don Towsley</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Many emerging information processing applications require applying various fork and join type operations to data streams in real-time. Effective in-network processing and resource management in a distributed heterogeneous environment is critical to achieve better scalability and quality of service provision.  We present novel  distributed resource allocation algorithms that achieve the global optimality in a generic fork and join network setting.</br>
