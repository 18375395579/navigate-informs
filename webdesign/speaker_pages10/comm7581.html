        <br>Title: Strategic Safety Stocks in Supply Chains with Evolving Forecasts</br><br>Author: Stephen Graves, Professor, Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Mass Ave, E53-347, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, sgraves@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tor Schoenmeyr</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine safety stock placement in a supply chain with an evolving forecast of demand.  We show that safety stock placement for such systems is equivalent to the corresponding well-studied problem for supply chains with stationary demand and base stock policies. We can thus use existing algorithms to find the optimal safety stocks. We use a case study with real data to demonstrate the significant benefits from the inclusion of the forecast process when determining the optimal safety stocks.</br>
