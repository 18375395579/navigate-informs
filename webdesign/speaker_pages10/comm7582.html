        <br>Title: Manufacturing Line Design for Product Variety Considering Line Flexibility and Task Similarity</br><br>Author: Jeonghan Ko, University of Michigan, 2350 HAYWARD ST., 2250 G.G. BROWN, Mechanical Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, jeonghan@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jack Hu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Classical approaches to manufacturing line design have usually concerned serial configurations of identical machines. We developed mixed integer programming models for maximizing (1) cost-effectiveness of line configurations for multiple product models by the appropriate combinations of dedicated and flexible machines, and (2) the similarity of manufacturing tasks assigned to a machine for different product models.</br>
