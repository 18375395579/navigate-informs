        <br>Title: Optimal Fare Differentiation in Airline Industry with Demand Leakages</br><br>Author: Syed Asif Raza, Assistant Professor, Qatar University, College of Business and Economics, Doha, 2713, Qatar, syedar@qu.edu.qa</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This research addresses the issue of establishing an integrated framework to optimize the fare pricing, and  seat inventory control for an airline that experiences the demand leakage in its fare classes. Models are proposed for an airline that experiences  deterministic demand, stochastic demand, and stochastic demand whose distribution is unknown. These models are analyzed to outline an integrated optimal control framework for fare pricing, seat inventory control decisions for an airline.</br>
