        <br>Title: Scheduling Preventive Maintenance as a Function of an Imperfect Inspection Interval</br><br>Author: Kai He, Ph.D. student, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, sjtu.hekai@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Maillart, Oleg Prokopyev</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present an imperfect inspection and preventive maintenance (PM) model for a system subject to hidden failures. Inspections occur at fixed intervals and detect failures with a known probability. PM renews the system at failure detection or at a scheduled time. The objective is to schedule PM as a function of the inspection interval to minimize the expected long-run cost rate. Analytical and numerical results illustrate conditions that ensure the existence of an optimal solution.</br>
