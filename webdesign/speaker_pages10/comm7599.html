        <br>Title: Joining Longer Queues: Information Externalities in Queue Choice</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut Street, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A classic example that illustrates how observed customer behavior impacts other customers' decisions is the selection of a restaurant whose quality is uncertain. Customers often choose the busier restaurant, inferring that other customers in that restaurant know something that they do not. Queue lengths could signal two factors - potentially higher arrivals, or slower service at the server. We study the effect of both arrival and service rates on the inference made by an arriving customer.</br>
