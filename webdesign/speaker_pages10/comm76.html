        <br>Title: Dynamic Allocation of Flexible Resources to Market Differentiated Stochastic Demand</br><br>Author: Eylem Tekin, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, Industrial Engineering, College Station, TX, 77843, United States, eylem@iemail.tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tao Huang</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a network of multiple flexible resources with fixed initial capacities that are used to satisfy demands from different market segments during a finite planning horizon.  Using a dynamic programming approach, we show the structural properties of the optimal allocation policy for a two-resource case. For more general cases, we propose heuristic approaches derived from these structural properties.</br>
