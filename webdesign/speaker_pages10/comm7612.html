        <br>Title: Non-FCFS Scheduling in Fluid Many-server Queues</br><br>Author: Petar Momcilovic, Associate Professor, University of Florida, 303 Weil Hall, P.O. Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States of America, petar@ise.ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Avishai Mandelbaum</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider non-FCFS scheduling policies in many-server fluid queues. In particular, we examine time-varying queues under the assumption that the scheduler knows realizations of customer patience/service times. Implementing a non-FCFS policy improves the overall system performance in terms of the number of customers that abandon during overloaded periods.</br>
