        <br>Title: Demand Uncertainty and Dynamic Pricing of IT Services</br><br>Author: Parijat Dube, IBM Research, 19 Skyline Drive, Hawthorne, NY, 10532, United States, pdube@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cathy Xia</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of dynamic pricing of IT services as an expected utility maximization problem under demand uncertainty.  Demand is characterized using probabilistic models based on service provider's prior beliefs, which are improved along the process. Pricing decisions are then obtained dynamically, where the service provider chooses the measure that minimizes the relative entropy with the true model.</br>
