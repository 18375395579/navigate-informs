        <br>Title: Dynamic Routing Policies for Multi-skill Call Centers</br><br>Author: Sandjai Bhulai, VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Sciences, De Boelelaan 1081a, Amsterdam, 1081 HV, Netherlands, sbhulai@few.vu.nl</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a multi-skill call center to which calls from different skill classes are offered and need to be routed to agents that are grouped according to their heterogeneous skill sets. We study both the scenario with call pooling and with blocking when no agent is available. We obtain nearly optimal dynamic routing policies that are scalable with the problem instance and can be computed online. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these routing policies have very good performance.</br>
