        <br>Title: Dynamic Cruise Ship Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Bacel Maddah, American University of Beirut, School of Engineering, PO Box 11-0236, Beirut, 1107-2020, Lebanon, bm05@aub.edu.lb</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lama Moussawi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper analyzes a two-dimensional cruise ship revenue management problem, where customers arrive in groups and request one cabin of a particular category and a number of lifeboat seats. Accepting a family on board requires two resources: Cabins and lifeboat seats. The decision is to accept/reject a request. We formulate this problem as a discrete time dynamic program. We propose several heuritics, compare their performance and make recommendations.</br>
