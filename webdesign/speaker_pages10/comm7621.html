        <br>Title: Inspection Policies under Delay Times and Postponed Replacements</br><br>Author: C.D van Oosterom, PhD student, Eindhoven University of Technology, P.O. Box 513, Opwettensemolen 62, Eindhoven, 5600MB, Netherlands, C.D.v.Oosterom@tue.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Geert-Jan van Houtum, Alaa Elwany, Dilay Çelebi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop a delay time model for a single-component system under a novel assumption: postponed replacement. If an inspection reveals a defect, we allow replacement to be postponed to provide a larger time window to prepare maintenance resources and increase utilization of the system’s useful life. We derive the optimal policy for a system with exponentially distributed defect arrival time and deterministic delay time. By a numerical case study we evaluate the benefits of postponement.</br>
