        <br>Title: Operations Scheduling Problems with Renewable and Non-renewable Resources</br><br>Author: Shengbin Wang, North Carolina A&T State University, 1601 East Market Street, Greensboro, NC, 27411, United States of America, swang@ncat.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lei Lei</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider an operations scheduling problem that is constrained by both renewable and non-renewable resources. Each operation requires a specified amount of non-renewable resources released over the time, and a deadline for the completion time. Availability of the renewable resources depends on the sequence of the operations. An approximation solution to minimize the total tardiness is proposed and analyzed.</br>
