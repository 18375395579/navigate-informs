        <br>Title: Supply Chain Management with Online Customer Selection</br><br>Author: Adam Elmachtoub, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, ane@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a general class of supply chain and logistics problems where customers arrive sequentially, and one has to decide upon arrival whether to accept or reject each customer. The goal is to minimize the total production costs for the accepted customers plus the rejection costs for the rejected customers. We provide several online algorithms for these problems that are provably near optimal. Our algorithms are based on novel uses of re-optimization and cooperative game theory techniques.</br>
