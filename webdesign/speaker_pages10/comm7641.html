        <br>Title: Period Vehicle Routing with Stochastic Service Requests</br><br>Author: Luis de la Torre, PhD Candidate, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, C210, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, ledelatorre@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Irina Dolinskaya, Karen Smilowitz</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We introduce and study models and operational policies for a probabilistic period vehicle routing problem with two customer types.  Regular customers require repeated service over a time horizon, while special customers have a probability of requesting service during the horizon. We present a two-stage model to minimize expected routing costs while maintaining customer consistency; routes are created before demand realizations and special customers are re-optimized after demand realizations.</br>
