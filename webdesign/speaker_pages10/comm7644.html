        <br>Title: Fair Allocation Over Time</br><br>Author: Stergios Athanassoglou, PhD Student, Columbia University, IEOR Department, 500 West 120th Street, Room 313 Mudd Building, New York, NY, 10027, United States, sa2164@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jay Sethuraman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating a divisible resource over a fixed time horizon. We assume a continuum of agents, competing for the same infinitesimal fraction of the resource in each period. An agent decides to demand the resource after observing his utility for the resource. In the interest of fairness, priority classes are determined by the number of times an agent has chosen to participate in the past. We describe the equilibrium of this game and ways to compute it in special cases.</br>
