        <br>Title: Call Center Staffing: Service-level-Differentiation and G-c?Rules</br><br>Author: Seung Bum Soh, Doctoral Student, Northwestern University, 2001 Sheridan Road, Evanston, United States of America, seung-soh@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Itai Gurvich</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The prevalence of generalized c-mu rules sheds some light into characteristics of prioritization rules that are considered as desirable. One property of these rules is that they globally differentiate between classes at all time -- a VIP customer waits more than a regular customer who arrives at the same time. In this work we show that when solving staffing problems subject to Quality-of-service constraints, generalized c-mu and global differentiation are in important ways equivalent.</br>
