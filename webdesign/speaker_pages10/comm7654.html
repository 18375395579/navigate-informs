        <br>Title: Design Analysis of a New Class of Order-Picking Systems</br><br>Author: Margarit Khachatryan, Graduate Research Assistant, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive, NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States, magakh@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leon McGinnis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a formal model for the design analysis of a new class of order-picking systems: small parts high volume order picking with pick-to-buffer. Viewing the process as two stages, order picking and order assembly, leads to a tandem queuing model of performance. Analyzing the model requires new results for both picker travel time, the estimation of the squared coefficient of variation for departures from a queue with batch arrivals and model for the second stage: order assembly.</br>
