        <br>Title: Bayesian Inventory Management with Potential Change-points in Demand</br><br>Author: Zhe Wang, UNC Chapel Hill, CB 3490, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, zhe_wang@unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Adam Mersereau</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider an adaptive inventory control problem in which at some known potential change-points, the demand process may change abruptly with some probability. The underlying demand process is never revealed to the decision maker. Using a Bayesian framework, we analyze the optimal policy as demands are observed. We construct two novel lower bounds which are used to develop two heuristics and to numerically evaluate their performance.</br>
