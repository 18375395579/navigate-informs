        <br>Title: Structured Maintenance Policies on Interior Sample Paths</br><br>Author: Lisa Maillart, Assistant Professor, University of Pittsburgh, lisa.maillart@case.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ludmila Zheltova</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We examine the problem of adaptively scheduling perfect observations and preventive replacements for a multi-state, Markovian deterioration system with silent failures such that total expected discounted cost is minimized. We contribute to the existing literature which models this problem as a partially observed Markov decision process by extending the at-most-four-region structure of the optimal policy to non-extreme sample paths.</br>
