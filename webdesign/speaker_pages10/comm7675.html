        <br>Title: A Periodic Review Modeling Approach for Guaranteed Service Supply Chains</br><br>Author: John M. Bossert, Senior Research Scientist, Optiant, 4 van de Graaff Drive, Burlington, MA, 01803, United States, john.bossert@optiant.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sean Willems</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We extend the guaranteed service supply chain modeling framework to allow for an arbitrary integer review period or ordering frequency at each stage. We accommodate three different periodic review operating policies - constant base stock, constant safety stock, and adaptive base stock. We apply the model to real-world data and show that inventory metrics of the new model differ by more than 30% from those derived through the simpler modeling approach of aggregating a review period into leadtime.</br>
