        <br>Title: Setting Inventory Targets for Multiple Products with Joint Service Levels and Correlated Demands</br><br>Author: Sridhar Tayur, SmartOps, 12 Federal Street, Suite 400, Pittsburgh, PA, 15212, United States, stayur@smartops.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bahar Biller</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We introduce a novel comprehensive simulation-based framework for setting good inventory targets to achieve a joint service level (such as purchase order fill rate, or dollar fill rate) in a discrete time, finite horizon model where the product demands are correlated in any period, and demands of any product are correlated across time. Our solutions are close to best possible within classes of policies that APS systems can recognize.</br>
