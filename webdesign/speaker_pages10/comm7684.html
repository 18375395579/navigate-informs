        <br>Title: Multi-Stage Assembly Systems with Multiple Demand Classes and Phase-Type Assembly Times</br><br>Author: Mohsen ElHafsi, A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management, University of Califiornia, Riverside, CA, 92521, United States of America, mohsen.elhafsi@ucr.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Saif Benjaafar</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a general assembly system with multiple stages, multiple customer classes, compound demand, and production times characterized by a phase-type distribution. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and evaluate the performance of the optimal policy against the performance of common heuristics.</br>
