        <br>Title: Sequence-Dependent Group Scheduling in Hybrid Flowshops</br><br>Author: Mir Abbas Bozorgirad, PhD Student, Oregon State University, School of Mech, Indust, and Mfgr Engr., 204 Rogers Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331-6001, United States of America, bozorgim@onid.orst.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): R. Logen Logendran</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop tabu search based algorithms to address a bi-criteria group scheduling problem in hybrid flowshops with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of total weighted completion time and total weighted tardiness. There is a sequence-dependent setup time between different groups, and the job release times and machine availability times are considered to be dynamic. The performances of algorithms are evaluated and compared to each other to find the best algorithm for this problem.</br>
