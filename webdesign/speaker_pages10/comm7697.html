        <br>Title: Coordination in a Two-stage Production System: Complexity, Conflict and Cooperation</br><br>Author: Manoj Vanajakumari, Prairie View A & M University, Prairie View, TX, United States of America, manojuv@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chelliah Sriskandarajah, Edouard Wagneur</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study conflict and cooperation issues in a two-stage production system. The first stage is to minimize the sum of the completion times of jobs, and the second stage is to minimize the number of late jobs.  If required, jobs are re-sequenced to enhance the performance at a cost. We show that the coordination problem is strongly NP-Hard. Computational studies reveal the benefits of coordination, positive surplus with coordination, and significant conflict at the stages without coordination.</br>
