        <br>Title: Sequential Scheduling under General Service Time for Outpatient Clinics</br><br>Author: Santanu Chakraborty, Purdue University, 203 Martin Jischke Drive, Mann Hall, Suite 225, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, chakrabs@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Lawley, Kumar Muthuraman</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we develop a sequential scheduling algorithm under general service time where each patient is characterized by a certain probability of no-show. We show that the expected profit is unimodal which provides the necessary stopping rule. Also, we present an analysis for gamma service time.</br>
