        <br>Title: Route Designs for Delivery of Optical Scan Voting Machines</br><br>Author: Michael Fu, Professor, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, mfu@umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The 2002 Help America Vote Act required election boards to move to electronic voting by 2006. This change greatly increases the operational complexities of administering elections. We describe our work with Hamilton County, Ohio, to (1) solve a vehicle routing problem with time windows problem to deliver optical scanning voting machines; and (2) modify the means in which poll workers choose machine delivery times in order to gain greater flexibility in our solutions.</br>
