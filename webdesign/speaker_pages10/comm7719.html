        <br>Title: Workforce Capacity Planning for Systems with Discontinuous Workflows and Highly Variable Job Sizes</br><br>Author: Ana Radovanovic, IBM, Route 134, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, aradovan@us.ibm.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by emerging applications in workforce management, we consider a capacity planning problem where “usual?loss network or call center approach might not be appropriate for modeling and analysis.  We propose an analytic approach to address two novel features: only specific tasks in job processing are executed by an observed workforce team member, and task durations are subexponentially distributed. Our theoretically obtained capacities match surprisingly well real system simulations.</br>
