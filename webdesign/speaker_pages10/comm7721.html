        <br>Title: Staffing to Maximize Revenues with Alternate Service Level Agreements</br><br>Author: Joseph Milner, Professor, milner@rotman.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Opher Baron</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We determine the profit maximizing staffing policy for alternate service level agreements for an outsourced call center operating in an environment with uncertain demand and abandonment. In a new heavy traffic regime, we approximate the probability of abandonment and of meeting a service level measured by the percentage of customers served within the acceptable delay. We compare staffing to maximize profits dependent on service failure penalties over alternate time periods and draw conclusions.</br>
