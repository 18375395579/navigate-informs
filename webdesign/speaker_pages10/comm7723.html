        <br>Title: Modeling, Analysis, and Improvement of Multi-product Manufacturing Systems</br><br>Author: Cong Zhao, University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States of America, czhao27@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jingshan Li</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This presentation analyzes the multi-product manufacturing systems consisting of unreliable exponential machines and finite buffers. In such systems, multiple product types are processed in a predetermined sequence with different speeds on all machines. Buffers have finite capacities, and are shared for all products. Analytical methods to analyze the system performance are developed. Bottleneck analysis is carried out to identify the machine or product that will lead to the largest improvement.</br>
