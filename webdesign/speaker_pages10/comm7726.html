        <br>Title: Solving the Bottleneck Model with General Distributions of Value of Time and Cost of Schedule Delay</br><br>Author: Yang Liu, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Civil Engineering,  Room A320, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, yangliu@u.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This paper studies deterministic departure-time equilibriums in the bottleneck model with users who differ in their valuation of travel time and punctual arrival. An algorithm is proposed to solve the problem with general distributions of value of time and cost of schedule delay. The uniqueness and the existence conditions of user equilibriums are explored.  Another algorithm s introduced to solve the system optima in which queuing delay is eliminated by a system optimum (SO) toll scheme.</br>
