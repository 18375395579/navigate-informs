        <br>Title: Linear Programming with Online Learning</br><br>Author: Tanya Levin, Assistant Professor, Queen's School of Business, 143 Union str., Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada, TLevin@business.queensu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuri Levin, Jeff McGill, Mikhail Nediak</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose online decision strategies for time-dependent sequences of linear programs which use no distributional and minimal geometric assumptions about the data. These strategies are obtained through Vovk's aggregating algorithm which combines recommendations from a given strategy pool. We establish an average performance bound for the resulting solution sequence.</br>
