        <br>Title: Dynamic Matching via Weighted Myopia with Application to Kidney Exchange</br><br>Author: John Dickerson, Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Dept, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, dickerson@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ariel Procaccia, Tuomas Sandholm</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose an approach to stochastic optimization that learns potentials of problem elements. Then, we run an offline algorithm at each time period, subtracting from the objective the potentials of the elements used up. Applied to kidney exchange, we analyze the power of potentials on vertices, edges, cycles, and the entire graph. Experimentally, by learning vertex potentials, we get better solution quality than the myopic practice and scale much better than sample-trajectory-based algorithms.</br>
