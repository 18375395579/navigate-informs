        <br>Title: Discrete-Time Economic Lot Scheduling Problem on Multiple, Non-Identical Machines</br><br>Author: Ramesh Bollapragada, Professor, College of Business, San Francisco State University, 1600 Holloway Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94132, United States, rameshb@sfsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Federico DellaCroce, Marco Ghirardi</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop a general discrete time dynamic demand model to solve the real time resource allocation,   lot-sizing, and scheduling in a multimachine environment. We consider the problem of apportioning item production   to distinct manufacturing lines with different costs and capabilities.  We will model the problem quantitatively, develop and   test several alternative solution methods, and build managerial insights on problem parameters from computational   experimentation.</br>
