        <br>Title: Network Exploitation of a Nonrenewable Resource</br><br>Author: Rene Caldentey, New York University, Stern School of Business, 44 West Fourth Street, New York, United States of America, rcaldent@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Denis Saure</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal exploitation of a nonrenewable resource for which the sequence of extraction can be modeled using a direct graph. Nodes in the graph represent specific pockets (blocks) where the resource is concentrated. Arcs are used to model the paths (feasible sequencing) that can be used to extract these blocks. We assume that the market price of this resource changes stochastically over time.</br>
