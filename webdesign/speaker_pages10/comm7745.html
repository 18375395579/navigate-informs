        <br>Title: Validity of Heavy-traffic Steady-state Approximations in Many-server Queues with Abandonment</br><br>Author: J.G. Jim Dai, Professor, School of ORIE, Cornell University (on leave from Georgia Institute of Technology), 221 Rhodes Hall, 136 Hoy Road, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, jim.dai@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuefeng Gao, Ton Dieker</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider GI/Ph/n+M parallel-server queues that have a renewal arrival process, a phase-type service time distribution, n homogenous servers, and an exponential patience time distribution with positive rate. We show that in the Halfin-Whitt regime, under exponential integrability assumptions on the distribution of interarrival times, in steady-state, a pair of total-customer-count process and server-allocation processes, normalized by the square root of n, is tight.</br>
