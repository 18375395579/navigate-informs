        <br>Title: Validity of Heavy-traffic Steady-state Approximations in Open Queueing Networks</br><br>Author: Itai Gurvich, Doctoral Student, Columbia Business School, Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States, ig2126@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Assaf Zeevi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Semi-Martingale Reflected Brownian Motions (SRBMs) are often used to approximate the dynamics of multi-class queueing networks in heavy-traffic. Process level convergence has been established under fairly general conditions. A separate question concerns the rigorous justification of approximating the steady-state of the underlying queueing network using its SRBM analogue. In this talk we give a broad set of sufficient conditions under which the above question can be answered in the affirmative.</br>
