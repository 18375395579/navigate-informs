        <br>Title: Variance Minimization for Constrained Discounted Continuous-time Markov Decision Processes</br><br>Author: Jun Fei, Stony Brook University, Dept of Applied Mathematics & Statistics, Stony Brook, NY, 11794, United States of America, royfei@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eugene Feinberg</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper compares variances of optimal policies for constrained  discounted Continuous-Time Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).  According to the existing theory, optimal policies exist in the  form of switching and randomized policies. In the paper we  interpret discounting as exponentially distributed stopping time.  We provide an index-type formula for the switching policy with the  minimal variance and show that it has the smaller variance than the  optimal randomized policy.</br>
