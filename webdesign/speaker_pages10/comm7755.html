        <br>Title: Design for Controllability: Controllability for Complex Networks under Failures</br><br>Author: Amirhossein Khosrojerdi, The University of Oklahoma, 202 W. Boyd St., Room 124, Norman, OK, United States of America, akhosrojerdi@ou.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Farrokh Mistree, Krishnaiya Thulasiraman, Janet Allen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a three-step method to consider the impact of structural controllability on designing systems. First, a method based on Decision Support Problem (DSP) is used to generate a set of system design alternatives. Second, a graph-theoretic method based on the cactus notion is proposed to find sufficient conditions for a system to be structurally controllable. Finally, cDSP is applied to design structural controllable systems.</br>
