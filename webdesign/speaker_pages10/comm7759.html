        <br>Title: Inventory Pooling to Satisfy Multiple Service Levels</br><br>Author: Aydin Alptekinoglu, Assistant Professor, Department of Decision & Information Sciences, Warrington College of Business, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, aalp@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anand Paul</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: What are the optimal ordering and allocation policies that minimize the inventory level when a pool of inventory is used to satisfy individual type-one service levels for multiple customers? In seeking an answer to this research question, we find that pooling helps even when the demands are perfectly positively correlated, and that the aggregate service level (the probability that the pooled inventory exceeds the total demand) is generally less than the minimum of the individual service levels.</br>
