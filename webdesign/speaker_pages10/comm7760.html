        <br>Title: Supply Chain Distribution Logistics to Minimize Inventory Holding Cost with Dominant Upstream Partner</br><br>Author: U.V Manoj, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, United States, muv031000@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chelliah Sriskandarajah, Sushil Gupta</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a two stage supply chain with a dominant upstream partner. Finding an optimal schedule to minimize inventory holding cost for the downstream member is NP-Hard. Under this situation, we provide efficient Genetic Algorithm using optimized crossover technique to arrive at near optimal solutions.</br>
