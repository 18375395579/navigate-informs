        <br>Title: Stochastic Sequential Assignment Problem with Threshold Criteria</br><br>Author: Golshid Baharian, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, United States of America, gbahari2@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sheldon Jacobson</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A class of problems is presented where available distinct resources are allocated to sequentially arriving tasks with stochastic parameters so as to minimize the probability of the total reward failing to achieve a target value. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a deterministic Markov optimal policy are derived. Moreover, an algorithm to approximate the optimal value function and the optimal policy is presented, and convergence results are established.</br>
