        <br>Title: Characterizing the Effect of Inexact Size Information in Size-Based Policies</br><br>Author: Adam Wierman, acw@cs.cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: When studying policies that prioritize small jobs theoriticians traditionally assume that policies have exact knowledge of job sizes, which is not true in practice.  In this work, we define a class of policies that formalizes the heuristic of prioritizing small jobs in a loose enough manner so as to include policies that schedule using inexact job sizes.  We then characterize the impact of inexact job size information by bounding the behavior of this classificiation.</br>
