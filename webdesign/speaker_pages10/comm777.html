        <br>Title: Routing in Systems with Flexible Multi-server Pools</br><br>Author: Alexander Stolyar, Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, 600 Mountain Ave, 2C-322, Murray Hill, NJ, 07974, United States of America, stolyar@research.bell-labs.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tolga Tezcan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A general model with multiple input flows (classes)  and several flexible multi-server pools is considered.  We propose a robust, generic algorithm for routing new arrivals,  which optimally balances server pools' loads, without   the knowledge of the flow input rates and without solving   any optimization problem. We study behavior   of the algorithm in the fluid limit and Halfin-Whitt (or, QED)  asymptotic regimes.</br>
