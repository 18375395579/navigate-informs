        <br>Title: Staffing Call Centers Using Fixed-queue-ratio and Simulation-based Optimization</br><br>Author: Itay Gurvich, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, i-gurvich@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Zohar Feldman, Ward Whitt</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study call centers with multiple customer classes and multiple agent pools. Building on the Fixed-Queue-Ratio family of routing rules, we develop a simulation-based optimization procedure to solve the problem of minimizing staffing costs while maintaining pre-specified quality-of-service constraints of various types. We illustrate the performance of our procedure by applying it to realistic settings with time varying arrivals and staffing levels that are allowed to vary throughout the day.</br>
