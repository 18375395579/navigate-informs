        <br>Title: Asymptotic Optimality of a Fixed-Point-Based Threshold Control</br><br>Author: David D. Yao, Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, yao@ieor.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Heng-Qing Ye</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In a prior work, Li and Yao, a stochastic network with simultaneous resource occupancy is studied, and a threshold control policy is proposed based on a fixed-point approximation. Here, we establish the asymptotic optimality of this control policy under fluid and diffusion scaling, and discuss its application in airline revenue management.</br>
