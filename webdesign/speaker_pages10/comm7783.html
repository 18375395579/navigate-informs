        <br>Title: Algorithms for Parallel Machine Problems with Capacity Restrictions</br><br>Author: Hans Kellerer, Professor, Karl-Franzens-Universitaet, Institut fur Statistik und O.R., Universitaetsstrasse 15, Graz, A-8010, Austria, hans.kellerer@kfunigraz.ac.at</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We present approximation algorithms for two variants of the classical multiprocessor scheduling with the objective of minimizing the makespan. In the first problem  considered jobs have a restricted set of machines to which they may be assigned. In the second problem class considered a limit is imposed on the number of jobs which  can be processed on each machine.</br>
