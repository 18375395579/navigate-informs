        <br>Title: Law for the i^th Waiting Time in a Busy Period of a G/M/1 Queue</br><br>Author: Opher Baron, University of Toronto, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, Opher.Baron@Rotman.Utoronto.Ca</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We use induction to derive the distribution of the waiting time of the i^{th} waiting customer in a busy period for a G/M/1 queue with a first come first serve service.  We use the Lindley recursion to relate our result to a conditional distribution of random walk and a one-sided regulated random walk.</br>
