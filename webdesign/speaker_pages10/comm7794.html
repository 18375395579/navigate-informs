        <br>Title: Priority Assignment under Imperfect Information on Customer Type Identities</br><br>Author: Serhan Ziya, University of North Carolina, 213 Smith Building CB# 3260, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America, ziya@unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nilay Argon</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a single server queue with two types of customers who do not reveal their type identities, but provide signals which indicate the likelihood of their being type 1, the type that is favored by the c-mu rule. We find that the policy that prioritizes customers according to their probabilities of being type 1 outperforms all finite-class priority policies and identify conditions under which prioritizing according to signals outperforms FCFS when information provided by signals is weaker.</br>
