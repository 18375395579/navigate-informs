        <br>Title: Environment-dependent Ordering Policies in a Production-inventory System in a Random Environment</br><br>Author: Keqi Yan, SAS Institute Inc., 500 SAS Campus Dr., Cary, 27513, United States of America, Keqi.Yan@sas.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vidyadhar Kulkarni</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We study a general production-inventory system where production and demand rates are modulated by a random environment process. When orders from external suppliers are needed, the order quantities can be depend on the state of the environment at the time of order placement. We study the limiting behavior of this system and derive a general stochastic decomposition property in a matrix form. We develop a method to compute the optimal ordering policies that minimize the long run average costs.</br>
