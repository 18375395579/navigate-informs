        <br>Title: A Numerical Comparison of Equilibria for Single Period and Multi-Period Games</br><br>Author: Tapas K. Das, Professor, Department of Industrial & Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, ENB118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, das@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vishnu Nanduri, Cihan Babayigit</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A majority of the oligopolistic energy market models focus on obtaining equilibria for single period (one shot) games with constant demand. We develop a multi-period model capable of incorporating stochastic demand variations, and a simulation & learning based solution approach. A multi period equilibrium solution is developed for a sample network for which a single period game solution is available in literature. The solutions are compared for various numerical scenarios.</br>
