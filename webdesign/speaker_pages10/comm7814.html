        <br>Title: The Perishable (Q,r) Model with Fixed Shelf-lives and Lead Times: Renewal Demands</br><br>Author: Emre Berk, Bilkent University, Department of Management, Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey, eberk@bilkent.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ulku Gurler</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a perishable inventory system with a single product having a constant shelflife. External demands are generated by a compound renewal process with inter-arrival times having a generalized Erlang distribution. Lead times are constant and excess demand is lost. We employ the (Q,r) control policy where r > mQ for m >1. We develop the operating characteristics of the model, establish its certain analytical properties, and present some numerical results.</br>
