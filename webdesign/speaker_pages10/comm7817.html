        <br>Title: A Semidefinite Optimization-based Approach to Systems of Coupled Queues</br><br>Author: Constantine Caramanis, Assistant Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept, Austin, TX, United States of America, cmcaram@ece.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Balaji Rengarajan, Gustavo de Veciana</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider systems of non-work conserving coupled queues, where the service rates depend on all the queue lengths. Such models arise naturally in systems with shared resources. Coupled queuing systems are notoriously difficult to analyze and steady state queue length distributions are known only in some special cases. We consider a semi-definite optimization-based moment approach that provides tight bounds on the steady-state mean sum queue-length, and we use this for optimal system design.</br>
