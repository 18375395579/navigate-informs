        <br>Title: Approximation Algorithms for the Mulit-Item Capacitated Lot-Sizing Problem Via Flow-Cover Inequalities</br><br>Author: Retsef Levi, Robert N. Noyce Career Development Professor, Assitant Professor of Management, MIT, Sloan School of Management, 50 Memorial Drive, E53-389, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States, retsef@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maxim Sviridenko, Andrea Lodi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the classical multi-item capacitated lot-sizing problem with N items and T periods. The goal is to minimize the overall fixed ordering costs and holding costs. This problem is strongly NP-hard. We propose a novel LP-relaxation that is based on a subset of the well-known flow-cover inequalities, and show how to use this LP to construct a feasible solution, which cost is guaranteed to be at most twice the optimal cost.</br>
