        <br>Title: Scheduling Despite Inexact Job Size Information</br><br>Author: Adam Wierman, Assistant Professor, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E. California Blvd, Pasadena, CA, 91125, United States of America, adamw@caltech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Misja Nuyens</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Motivated by the optimality of Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) for mean response time, many computer systems have begun to favor small jobs. However, rarely do computer systems have knowledge of exact remaining sizes. In this paper, we prove new results characterizing the impact of inexact job size information on the performance of SRPT and related policies.</br>
