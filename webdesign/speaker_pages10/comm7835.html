        <br>Title: Cyclic Facility Layout Problem</br><br>Author: Sadan Kulturel-Konak, Professor of Management Information System, Pennsylvania State University, Tulpehocken Rd., PO Box 7009, Reading, PA, 19610, United States of America, sadan@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Abdullah Konak</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Cyclic Facility Layout Problem (CFLP) is a special case of Dynamic Facility Layout Problem (DFLP) where there are several production periods and the production cycle repeats itself by going to the first period after the last period because of the seasonal nature of product type and demands.  In this study, a large scale hybrid simulated annealing (LS-HSA) approach is proposed to solve the CFLP. Results show that the proposed LS-HSA approach is effective.</br>
