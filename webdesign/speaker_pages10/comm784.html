        <br>Title: Large Deviations of Queues Served by a Wireless Channel</br><br>Author: Alexander Stolyar, Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, 600 Mountain Ave, 2C-322, Murray Hill, NJ, 07974, United States of America, stolyar@research.bell-labs.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Multiple queues, each with own input flow,  are served by a wireless channel whose capacity varies  randomly and asynchronously with respect to different  queues. The problem is to find a scheduling   algorithm that optimally controls  large deviations of the queues, namely  maximizes the minimum (weighted) exponential decay rates of   the queues' distribution tails. We prove optimality of the   simple and parsimonious exponential (EXP) scheduling rule.</br>
