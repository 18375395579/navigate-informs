        <br>Title: Revenue Management for the e-Service Industry: Price and Service Level Segmentation</br><br>Author: Tieming Liu, Assistant Professor, Oklahoma State University, 322 Engineering North, Stillwater, OK, 74078, United States, tieming.liu@okstate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Parijat Dube, Laura Wynter</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study a joint pricing and capacity allocation model for an e-service provider facing multi-type of demands and competitors. We apply the Logit model to describe demand diversions among different service classes and different periods, and we use recent results in queueing theory to approximate the QoS of each service class. Computational analyses are provided to develop insights into the benefits of the yield management model, as well as the impacts of service capacity and demand structure.</br>
