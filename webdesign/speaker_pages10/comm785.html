        <br>Title: Optimal Order Routing in Limit Order Markets</br><br>Author: Arseniy Kukanov, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, 544 West 113 Street, 2R, New York, NY, 10025, United States of America, arseniy.kukanov@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rama Cont</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We formulate and solve a problem of optimal limit order routing and study how an interplay between the state of order books, the fee structure, order flow properties and preferences of a trader influence his routing decision. In a case when one exchange is used for order execution we derive a closed-form solution for optimal limit and market order sizes. We also propose and test a stochastic algorithm for solving this problem in general order execution applications with multiple exchanges.</br>
