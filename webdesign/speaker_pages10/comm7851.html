        <br>Title: Demand Estimation from Censored Observations with Inventory Record Inaccuracy</br><br>Author: Adam Mersereau, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, CB 3490, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, United States of America, ajm@unc.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a newsvendor estimating a demand distribution from historical sales data.  The newsvendor uses stocking levels to account for censoring but these stocking levels are subject to unobserved errors.  We discover a systematic downward bias in demand estimates even while service levels may appear to the firm to exceed targets.  We propose a heuristic correction that sharply reduces the bias.</br>
