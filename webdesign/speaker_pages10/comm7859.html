        <br>Title: Dynamic Real-Time Models for Order Promising</br><br>Author: Michael Ball, Professor, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States, mball@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Fu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We develop dynamic, real-time models for making order promising decisions. These models monitor order-promising and factory data and dynamically update key decision parameters, most notably the promised lead time. Policies are based on an MDP model, where certain parameters are set based on the periodic solution of a mixed integer program.</br>
