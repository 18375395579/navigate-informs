        <br>Title: Reactive Scheduling in the MRCPSP Through Optimal Search Techniques</br><br>Author: Filip Deblaere, Catholic University Leuven, FETEW, KBI, Naamsestraat 69, Leuven, BE-3000, Belgium, filip.deblaere@econ.kuleuven.be</br><br>Coauthor(s): Willy Herroelen, Erik Demeulemeester</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) involves the determination of a baseline schedule of the project activities, which can be executed in multiple modes, satisfying the precedence relations and resource constraints while minimizing the project duration. During the execution of the project, the baseline schedule may become unfeasible due to numerous types of disruptions. We propose an optimal reactive scheduling procedure for repairing a disrupted schedule.</br>
