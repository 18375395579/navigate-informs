        <br>Title: George-Harrison II: Dynamic Control of a Queue with Admission Control and Adjustable Service Rate</br><br>Author: John Hasenbein, Associate Professor, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C2200, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, jhas@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): A. Kranthi Mitra</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We resolve several open questions posed in a 2001  OR paper by George and Harrison. That paper investigated dyanamic  control of a queue with general holding costs, adjustable  service rates, and a cost of effort function. We  relax assumptions on the cost of effort function,  allowing admission control, and we prove that stationary  policies are optimal in this system. It is also shown  that the elegant G-H algorithm can be extended.</br>
