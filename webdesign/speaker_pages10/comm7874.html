        <br>Title: Lift Queue Dynamics in Automated Vehicle Storage and Retrieval System Cycle Time Estimation</br><br>Author: Li Zhang, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, CII 5015, 110 8th Street, Troy, NY, United States, zhangli@rpi.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ananth Krishnamurthy, Charles Malmborg</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: An embedded M/G/V model is proposed for estimating the performance of automated vehicle storage and retrieval (AVSR) systems as functions of the major variables defining a storage system configuration. We consider a system consisting of V vehicles, each of which works together with a lift conditionally. The lift queue dynamics are described as a GI/G/L/V queue model nested in a general M/G/V queue model. The results of simulation validation studies illustrate the accuracy of this approach.</br>
