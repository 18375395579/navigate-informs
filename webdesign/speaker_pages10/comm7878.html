        <br>Title: A Production-inventory System with Two Customer Classes and Both Backorders and Lost Sales</br><br>Author: Saif Benjaafar, Professor & Division Director, University of Minnesota, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States, saif@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tingliang Huang, Mohsen Elhafsi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider the optimal control of a production inventory-system with a single product and two customer classes. Upon arrival, customer orders can be fulfilled from existing inventory, if there is any, backordered, or rejected. Backorder and lost sales costs vary from class to class. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy.</br>
