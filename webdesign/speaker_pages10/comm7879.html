        <br>Title: Payment Incentives to Trade-off Speed and Quality in Large Service Systems</br><br>Author: Amy Ward, Associate Professor, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, Bridge Hall 401H, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States of America, amyward@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dongyuan Zhan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In service systems, it is important that customers have both low wait times and good quality of service.  However, in human-intensive services like call centers, there can be tension between serving customers quickly (which reduces wait times) and providing better service quality by spending more time with each customer (which increases wait times).  We propose a payment scheme whose purpose is to guide each agent's speed-quality trade-off decision.</br>
