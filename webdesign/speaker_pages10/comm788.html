        <br>Title: An Optimal Approach to Service Differentiated Spare Parts Management</br><br>Author: Ulrich Thonemann, Professor, Department of Supply Chain Management and Management Science, University of Cologne, Albertus-Magnus-Platz, Koeln, K, 50923, Germany, Ulrich.Thonemann@uni-koeln.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karin Moellering</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We consider a critical level policy for a periodic review inventory system with two demand classes. Since traditional approaches cannot be used to find the optimal parameters of the policy, we use a multi-dimensional Markov chain to model the inventory system. We use a sample path approach to prove several properties of this inventory system. Although the cost function is not convex we can build on these properties to develop an approach that finds the optimal solution.</br>
