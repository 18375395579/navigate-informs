        <br>Title: An Optimizing Scheduler for Large-Scale Stream-Based Distributed Computer Systems</br><br>Author: Joel Wolf, IBM Research, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Hawthorne, NY, 10532, United States, jlwolf@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nikhil Bansal, Lisa Fleischer, Kirsten Hildrum, Deepak Rajan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Stream processing systems pose unique scheduling challenges. Jobs process unending streams of data. The same job may be done in multiple ways, and may be interconnected in various ways to other jobs. This is very different from traditional scheduling. We present a mathematical overview of a scheduler for a distributed stream processing system. The scheduler chooses which jobs to accept, how to connect them, how much processing to allocate to them, and how to distribute this work on the system.</br>
