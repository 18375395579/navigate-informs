        <br>Title: Multi-priority M/M/c Queue</br><br>Author: Jianfu Wang, PhD Candidate, University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S3E6, Canada, jianfu.wang08@rotman.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Opher Baron</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The multi-priority M/M/c queue has been widely studied.  However its exact analysis was restricted to cases with identical service rates for different customer priorities.  We use novel queueing analysis to provide closed form solution when service rates differ.</br>
