        <br>Title: Impatience Differentiation in Large-scale Service Systems with Customer Reentrance</br><br>Author: Guodong Pang, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States of America, gup3@engr.psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Weining Kang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider large-scale service systems where customers need to reenter the system to fulfill their further service requests and the reentry may happen after some random delay time. We assume that the patience times of new and reentrant customers may have different distributions. Under mild assumptions on the general interarrival, service, delay and patience delay times, we investigate the impact of the impatience differentiation upon the service performance in such systems.</br>
