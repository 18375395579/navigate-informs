        <br>Title: Asymptotics of a Class of Workforce Capacity Planning Problems</br><br>Author: David Yao, Columbia University, Dept. of IEOR, New York, NY, United States of America, yao@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yingdong Lu, Mark Squillante</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the capacity problem of matching the supply of resources and the uncertain demand for resources over a planning horizon of N periods, with the provision that a set of resource capacity decisions must be made before the first period. Our approach consists of constructing upper- and lower-bounds for the expectation of the running maximum of the difference between cumulative demand and cumulative capacity up to period n, and analyzing the asymptotic behavior of these bounds for large N.</br>
