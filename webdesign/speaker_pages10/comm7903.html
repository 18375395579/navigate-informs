        <br>Title: Worst-case Analysis of the Quality of Neighborhoods for Minimizing Makespan on Identical Machines</br><br>Author: Johann Hurink, Professor, University of Twente, Department of Applied Mathematics, PO Box 217, Enschede, 7500 AE, Netherlands, j.l.hurink@utwente.nl</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this talk we consider local search methods for a multiprocessor scheduling problem where jobs have to be scheduled on  identical parallel machines such that the latest completion of jobs (the makespan) is minimized.  We give worst-case performance guarantees for local optima with respect to several large scale neighborhood structures for the considered problem.</br>
