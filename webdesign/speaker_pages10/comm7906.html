        <br>Title: Scheduling Support-Times for Satellites with Overlapping Visibilities</br><br>Author: Gokcen Arkali, The University of Texas-Dallas, PO Box 830688, 2601 N. Floyd Road, Richardson, TX, 75083-0688, United States, gxa023000@utdallas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chelliah Sriskandarajah, Milind Dawande</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider the scheduling of ground-station support-times to low-earth-orbit satellites with overlapping visibilities. A ground-station provides support-time to a satellite to perform a variety of tasks. We propose eight basic scheduling models to study the problem and investigate the computational complexity status of each model.</br>
