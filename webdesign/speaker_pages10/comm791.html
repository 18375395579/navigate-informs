        <br>Title: Nonnegative Pareto-improving Tolls with Multiclass Network Equilibrium</br><br>Author: Ziqi Song, University of Florida, Weil Hall 508, Gainesville, FL, 32611, United States, ziqi@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yafeng Yin, Siriphong Lawphongpanich</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study considers nonnegative Pareto-improving toll vectors that improve the social benefit without making anyone worse off in a network with multiple user classes. Since requiring tolls to be nonnegative and anonymous may not be feasible in all cases, the existence conditions for such toll vectors are discussed.</br>
