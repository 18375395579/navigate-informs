        <br>Title: Gaussian Approximation for A Fork-join Network with Non-exchangeable Synchronization</br><br>Author: Guodong Pang, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University, Industrial Engineering, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, gup3@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hongyuan Lu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a fork-join network with K service stations of many servers and non-exchangeable synchronization. Each customer's service is forked into K parallel tasks, each of which is processed in the corresponding station and waits in a separate buffer to be synchronized after service completion. For general arrivals and service times of all tasks (possibly correlated), in a quality-driven many-server regime, we derive a Gaussian approximation for the service and synchronization dynamics.</br>
