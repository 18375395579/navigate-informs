        <br>Title: Bounding the Performance of Ambulance Deployment Policies</br><br>Author: Shane Henderson, Professor, Cornell University, School of ORIE, 230 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States of America, sgh9@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chaoxu Tong, Huseyin Topaloglu, Matthew Maxwell</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop bounds on the response-time performance of ambulance deployment policies. The bounds are useful in determining whether additional resources are needed to reach performance targets, and in deciding when to stop refining policies. The bounds require the solution of a number of integer programs, and use comparison methods for queues. We describe the bounds and give representative results on two realistic but not real data sets for two different cities.</br>
