        <br>Title: A Decomposition Technique for Speeding Up Single Stage Scheduling Algorithms</br><br>Author: Stefan Bock, Professor, University of Paderborn, Warburger Straﬂe 100, D-33098, Paderborn, Germany, stbo@uni-paderborn.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Pinedo</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new decomposition technique that restricts the use of unforced idle time in an optimal schedule for single stage systems with equal processing times and release dates. Based on the decomposition technique, we can solve a variety of well-known single stage scheduling problems O(n^3) times faster if p is constant.</br>
