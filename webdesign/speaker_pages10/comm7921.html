        <br>Title: Fluid Limits of Many-Servers Queues with Reneging</br><br>Author: Weining Kang, Visiting Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Mathematical Sciences, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, weikang@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kavita Ramanan</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Motivated from call centers, we consider a GI/GI/N queue system with many servers. In this system, a customer in the queue will leave and give up service if his/her patience time exceeds a random time, which has a general distribution. We derive a fluid limit of the system when N, the number of servers, goes to infinity and show that the fluid limit is the unique solution to a set of dynamic equations. In describing the dynamics of the system certain measure valued processes are used.</br>
