        <br>Title: Dynamic Programming for Efficient Container Inspection Policies</br><br>Author: Noam Goldberg, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Rd, Piscataway, United States of America, ngoldberg@rutcor.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Kantor, Jonathan Word, Endre Boros</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally combining any given set of stochastically independent diagnostic tests into an inspection system that maximizes detection subject to a budget constraint.    Our inspection policies can be represented  as mixtures of decision trees.    We present a dynamic programming algorithm that enumerates all efficient, undominated, inspection policies.  Our approach directly solves the bicriterion optimization problem, allowing for sensitivity analysis.</br>
