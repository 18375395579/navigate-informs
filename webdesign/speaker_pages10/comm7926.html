        <br>Title: Analysis of (Q,r)-inventory Models with Exponential Lead Times by Successive Lumping</br><br>Author: Flora Spieksma, Leiden University, Mathematical Institute, Niels Bohrweg 1, Leiden, 2333, Netherlands, spieksma@math.leidenuniv.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dwi Ertiningsih</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We assume that the demand is Poisson with rate lambda and the state of the  system is the current inventory position. If the position is r-nQ, we  place a new order of size Q, where the number of outstanding orders  allowed is at most K.  Sales get lost, if the inventory position is less then r-(K-1)Q.    This can be modelled as a successively lumpable PH/M/K/K-queueing model.  We will compare its performance with the (Q,r)-model with deterministic  lead times.</br>
