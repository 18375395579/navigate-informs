        <br>Title: Learning Quality from Service Outcomes</br><br>Author: Senthil Veeraraghavan, Associate Professor, The Wharton School, 3730 Walnut Street Suite 550, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a service provider whose service value is unknown to arriving customers. Service outcomes are random depending on the quality of the service provider. Customers decide whether to join the service, or renege from the service based on the limited service outcomes/reviews that they observe. We consider how service policies influence consumer learning and social welfare.</br>
