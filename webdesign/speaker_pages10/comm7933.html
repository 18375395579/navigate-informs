        <br>Title: Retail Pricing with Bayesian Demand Learning</br><br>Author: Juan Carlos Ferrer, Associate Professor, P. Universidad Católica de Chile, Casilla 306 Correo 22, Santiago, Santiago, RM, Chile, jferrer@ing.puc.cl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eduardo Flores</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the retail problem of maximizing expected profits when the demand arrival rate parameter is unknown. We provide a bound for which the model cannot learn more about the unknown parameter. Computational experiments show the benefits of learning, between 2% and 5% above the non-learning scenarios. Finally, we performed an empirical study in a Chilean retail chain, where our model worked very well.</br>
