        <br>Title: Pharmaceutical A-Frame Order Fulfillment Optimization and Throughput Models</br><br>Author: Jen Pazour, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering, Fayetteville, AR, United States of America, jpazour@uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Russell Meller</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Pharmaceutical distribution is characterized by high-value products requiring precision accuracy within short lead times.  These requirements mean that highly-automated technologies like A-Frame systems are common in pharmaceutical order fulfillment processes.  The main decisions to be addressed when designing an A-Frame are the assignment and allocation of items to the A-Frame as well as throughput considerations.  We address these decisions using optimization and throughput models.</br>
