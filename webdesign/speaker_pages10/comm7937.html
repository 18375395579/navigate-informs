        <br>Title: Job Shop Scheduling with Earliness, Tardiness and Intermediate Inventory Holding Costs</br><br>Author: Kerem Bulbul, Assistant Professor, Manufacturing Systems & Industrial Engineering, Sabanci University, Engineering & Natural Sciences, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, 34956, Turkey, bulbul@sabanciuniv.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider a job shop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the sum of tardiness, earliness (finished goods inventory holding) and intermediate (work-in-process) inventory holding costs. We develop a shifting bottleneck heuristic to minimize the total cost and demonstrate its effectiveness computationally.</br>
