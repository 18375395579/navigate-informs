        <br>Title: Using Stochastic Approximation to Compute Optimal Base-Stock Levels in Inventory Control Problems</br><br>Author: Sumit Kunnumkal, Graduate Student, Cornell University, School of ORIE, 295 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States, sumit@orie.cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Huseyin Topaloglu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We consider inventory control problems where base-stock policies are known to be optimal and propose stochastic approximation methods to compute the optimal base-stock levels. Existing methods guarantee convergence, but not necessarily to the optimal base-stock levels. In contrast, we prove that the iterates of our methods converge to the optimal base-stock levels. Computational experiments indicate that our methods provide significantly better solutions than existing methods.</br>
