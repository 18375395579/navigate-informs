        <br>Title: Many-server Heavy-traffic Limits for Time-varying Queueing Networks with Markovian Routing</br><br>Author: Ahmet Korhan Aras, Ph.D. student, North Carolina State University, 2152 Burlington Labs, 2500 Stinson Drive, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, akaras@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yunan Liu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We establish many-server heavy-traffic limit theorems for network queues allowing customer abandonment, general distributions, time-varying arrival rates, time-varying staffing levels, and customer feedbacks (after service completions) in a Markovian fashion. The limit theorems provide rigorous theoretical bases for effective fluid and diffusion approximations for the mean values and variances of performance functions such as queue lengths and waiting times.</br>
