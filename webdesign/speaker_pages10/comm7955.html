        <br>Title: Supply Performance in Contemporary Multi-echelon Inventory Systems with Multiple Sources of Demand</br><br>Author: Suman Niranjan, Visiting Assistant Professor, State University of New York - Binghamton, 4400 Vestal Parkway East, Binghamton, NY, 13902, United States of America, sniranja@binghamton.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Frank Ciarallo</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Two capacitated multi-echelon assembly systems: i) a network of manufacturers with demand for sub-assembly and final product and ii) manufacturers-warehouse-DC-retail outlets, are used in a simulation based inventory optimization approach to determine the optimal base stock levels at each stage. The gradient estimation technique of perturbation analysis is used to derive sample path estimators. We propose a heuristic approach which provides a near optimal base-stock level.</br>
