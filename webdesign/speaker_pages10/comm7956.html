        <br>Title: Non-collaborative Systems with Setup Costs</br><br>Author: Tugce Isik, Georgia Institute of Technology, 765 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, tugceisik@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sigrún Andradóttir, Hayriye Ayhan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study a system of two tandem queues with a finite buffer and two flexible servers. The servers are unable to collaborate and constant setup costs are incurred when the servers move between stations. We investigate how the server assignment policy that maximizes the long-run average profit depends on the magnitude of the setup cost.  The optimal policy is characterized for different buffer sizes.</br>
