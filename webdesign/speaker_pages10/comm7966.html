        <br>Title: Optimal Policy for a Periodic Review Inventory System with Expediting</br><br>Author: Chiwon Kim, PhD Student, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 262 Belmont Street #2, Watertown, MA, 02472, United States, chiwon@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi, Diego Klabjan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the single item periodic review inventory model with deterministic lead time and optional expediting. Under a certain expediting cost structure, we prove optimality of serialized base stock policy. The serialized base stock policy is simple, reasonable, and easily implementable. On the other hand, if the expediting cost does not have this structure, it is shown that the optimal decisions are functions of system state variables, and the corresponding optimal policy is no longer simple.</br>
