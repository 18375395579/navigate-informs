        <br>Title: Optimal Switching Time of Entertainment Shows</br><br>Author: Srini Krishnamoorthy, Assistant Professor, Ivey School of Business, Western University, London, ON, N6B3R6, Canada, skrishnamoorthy@ivey.uwo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kyle Maclean</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We model a decision problem faced by the management of a theatre that exhibits entertainment shows like movies or plays. The management has to decide every week whether they should continue with the current show or replace it with a new one. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program and outline the optimal policy that maximizes expected revenue.</br>
