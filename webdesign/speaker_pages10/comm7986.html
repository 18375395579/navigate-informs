        <br>Title: Service Systems with Postponable Acceptance and Assignment</br><br>Author: Keumseok Kang, Florida International University, 11200 SW 8th Street, Miami, FL, 33199, United States of America, kskang@fiu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kemal Altinkemer, George Shanthikumar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the dynamic order acceptance and assignment problem for a service system that provides heterogeneous services using heterogeneous servers. Unlike traditional problems, in our settings, the service system can strategically postpone acceptance and assignment decisions for orders. We formulate this problem using a dynamic and stochastic programming approach, find the structural properties of the optimal policy, propose approximate policies, and conduct extensive computational experiments.</br>
