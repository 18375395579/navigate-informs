        <br>Title: Polymatroid Optimization, Submodularity, and Joint Replenishment Games</br><br>Author: Simai He, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Department of Systems Engineering and En, Hong Kong, HK, China, smhe@se.cuhk.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shuzhong Zhang, Jiawei Zhang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we show that the optimal value maximizing a separable concave function over a polymatroid is submodular in its parameters. We discuss the application of this result in the joint replenishment games studied by Anily and Haviv (2007) and Zhang (2007).</br>
