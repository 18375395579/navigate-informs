        <br>Title: Optimizing Colorectal Cancer Screening Policy</br><br>Author: Fatih Safa Erenay, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States of America, erenay@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ritesh Banerjee, Oguzhan Alagoz</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in women, and the second leading cause of cancer death in men. CRC screenings are proven to be effective to detect and eliminate the precursor of CRC so that cancer can be prevented before it develops. We develop a finite-horizon POMDP model that can be used to obtain a patient-specific optimal lifetime screening policy. We consider two criteria: total expected quality adjusted lifetime of the patient and total cost of treatment.</br>
