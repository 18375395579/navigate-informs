        <br>Title: Innovation and Learning in the Use of Components</br><br>Author: Kamalini Ramdas, Professor, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, kramdas@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Khaled Saleh, Steven Stern, Haiyan Liu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We examine learning in the context of hip replacement surgery using a dataset from a major US hospital. We find that the learning associated with individual surgeons' experience is driven by their experience at the micro level of specific device variants, with implications for how surgery is managed and taught, and for innovation in medical devices.</br>
