        <br>Title: Optimizing the Flow of Short-Stay Patients in the Intensive Care Unit: A Simulation Model</br><br>Author: Elisa Long, Assistant Professor, Yale School of Management, New Haven, CT, 06520, United States of America, elisa.long@yale.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kusum Mathews</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: As demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds increases, optimizing patient throughput is needed.  Using 9-months of data for Yale-New Haven Hospital, we characterized “short-stay?patients (<24 hours), who account for 35% of ICU patients. Approximately 50% of short-stay patients were lower-acuity and could be treated in a step-down unit (SDU).  We developed a simulation model with priority queuing to determine the optimal allocation of ICU and SDU beds.</br>
