        <br>Title: Is Ambulance Diversion an Effective Signal of ED Crowding? Evidence from a Natural Experiment</br><br>Author: Eric Park, Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, IL, United States of America, eric-park@kellogg.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sarang Deo, Itai Gurvich</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the effect of a policy change that was intended to reduce ambulance diversions in LA County, CA. We find that the new policy succeeded in its purpose of reducing the time spent on diversion but did not reduce the fraction of ambulances being diverted. A possible explanation for this outcome, identified by our empirical analysis, is a combination of reduced effectiveness of diversion signal after the policy change and neighboring hospital effect.</br>
