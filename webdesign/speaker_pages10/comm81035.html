        <br>Title: Patients as Health Care Innovators and Developers of New Treatments, Therapies or Medical Devices</br><br>Author: Pedro Oliveira, Professor, Catolica-LisbonSchool of Business and Economics, Palma de Cima, Lisboa, 1649-023, Portugal, poliveira@ucp.pt</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We empirically investigate the role of patients of chronic diseases in the development of new treatments, therapies or medical devices (TT&DM). We studied a sub-set of diseases (Cystic Fibrosis, Asthma, Sleep Apnea and Diabetes) and found that patients, or their families, have developed about 50% of all TT&DM available. However, the main health-care players have resisted integrating them in their development cycles. Our empirical findings have important policy and managerial implications.</br>
