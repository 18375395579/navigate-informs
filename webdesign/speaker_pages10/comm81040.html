        <br>Title: Catch-up Scheduling for Childhood Immunization</br><br>Author: Faramroze Engineer, Georgia Institute of Technology, United States, fenginee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pinar Keskinocak, Larry Pickering</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We develop an Integer Programming based tool for constructing catch-up schedules for childhood immunization. The schedules ensure that all remaining doses are administered, the spacing between doses of the same vaccine adhere to the minimum gaps, and the timing of the doses do not violate the minimum age limit. Our approach is unique not only in methodology but also in the information, strategy and advice offered to the user.</br>
