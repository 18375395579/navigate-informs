        <br>Title: Stochastic Optimization for Surgical Team Selection in Robotic Surgery</br><br>Author: Armagan Bayram, Doctoral Candidate, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Isenberg School of Management, Amherst, MA, 01003, United States of America, abayram@som.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Senay Solak</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We evaluate operating room efficiency in robotic surgery through portfolio based stochastic optimization.  Although the experience of every team member makes a difference, the performance in the operating room depends on the combination of experiences. Using actual data and integrating it into a stochastic optimization framework, we identify some results on optimal team configuration for robotic surgery.</br>
