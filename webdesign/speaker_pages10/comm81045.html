        <br>Title: A Decision Support Tool for Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis Health Service Delivery</br><br>Author: Sonia Vanderby, Assistant Professor, University of Saskatchewan, 57 Campus Drive, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 5A9, Canada, sonia.vanderby@usask.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Deborah Marshall, Robert Lee, Paul Rogers, Tom Noseworthy, Michael Carter</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The rising prevalence of osteoarthritis is increasing the burden on already strained healthcare resources. Alberta Health Services managers lack tools to help inform difficult resource and process decisions. We present a system dynamics model developed as a decision support tool for the hip and knee osteoarthritis system. Simulating patients from disease onset through both medical and surgical management, the model provides insight into the resources needed to meet current and future demand.</br>
