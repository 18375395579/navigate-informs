        <br>Title: Extending Medical Preference Models to Include Lifetime Goals</br><br>Author: Gordon Hazen, Professor, Northwestern University, IEMS Department, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States, hazen@iems.northwestern.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: QALYs in medical decision analysis capture ongoing goals with impact proportional to lifetime, like mobility or comfort. Extrinsic goals, like finishing a key project or seeing a child’s graduation, are independent of lifetime. We give a wider QALY model that includes both goal types. This allows one to decline trading lifetime for health quality when remaining lifetime is short; and to refuse time with poor health quality after important life milestones - behaviors forbidden by the QALY model.</br>
