        <br>Title: A Decision Support Model for the Location of Hand Sanitizer Dispensers in Hospitals Units</br><br>Author: Laila Cure, Assistant Professor, Western Michigan University, 4601 Campus Dr., Kalamazoo, MI, 49008-5336, United States of America, laila.cure@wmich.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Noncompliance with hand hygiene guidelines is a cause of infection in hospitals. To improve compliance, hand sanitizer dispensers should be placed in convenient locations, but fire safety regulations constrain their number and distribution. We develop a model to incorporate guidelines, regulation, and hospital characteristics into the dispenser installation decision. The proposed model can help in evaluating the current locations of dispensers and in determining the best possible configuration.</br>
