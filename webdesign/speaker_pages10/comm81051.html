        <br>Title: Optimal Surge Capacity Management and Information Sharing for Emergency Departments</br><br>Author: Maria Shunko, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, mshunko@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Varun Gupta, Alan Scheller-Wolf</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: While many emergency departments (ED) in the US experience crowding, ambulances make decisions for patients?routing without information from the EDs, which worsens crowding. EDs try to overcome crowding using surge capacity. We find the optimal surge capacity policy and compare ED profit and patient wait time in two cases: 1) EDs share information, the central controller makes routing decision, and 2) ambulances make decision independently.</br>
