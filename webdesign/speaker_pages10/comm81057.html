        <br>Title: Network-Based Facility Location for Community Health Centers</br><br>Author: Christina Scherrer, Assistant Professor, Southern Polytechnic State University, 1100 S. Marietta Parkway, Atlanta, GA, 30060, United States, cscherre@spsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Griffin, Julie Swann</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We determine the best location and medical service offerings for Community Health Centers (CHCs) using a network-based facility location approach.  We expand upon an earlier model to consider weighted disease objectives and compare locations chosen by our model to existing locations based on several public health measures. We also use the model to analyze different healthcare access and coverage policy mechanisms for cost and effectiveness.</br>
