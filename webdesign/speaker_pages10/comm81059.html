        <br>Title: An Econometric Analysis of Patient Flows in the Cardiac ICU</br><br>Author: Diwas Kc, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, diwas@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper explores the rationing of bed capacity in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We find that a patient is likely to be discharged early when the occupancy in the ICU is high. This in turn leads to an increased likelihood of the patient having to be readmitted to the ICU at a later time. We analyze the capacity implications of revisits, shedding light on the question if an ICU should apply an aggressive discharge strategy.</br>
