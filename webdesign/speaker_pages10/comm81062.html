        <br>Title: An Application of Capability Analysis and Simulation to Improve Patient Flow at an Off-Site ED</br><br>Author: John F. Kros, Professor, East Carolina University, 3205 Harold Bate Building, Greenville, NC, 27858, United States of America, KROSJ@ecu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Evelyn Brown</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A low-acuity Emergency Department (ED) struggles to meet its service level goal.  An analysis of existing data revealed that the facility is not capable of meeting its existing service level goal.  To examine multiple alternatives to improve patient flow at the facility a simulation were developed.  Recommendations to the facility for alternative ways to schedule and allocate its resources in order to meet its current service level goal were made based on the results of the simulation.</br>
