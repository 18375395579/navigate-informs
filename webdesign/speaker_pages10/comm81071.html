        <br>Title: Optimal Surveillance and Eradication of Invasive Species</br><br>Author: Robert Haight, USDA Forest Service, 1992 Folwell Ave, St. Paul, MN, 55108, United States of America, rhaight@fs.fed.us</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Kean, Rebecca Epanchin-Niell, Andrew Liebhold, Ludek Berec</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Cost-effective surveillance strategies are needed for efficient responses to biological invasions of terrestrial ecosystems.  Surveillance strategies are applied in environments with continual invasion pressure, unknown number, size, and location of populations, and trade-offs between surveillance effort and management costs. We develop a decision model that accounts for these features and determines the long term equilibrium sampling effort that minimizes total expected costs of new invasions.</br>
