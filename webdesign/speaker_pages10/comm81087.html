        <br>Title: The Davao City Health System: An Approach to Optimally Locating  Community Health Facilities</br><br>Author: Ma. Esmeralda Silva, Carnegie Mellon University, Center for Economic Development, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-3890, jmec1@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Johnson</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Davao City, Philippines operates a two-tiered health system in which a large network of community-based health centers feeds into a much smaller network of regional hospitals. There is evidence of substantial inequities and gaps in service coverage. We develop an alternative two-tier system, in which a lower tier of inexpensive health outpostsis links to a smaller number of health centers. We present computational results for this hierarchical facility location problem and policy implications.</br>
