        <br>Title: Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data to Predict and Locate Prostate Cancer</br><br>Author: David Anderson, Robert H.Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, davidryberganderson@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bruce Golden, Edward Wasil, Hao Zhang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We propose a method of diagnosing prostate cancer using magnetic resonance imaging data.  Logistic regression and nearest neighbor classification are combined to identify the risk of cancer.  Our method performs well with 79% predictive accuracy and an area under the ROC curve of 0.85.</br>
