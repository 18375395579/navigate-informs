        <br>Title: Denoising of Microarray Outputs Using Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transforms</br><br>Author: Tapas K. Das, Professor, Department of Industrial & Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, ENB118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, das@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chaitra Gopalappa</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Microarrays continue to evolve as a powerful tool for assessing the expression levels of genes in DNAs. Noise in microarray data is considered to be a major hindrance to a significant number of impending breakthroughs in medical treatment and drug discovery. We discuss a multiresolution analysis based denoising approach using dual tree complex wavelet transform.</br>
