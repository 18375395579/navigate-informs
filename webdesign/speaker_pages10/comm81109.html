        <br>Title: Which Waiting Lists Should an End-stage Liver Disease Patient Join?</br><br>Author: Gorkem Saka, Health Economist, Merck Research Labs, 1122 Station Square Blvd., Lansdale, PA, 19446, United States of America, gorkem_saka@merck.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oguzhan Alagoz, Mark Roberts, Lisa Maillart, Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Each end-stage liver disease patient joins at least one waiting list in order to be eligible for cadaveric liver offers.

We propose a modified branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the problem and provide numerical results.</br>
