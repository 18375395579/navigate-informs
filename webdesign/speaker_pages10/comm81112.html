        <br>Title: An MDP Model to Compare Decision Maker Perspectives on Optimal Statin Treatment Policies</br><br>Author: Jennifer Mason, Edward P. Fitts Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, North Carolina State University, 111 Lampe Drive, 375 Daniels Hall, Raleigh, NC, 27695-7906, United States of America, jemason2@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brian Denton, Nilay Shah, Steven Smith</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Patients with Type 2 diabetes are often prescribed statins as part of their treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. We propose a Markov decision process model that optimizes the statin treatment decision. We consider three different perspectives: the patient, society, and third-party payer. We present our model formulation, discuss structural properties, and present numerical results comparing the optimal treatment policy for the three different perspectives.</br>
