        <br>Title: Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic-Based Optimization for Causal Inference with Observational data</br><br>Author: Murat Kurt, Assistant Professor, University at Buffalo, SUNY, North Campus, 309 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, muratkur@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alexander Nikolaev</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: When randomized experiments are hard or impossible to conduct, accurate assessment of treatment effects becomes difficult due to presence of confounding factors. We consider the problem of treatment effect estimation based on observational data and develop a mixed-integer programming model to identify a control group that is statistically indistinguishable from a fixed treatment group according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We present computational results on a diverse array of datasets.</br>
