        <br>Title: Discriminant Analysis and Predictive Models in Medicine</br><br>Author: Eva Lee, Associate Professor, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this talk, we describe novel optimization-based predictive models, and analyze the process of selecting critical attributes through a feature-selection algorithm. Applications to prediction of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, human cancer, and the degree of cell membrane permeabilization via assisted ultrasound (for drug delivery) will be discussed.</br>
