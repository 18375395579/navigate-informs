        <br>Title: Optimal Army Officer Retirement</br><br>Author: Andrew Hall, LTC, United States Army, 4760 N 40th St, Arlington, Va, 22207, United States of America, Andrew.O.Hall@us.army.mil</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We model an Army officer’s decision to retire as an optimal stopping problem. We solve the resulting Markov Decision Process by dynamic programming, linear programming and simulation. Previous results suggested an optimal retirement point for Lieutenant Colonels at 23 years. Our results suggest a shift in the optimal retirement point to 20 years. We explore manpower planning and policy implications of shifting retirement behavior and possible mitigation strategies.</br>
