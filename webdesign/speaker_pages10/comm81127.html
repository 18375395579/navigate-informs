        <br>Title: Health Savings Accounts: How Much to Contribute?</br><br>Author: David Lowsky, PhD Candidate, Stanford University Graduate School of Business, 518 Memorial Way, S458, Stanford, CA, 94305-5015, United States, lowsky_dave@gsb.stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stefanos Zenios</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Health savings accounts (HSAs) have been touted as a way to control rising healthcare costs. We develop a Markov healthcare cost prediction model based on a household's previous year cost percentile. The model is used to simulate a household's health savings account balance over time to determine the contribution levels necessary to reliably cover all future healthcare expenses. Cost prediction performance and HSA simulation results are presented.</br>
