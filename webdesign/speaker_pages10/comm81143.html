        <br>Title: Eliciting Cholesterol Management Guidelines' Valuation of Future Life</br><br>Author: Murat Kurt, Assistant Professor, University at Buffalo, SUNY, North Campus, 309 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, muratkur@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Osman Ozaltin, Brian Denton, Nilay Shah</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Lipid abnormalities increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. The complexity of treating these abnormalities led to the development of treatment guidelines. We consider the trade-off between the benefits and side effects of statins, and develop an inverse stochastic dynamic program to elicit time valuation of current guidelines. We use clinical data to illustrate the outcomes on Type 2 diabetes patients.</br>
