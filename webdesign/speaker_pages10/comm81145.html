        <br>Title: Prioritizing Burn-injured Patients During a Disaster</br><br>Author: Yina Lu, Columbia Business School, 3022 Broadway, 423 Uris Hall, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, ylu13@gsb.columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Linda Green, Carri Chan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The US government has mandated that, in a catastrophic event, NYC areas need to be capable of caring for 400 burn patients. The current surged capacity is only 210. We develop a new system to prioritize patients for transfer to burn beds and demonstrate its superiority over several other methods. Based on data from previous burn disasters, we find that this is unlikely to meet federal guidelines. This work has implications for how disaster plans in other metropolitan areas should be developed.</br>
