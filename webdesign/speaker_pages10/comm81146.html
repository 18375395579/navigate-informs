        <br>Title: A Bayesian Network for Predicting Invasive and In-situ Breast Cancer using Mammographic Findings</br><br>Author: Jagpreet Chhatwal, Health Economist, Merck Research Laboratories, North Wales, PA, 19454, United States of America, jchhatwal@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nassif Houssam, Edward Sickles, Oguzhan Alagoz, Elizabeth Burnside</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We developed a Bayesian Network (BN) to predict the risk of invasive and in-situ breast cancer based on patient’s prospectively collected mammographic findings and demographic factors. The structure and parameters of the BN were trained and tested on a large clinical dataset. Understanding the risk of invasive and in-situ cancer prior to biopsy can improve the clinical management of breast cancer patients.</br>
