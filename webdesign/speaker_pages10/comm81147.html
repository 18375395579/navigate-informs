        <br>Title: A Game Theoretical Approach for Hospital Stockpiling in Preparation for Pandemics</br><br>Author: Po-Ching DeLaurentis, PhD Candidate, Purdue University, 203 Martin Jischke Drive, Mann Hall Suite 225, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States of America, chenp@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elodie Adida, Mark Lawley</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Our problem addresses the issue of hospital stockpiling in preparing for a flu pandemic. Taking into account the uncertain demand that may occur under various possible pandemic scenarios, we consider the problem of determining the stockpile quantity of one critical medical item.  A game theoretical framework is used to capture any mutual aid agreement that a group of hospitals may have. A discussion on the implications of the game results will be presented.</br>
