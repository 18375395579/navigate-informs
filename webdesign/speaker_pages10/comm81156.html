        <br>Title: Physician Panel Design</br><br>Author: Wen-Ya Wang, San Jose State University, One Washington Square, San Jose, CA, United States of America, wenya.wang@sjsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diwakar Gupta</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper focuses on the physician panel design problem of determining the patient composition (i.e. panel size and types of patient) for physician panels. We investigate how clinics would allocate a given pool of two types of patients who have different propensity for requesting urgent appointments to two identical physicians.  We identify the optimal patient and capacity allocation strategies that maximize the clinic’s overall expected reward under different capacity-demand scenarios.</br>
