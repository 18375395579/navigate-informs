        <br>Title: Perceived Wait Time, Satisfaction and the Effect of Wait Time Fillers</br><br>Author: Kelly McGuire, Cornell University, 105 Cobb St, Ithaca, NY, 14850, United States, kam63@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sheryl Kimes, Mellie Pullman, Mike Lynn</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Previous research into the impact of waiting time fillers on perceived wait time and satisfaction has failed to establish a consistent effect.  A series of computer-based, laboratory experiments were conducted to first establish the processes that contribute to the relationship between perceived wait time and satisfaction, and then to test the impact of different types of time filling activities on these processes.</br>
