A key challenge in bed management is optimizing the bed assignments in a complex and dynamic operating environment. We have developed innovative decision support tools with embedded mathematical models to periodically and automatically recommend bed assignments. We have hosted our prototype bed assignment solution as a cloud based application for Mount Sinai Medical Center (MSMC) in New York and improved their hospital operations.</br>
