        <br>Title: Parameter Estimation with a Blood Flow, Blood Pressure Model</br><br>Author: Scott Pope, Research Assistant, North Carolina State University, 255 Harrelson Hall, Box 8205, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, srpope@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): C.

The human circulatory system is modeled as a collection of compartments exchanging blood. Each compartment has a compliance parameter and connections between compartments have a resistance parameter. An ODE system dependent upon our parameters is derived. We apply cutting edge optimization techniques to minimize the difference between data and model predicted values.</br>
