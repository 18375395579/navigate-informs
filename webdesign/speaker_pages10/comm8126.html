        <br>Title: Using Expert Preferences to Assess Tradeoffs among Multiple Objectives for Humanitarian Aid Delivery</br><br>Author: Erica Gralla, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Rm. E38-651, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, egralla@MIT.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Charles Fine, Jarrod Goentzel</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Modeling approaches can support better humanitarian aid delivery planning, but the trade-offs among the multiple goals of aid delivery are not adequately understood. We develop a measure to value the performance of aid delivery plans, based on expert preferences over five objectives: amount of cargo delivered, prioritization of aid by commodity type, prioritization by location, speed of delivery, and operational cost.</br>
