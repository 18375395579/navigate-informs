        <br>Title: Modeling the Logistics of Response to Anthrax Bioterrorism (Submitted for the 2006 Pierskalla Award)</br><br>Author: Margaret Brandeau, Professor, Stanford University, Management Science and Engineering, Stanford, CA, United States, brandeau@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Greg Zaric, Dena Bravata, Douglas Owens</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A bioterrorism attack with an agent such as anthrax will require rapid deployment of medical and pharmaceutical supplies to affected areas and exposed individuals. How much capacity should be built into each element of the bioterrorism response supply chain? We present a model to evaluate the costs and benefits of various strategies for pre-attack stockpiling and post-attack distribution and dispensing of medical and pharmaceutical supplies, as well as the benefits of rapid attack detection.</br>
