        <br>Title: Process Improvements in Hospitals</br><br>Author: Stefan Nickel, Saarland University, Geb A 5 3, Saarbrücken, 66041, Germany, s.nickel@orl.uni-saarland.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ursula Anna Schmidt</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Hospitals have to face an increasing pressure with respect to competition as well as in terms of cost reduction.   One instrument to overcome some problems is the employment of clinical pathways in German hospitals.  We will show in this talk how logistical elements can be incorporated into clinical paths and demonstrate that using some real world examples.     Moreover, we will have a closer look at some key logistics processes in hospitals.</br>
