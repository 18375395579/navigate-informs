        <br>Title: Scheduling and Routing Ambulances that Provide Inter-facility Patient Transfers</br><br>Author: Laleh Haerien, University of Alberta, School of Business, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R6, Canada, haerian@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Haight, Armann Ingolfsson, Angela Kercher, Mohamed Salama, Matt Stanton</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In Edmonton and Calgary, Canada, a specialized ambulance fleet transfers patients between hospitals. We use a VRP heuristic to schedule transfers that are known a day in advance, and a similar heuristic to accommodate emergent transfers in real time. Simulation experiments comparing the performance of this approach to historical schedules suggests that improvements on all performance metrics that we investigated are possible, ranging from 60% (for lateness) to 6% (for deadhead travel).</br>
