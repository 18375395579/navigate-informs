        <br>Title: Scheduling Residents To Achieve Adequate Training On Procedures With Random Occurrences</br><br>Author: William Pozehl, University of Michigan, 1075 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, pozewil@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rishindra Reddy, Amy Cohn, Mark Daskin, Ryan Chen, Andrea Obi, Jennifer Chung, Jacob Seagull</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Residents have certification case requirements for a variety of procedures (e.g., heart transplants). Call schedules rotate on a regular basis. Procedure occurrences are random. All residents will not necessarily accrue enough cases even if the total number of cases exceeds the number of residents times the requirements per resident. We develop a simulation model of this problem and outline alternative scheduling rules that increase the number of residents who can be certified.</br>
