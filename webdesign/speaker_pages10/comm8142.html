        <br>Title: The Optimal Timing of Liver Transplantation with Risk-Sensitivity Considerations</br><br>Author: Atul Bhandari, PhD Candidate, Carnegie Mellon University, 631 Hastings Street, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, abhandari79@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The only therapy for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation. Previous research has concentrated on the optimal strategy of risk-neutral patients for transplantation-timing. We extend these results to risk-sensitive patients. We formulate a MDP in which the state is the patient’s health. We show sufficient conditions for existence of a structured optimal policy and verify using clinical data. Two identical patients with different risk sensitivity are compared.</br>
