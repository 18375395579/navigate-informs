        <br>Title: Application of Lean principles to Emergency Department Discharge Process</br><br>Author: Shital Shah, Assistant Professor, Rush University Medical Center, 1700 W. Van Buren St, 126B, Chicago, IL, 60612, United States of America, Shital_C_Shah@rush.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dino Rumoro, Julio Silva</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Emergency departments (ED) are facing tremendous pressure due to overcrowding resulting in waste generation in form of inefficient resource utilization, long wait times, boarding patients, and lower patient satisfaction. Lean principles such as value stream and process flow mapping and  A3 approach not only identify process waste but also aid in streamlining ED operations. Applicability of lean principles in healthcare is demonstrated via the streamlining of ED to home discharge process.</br>
