        <br>Title: Coordinating Contracts in Value-based Healthcare Delivery</br><br>Author: Tannaz Mahootchi, PhD Candidate, Wilfrid Laurier University, 75 University Ave. West, Waterloo, ON, N2L3C5, Canada, tmahootchi@wlu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Logan McLeod, Ignacio Castillo</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Value-based healthcare delivery requires reforms to different components of the healthcare system including organizational structure, outcome/cost measurement, and provider reimbursement. This study looks at coordinating contracts between healthcare purchasers and healthcare providers in this context. A dynamic principal-agent model is used to model the interactions between treatment strategy and health outcomes, where there is a single responsible entity for the health outcomes of the patient.</br>
