        <br>Title: Inferring the Transmission Tree during an Outbreak Investigation</br><br>Author: Alexander Gutfraind, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1603 W. Taylor Street Rm. 834, MC 923, Chicago, Il, 60612, United States of America, agutfrai@uic.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jaideep Ray, Richard Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: During an outbreak of an infectious disease, public health authorities need to construct a transmission tree representing the chain  of transmission starting with the index case that introduced the infection. We propose a novel and flexible MIP approach to solving this problem and demonstrate its performance on both synthetic and real instances.</br>
