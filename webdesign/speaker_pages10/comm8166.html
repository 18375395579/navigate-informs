        <br>Title: Maximizing  the Value of Healthcare Output Through Learning</br><br>Author: Renato de Matta, Associate Professor, University of Iowa, 108 PBAB, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, renato-dematta@uiowa.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a model to find the number and type of patients  to assign physicians  that will maximize the value of healthcare output per input expended in treatment through learning.   We apply our model to plan the workload of  LASIK eye surgeons. Computational results are presented.</br>
