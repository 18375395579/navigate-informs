        <br>Title: Assessment and Identification of Efficient Strategies for Prevention of Obesity</br><br>Author: Nasim Sabounchi, Virginia Technical University, 7054 Haycock Road, Room 433, Falls Church, VA, 22044, United States of America, sabounchi@vt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kostas Triantis</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Due to the increasing obesity trend, we need to identify the most efficient and sustainable intervention strategies in turning the obesity trend. Our objective is to study how efficiency in implementing the obesity interventions, affects resources required, intervention capabilities, and obesity mitigation. We adopt a DEA approach to find appropriate model specifications, define the inputs, outputs and outcomes for the transformation process and present insights in evaluating obesity policies.</br>
