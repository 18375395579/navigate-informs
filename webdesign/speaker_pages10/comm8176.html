        <br>Title: Modeling and Optimizing the Public Health Infrastructure for Emergency Response</br><br>Author: Eva Lee, Associate Professor and Director, Georgia Institute of Technology, Ctr for Operations Research in Medicine, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chien-Hung Chen, Hannah Smalley</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Planning for a catastrophe involving a disease outbreak or mass casualties is an ongoing challenge for first responders and emergency managers. They must make critical decisions on treatment distribution points, staffing levels, impacted populations and potential impact in a compressed window of time when seconds could mean life or death.  In this talk, we present the design and implementation of a software enterprese system that provides an adaptive planning and assessment tool for large-scale emergencies. The program can assist in the design and of an all-encompassing, flexible and dynamic public health emergency response capability that requires strategic and operational systems planning.</br>
