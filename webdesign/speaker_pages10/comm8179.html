        <br>Title: Outcome and State Transition Modeling for Adaptive Interdisciplinary Pain Management</br><br>Author: Aera Leboulluec, University of Texas at Arlington, Dept. of Indus. & Manufac. Sys. Engr., Arlington, TX, 76019, United States of America, aerakim77@yahoo.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Victoria C Chen, Li Zeng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Pain management is a global health problem costing $600 billion in the U.S. alone.  UTA and UTSW are seeking adaptive treatment strategies for interdisciplinary pain management. Our framework employs approximate dynamic programming with state transition and outcome models estimated from actual patient data.  This research develops a process based on the inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted method to address endogeneity while estimating state transition and outcome models.</br>
