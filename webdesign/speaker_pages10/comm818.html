        <br>Title: Optimization-based Predictive Models in Medicine and Biology</br><br>Author: Eva Lee, Associate Professor and Director, Georgia Institute of Technology, Ctr for Operations Research in Medicine, Industrial & Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0205, United States of America, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present novel optimization-based classification models that are general purpose and suitable for developing predictive rules for large-scale heterogeneous biological and medical data sets. Application to cardiovascular risk prediction, early cancer diagnosis, mild cognitive impairment, fingerprinting of native and angiogenic microvascular networks for early diagnosis of diabetes, aging, macular degeneracy and tumor metastasis will be discussed.</br>
