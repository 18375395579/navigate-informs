        <br>Title: Clinical Workload Prediction Model for Patient-centered Medical Homes</br><br>Author: Issac Shams, Research Assistant, Wayne State University, 4815 4th Street, Detroit, MI, 48201, United States of America, er7671@wayne.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): saeede ajorlou, Kai Yang</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In current practices of medical homes, a clinical-based prediction frame is recommended because it can help match the portfolio capacity of primary care teams with the actual load generated by a set of patients. In this talk, by extending the hierarchical generalized linear model to include multivariate responses, we  present a workload  prediction  model  for  care  portfolio  demands  in  a  Bayesian framework.</br>
