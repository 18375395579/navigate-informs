        <br>Title: A Partially Observable Model for the Liver Transplant Waiting List</br><br>Author: Burhaneddin Sandikci, Assistant Professor, University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, burhaneddin.sandikci@chicagogsb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Roberts, Lisa Maillart, Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The liver transplantation system in the United States publishes incomplete information about the composition of the liver transplant waiting list. We model and analyze the accept/reject decision of a liver patient under this incomplete information system as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). We compare the POMDP model to a previous MDP model to obtain more precise estimates of the patient’s price of privacy. We present the results of clinically driven numerical experiments.</br>
