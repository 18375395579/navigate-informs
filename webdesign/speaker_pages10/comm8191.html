        <br>Title: Performance Measurement of the Military Health System: A Multi-Objective Approach</br><br>Author: Nathaniel D. Bastian, PhD Student/Captain, The Pennsylvania State University, United States Army, 355 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, nathaniel.bastian@fulbrightmail.org</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lawrence V. Fulton</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Senior leaders within the Military Health System want to analyze how system inputs and outputs can be optimized to improve healthcare resource allocation decisions while balancing costs, quality and access. Therefore, this work proffers an optimization model that adjusts resources automatically across all military medical treatment facilities to achieve maximum system efficiency, which provides decision-support and insight for leaders interested in evaluating multiple objectives simultaneously.</br>
