        <br>Title: What Pilots and the Airline Industry Can Teach Clinicians and Hospitals About Patient Safety</br><br>Author: Mark Roberts, Professor, University of Pittsburgh, 130 De Soto Street, A620 Crabtree Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, mroberts@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brent James, Arnold Barnett</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The airline industry has made tremendous advanced in the safety of aviation over the past 30 years, and has successfully ingrained a culture of safety into operations. As reported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the formation of the Commercial Aviation Safety Team in the mid 1990’s has reduced several types of airline fatalities to near zero.  Unfortunately, after the landmark To Err Is Human report by the Institute of Medicine noted huge numbers of patients are harmed and die as a result of errors, no similar improvement has been witnessed in health care patient safety. This panel will explore how the successes of safety improvement in aviation can be translated into health care.</br>
