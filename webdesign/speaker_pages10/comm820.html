        <br>Title: Evaluation of Breast Cancer Mammography Screening Policies Considering Adherence Behavior</br><br>Author: Mahboubeh Madadi, University of Arkansas, 4207 Bell Engineering Center 1, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, mmadadi@uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shengfan Zhang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The efficacy of mammography screening guidelines is highly associated with women’s compliance with these recommendations. However, none of the existing policies take women’s adherence behavior into consideration. Instead, perfect adherence is often assumed. In this study, a partially observable Markov model is proposed to evaluate and compare various screening policies, while incorporating variation in women’s adherence behavior.</br>
