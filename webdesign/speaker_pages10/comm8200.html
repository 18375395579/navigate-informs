        <br>Title: Increasing Revenue and Reducing Waiting Times, Applications at the Indiana University Medical Group</br><br>Author: John Norris, Doctoral Candidate, Purdue University, Krannert School of Management, 403 W. State Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907-2056, United States, norrisjb@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Herb Moskowitz, Suresh Chand, Deanna Willis</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: An outpatient clinic concerned with patient waiting times and physician completion times tries to increase capacity utilization and thus revenue.  However, factory physics concepts explain how times increase exponentially with higher utilization levels, thus posing challenges for the clinic. We show how improvements at an outpatient clinic can simultaneously achieve higher capacity utilization levels and shorten patient waiting times while allowing physicians to complete their schedule earlier</br>
