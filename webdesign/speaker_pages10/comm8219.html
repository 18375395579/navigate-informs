        <br>Title: A Column-generation-based Technique for Multi-criteria Direct Aperture Optimization</br><br>Author: Ehsan Salari, Research Associate, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Francis H Burr Proton Therapy, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, 02114, United States of America, salari.ehsan@mgh.harvard.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Craft, Jan Unkelbach</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Multi-criteria optimization (MCO) has proved to be a promising approach to radiation therapy treatment planning. MCO is typically employed in the Fluence-map optimization stage to find a Pareto-optimal solution that yields the desired trade-off between treatment evaluation criteria. In this study we investigate the extension of the MCO approach to the direct aperture optimization problem and develop heuristics to obtain a collection of apertures that can approximate the Pareto surface.</br>
