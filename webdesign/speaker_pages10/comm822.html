        <br>Title: Optimizing the Scenario Positions for Robust Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning</br><br>Author: Albin Fredriksson, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of mathematics, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sw, 100 44, Sweden, albfre@kth.se</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Worst case optimization over a set of scenarios is a way to achieve radiation therapy plans that are robust to uncertainties. However, the multiple scenarios exacerbate the conflict between target coverage and healthy tissue sparing, and may lead to unnecessary sacrifices of plan quality even in scenarios with no conflicts. We therefore optimize the scenario positions while enforcing minimum requirements, thereby determining scenario positions where the goals can be simultaneously satisfied.</br>
