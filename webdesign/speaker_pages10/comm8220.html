        <br>Title: MINLP Model for Scheduling the Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Early Stage Breast Cancer</br><br>Author: Sergiy Butenko, Assistant Professor, Texas A&M University, Department of Industrial and Systems Eng, College Station, TX, 77843-3131, United States of America, butenko@tamu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sera Kahruman, Elif Ulusal, Illya Hicks, Kathleen Diehl</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Based on the data available through published trial  results, we propose a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)  model in order to find an optimal treatment plan for a given Hr+  early stage breast cancer patient who is postmenopausal. The results of numerical experiments suggest the effectiveness of some of the schedules currently used in practice, as well as indicate some effective alternative treatment plans.</br>
