        <br>Title: Scheduling Issues in the Service Industry</br><br>Author: Jonathan Bard, Professor, The University of Texas, 1 University Station C2200, Mechanical Engineering, Austin, TX, 78712-0292, United States, jbard@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Personnel planning and scheduling problems are complicated by a host of labor laws, union rules, and aperiodic fluctuations in demand. In situations where shortages exist, such as in the health care industry, many organizations have adopted policies that give increased weight to the preferences and requests of their staff, often at considerable cost.  Nevertheless, cost minimization must be the objective of any organization that expects to survive in the long run.</br>
