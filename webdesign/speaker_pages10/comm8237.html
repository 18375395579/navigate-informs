        <br>Title: Waiting Patiently: Abandonment from Emergency Department Queues</br><br>Author: Robert Batt, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3730 Walnut St., Huntsman Hall, Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, batt@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marcelo Olivares, Christian Terwiesch</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present an empirical study of patient abandonment behavior from a hospital emergency department queue. We show that patients respond differently to queue length and expected wait time despite the fact that these two measures are proportional to each other. We also consider the impact of providing wait time estimates to patients and under what conditions this can lead to reduced social welfare.</br>
