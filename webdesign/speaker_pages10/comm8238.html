        <br>Title: Optimal Screening Strategies of Patients on the Kidney Transplant Waiting List</br><br>Author: Alireza Sabouri, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, Alireza.Sabouri@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven Shechter, Tim Huh</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The health condition of patients on the kidney transplant waiting list deteriorates while they are waiting for an organ arrival and hence they may no longer be suitable for transplant. Therefore, transplant centers screen waiting patients at various intervals to identify ineligible patients. We propose a model for finding screening strategies that minimizes the expected screening cost and the expected penalty cost associated with transplanting an organ to an ineligible patient.</br>
