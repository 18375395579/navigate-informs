        <br>Title: Privacy Protection of Microdata with Individual Identifiers</br><br>Author: Steven Thompson, Assistant Professor, University of Richmond, 1 Gateway Drive, Richmond, VA, 23173, United States, sthomps3@richmond.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Garfinkel, Ram Gopal</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The ability to disseminate individually identifiable microdata is important in areas such as health care and national security to ensure public health and safety. We develop a technique that enables the release of individually identifiable microdata in a manner that maximizes the utility of the released data while providing protection of confidential data. Computational results show that the method is practical and that useful data can be released even when the level of risk in the data is high.</br>
