        <br>Title: Simulation Modeling and Analysis of a Multi-resource Medical Clinic</br><br>Author: Bo Sun, University of Louisville, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, 40292, United States of America, B0SUN004@louisville.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brooke Sweeney, Gerald Evans, Lihui Bai</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate a medical clinic that offers a range of face-to-face services for overweight children by providers such as medical doctors, nutritionist and psychologist. The multi-resource nature of the clinic experiences asymmetric no-show rates amongst providers. Through the development and analysis of a long period simulation model, we investigate various appointment scheduling schemes in order to improve both the clinic’s efficiency and patient satisfaction.</br>
