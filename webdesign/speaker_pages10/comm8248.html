        <br>Title: Whole-hospital Operational Forecasting System</br><br>Author: David S. Toledano, GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, 12309, United States of America, toledano@ge.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Onur I. Dulgeroglu, Bex G. Thomas, Kunter S. Akbay, Peter L. Katlic</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Hospitals make complex patient flow decisions throughout the day to manage admissions from Emergency, Surgery and elsewhere into a scarce supply of inpatient beds, with relatively little decision support to identify those likely to be over-subscribed.  In partnership with the Mount Sinai Medical Center (MSMC) in New York, we are prototyping a novel whole-hospital forecasting system which accurately estimates patient flow movements and bed shortages over the next 24 hours and displays operational feedback through interactive dashboards. Our system utilizes real-time data and historical patterns within a discrete-event simulation and currently achieves in excess of 98% accuracy on forecast census at the hospital level.</br>
