        <br>Title: Optimal Design of the Annual Influenza Vaccine with Autonomous Manufacturer</br><br>Author: Osman Ozaltin, Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, CPH 3671, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, oozaltin@uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, Oleg Prokopyev</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Seasonal influenza is a major public health concern, and the first line of defense is the flu shot. We model the annual influenza strain selection problem as a bilevel stochastic mixed-integer program. Calibrated over publicly available data, our model determines the optimal flu shot composition and production in a stochastic and dynamic environment. We also analyze the effects of yield uncertainty, price, and production cost on the flu shot production.</br>
