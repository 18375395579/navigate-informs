        <br>Title: Stress on the Ward: Evidence of Safety Tipping in Hospitals</br><br>Author: Stefan Scholtes, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, s.scholtes@jbs.cam.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ludwig Kuntz, Roman Mennicken</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We confirm the existence of workload-related safety tipping points for in-hospital mortality using discharge records of 83,485 patients in 234 clinical departments. We use a survival model with discharge selection and estimate that 12% of all deaths of patients who experience workload above the tipping point can be explained by workload.</br>
