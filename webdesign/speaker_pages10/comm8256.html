        <br>Title: A Multi-period Home Care Scheduling Problem with Work Balance</br><br>Author: Burcu Keskin, University of Alabama, Alston Hall, Box: 870226, Tuscaloosa, AL, 3587-0226, United States of America, bkeskin@cba.ua.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shirley (Rong) Li, Charles Schmidt</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a home health care  scheduling problem for a local hospital with multiple types of caregivers. We determine the assignment of caregivers to the patients visited at their homes so that the total routing costs are minimized and the workload of caregivers are balanced over a planning horizon while satisfying synchronization, precedence, loyalty, and other practical constraints. We present a MILP formulation and a branch-and-price solution approach based on Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition.</br>
