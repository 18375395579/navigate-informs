        <br>Title: Using Nested Partitions for Beam Angle Selection in Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy</br><br>Author: Hao Zhang, PhD Student, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, haoz@cae.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leyuan Shi, Warren D'Souza, Robert Meyer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Modern treatment technologies allow clinicians to develop complex treatment plans for a wide array of illnesses, including many forms of cancer. In this research we describe results obtained by applying the Nested Partitions (NP) metaheuristic to the problem of selecting beam angles for radiation delivery in Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). Our metaheuristic has led to significant reductions in treatment complexity and delivery time.</br>
