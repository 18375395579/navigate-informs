        <br>Title: Improving Patient Access to Chemotherapy Treatment at Duke Cancer Institute</br><br>Author: Brian Denton, Associate Professor, University of Michigan, 2893 IOE Building, 1205 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, btdenton@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tracy Gosselin, Amy Boswell, Johnathan Woodall, Edward P. Fitts</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We describe how discrete event simulation and optimization methods were used to improve patient flow within a large cancer center. First, we show results from the simulation model that indicate nurses in the chemotherapy infusion center are a significant bottleneck. Next, we describe a mixed integer program that was used to optimize weekly nurse shift scheduling, and how a simulation optimization model was further used to optimize nurse shift start times to minimize average patient waiting time. Finally we summarize the recommendations that were implemented at Duke Cancer Institute.</br>
