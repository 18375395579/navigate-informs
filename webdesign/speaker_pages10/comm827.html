        <br>Title: Dynamic Timing of Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) Creation for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients</br><br>Author: M. Reza Skandari, University of British Columbia, 2111 Lower Mall, #2052, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z4, Canada, reza.skandari@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nadia Zalunardo, Steven Shechter</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Periodic laboratory tests help nephrologists measure the progression of CKD and forecast when hemodialysis (HD) is needed. The superior quality access for HD is via AVF, which needs to be first created and reach maturity before use. We present a decision model that decides if and when to start creating AVF by dynamically updating our understanding of patient’s CKD progression based on observations. We then compare this dynamic approach with the best static policy.</br>
