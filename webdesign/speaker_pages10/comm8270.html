        <br>Title: Risk Identification, Assessment, and Monitoring in the Delivery of Health-care Services.</br><br>Author: Laila Cure, Graduate Student, University of South Florida, IMSE, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, ENB118, Tampa, Fl, 33620, United States of America, lncure@mail.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jose Zayas-Castro, Peter Fabri</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Patient safety research evidence the existence of risk beyond patient disease or chronic condition. This risk is intrinsic to the health-care delivery system and it is generally attributed to human error. We believe most incidents stem from substandard interactions of system components. We propose a methodology to combine expertise and near-miss reports to assess and monitor risk in health-care service delivery.</br>
