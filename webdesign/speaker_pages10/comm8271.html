        <br>Title: Link removal for stochastic epidemic control over networks</br><br>Author: Eva Enns, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street SE, Mmc 729, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, eenns@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Margaret Brandeau</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The control of infectious diseases spread through close contact often focuses on interrupting the contact network. We previously developed an optimal quarantining algorithm that disconnects the maximum number of susceptible nodes from infected ones given a constraint on the number of links that can be removed. We compare the performance of this and other link removal schemes in reducing the likelihood of an epidemic in a stochastic model of disease transmission through a fixed contact network.</br>
