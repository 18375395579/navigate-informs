        <br>Title: Admission Policies in a Neurological Hospital Ward</br><br>Author: Saied Samiedaluie, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, QC, H3A1G5, Canada, saied.samiedaluie@mail.mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Beste Kucukyazici, Dan Zhang, Vedat Verter</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we study patient admission policies in a neurological hospital ward, where there are multiple patient types with different medical characteristics. The patients need to wait in ED or ICU until a hospital bed is assigned to them. Each type of patient has different arrival rate, average length of stay and waiting cost. The problem is formulated as an average cost dynamic program over infinite horizon. An approximation scheme to solve the dynamic programming will be presented.</br>
