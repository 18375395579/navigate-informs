        <br>Title: Capacity Management and Patient Routine Decisions of an Intensive Care Unit with Step-down Units</br><br>Author: Lijian Lu, Columbia Business School, Uris Hall 4Q, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, ll2755@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Carri Chan, Linda Green</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the optimization of patient routine from an intensive care unit (ICU) when there are step-down units. We provide the characterization of the optimal routine policy and construct some easily implemented and efficient heuristics. We also propose a theoretic framework to optimize the capacities of variant inpatients units. The empirical data is used to calibrate the theoretical results.</br>
