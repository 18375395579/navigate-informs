        <br>Title: Cost-effectiveness of Mitigation Against Terrorist Release of a Toxic Industrial Chemical</br><br>Author: Anthony Barrett, Graduate Research Assistant, Doctoral Student, Carnegie Mellon University (Department of Engineering and Public Policy), 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15221, United States, tonybarrett@cmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Fatalities from terrorist release of a toxic industrial chemical under various conditions in an urban location, as well as reductions in fatalities from selected mitigation measures, are estimated using atmospheric dispersion and human effects models.  Mitigation costs are estimated and multi-criteria decision analysis of defense strategies is performed to find Pareto-optimal strategies and associated tradeoffs between mitigation costs and potential fatalities.</br>
