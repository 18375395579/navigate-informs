        <br>Title: Post-operative Destination Capacity Analysis</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Herrmann, University of Maryland, Department of Mechanical Engineering, College Park, MD, United States of America, jwh2@umd.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Predicting the demand for post-operative beds is an important task for identifying post-operative units that are facing bed shortages based on the current surgery schedule, evaluating how new operating rooms will increase bed demand, and estimating how changes to the block schedule will affect bed demand.  Our approach uses empirical length-of-stay distributions plus the current surgery schedule to estimate expected unit census.  These forecasts are better than other estimation methods.</br>
