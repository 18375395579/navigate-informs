        <br>Title: Clinical and Operational Drivers of Efficiency in an OPD: Non-stationarity, Variety, and Deadlines</br><br>Author: Sarang Deo, Indian School of Business, ISB Campus, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, 500032, India, Sarang_Deo@isb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Aditya Jain, Pradeep Pendem</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Using data from ~70,000 patient visits to a specialty eye care OPD in India, we estimate a dynamic panel model to understand how clinical and operational factors affect the average length of stay (LOS). We construct appropriate measures based on clinical codes to distinguish between clinical complexity and variety and find that both have a negative effect on LOS. We also find that average LOS increases with completed workload (fatigue) but decreases towards the end of the day (deadline effect).</br>
