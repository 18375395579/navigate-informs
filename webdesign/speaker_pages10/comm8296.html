        <br>Title: A Priori Performance of a Myopic Clinical Scheduling Policy</br><br>Author: Ayten Turkcan, Associate Research Scientist, Purdue University, e-Enterprise Center, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, aturkcan@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kumar Muthuraman, Mark Lawley</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A myopic clinical scheduling algorithm schedules patients at the time of their call without changing the previous appointment times and without considering the future calls. In this study, performance measures such as expected waiting time of patients, expected time in the system, variance in waiting times and time in system, queue length and utilization are determined a priori for a myopic clinical scheduling policy that considers patients with different no-show probabilities.</br>
