        <br>Title: Suboptimal Control Policies for Adaptive Radiotherapy</br><br>Author: Mustafa Sir, The University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2117, United States, msir@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Pollock, Marina A. Epelman</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Optimization-based planning for intensity-modulated radiotherapy often produces sharp dose gradients between tumors and healthy tissue. Random shifts can cause significant differences between the “optimized?plan and actual dose. It is now possible to measure variations in patient setup after each daily “fraction?of treatment. We exploit the dynamic nature of treatment and information gathering within a DP framework. Adaptive control policies provide considerable improvement over static plans.</br>
