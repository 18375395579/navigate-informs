        <br>Title: Evaluating the Efficacy of Household Control Strategies for TB in Areas of High HIV Prevalence</br><br>Author: Georgie Mellor, PhD Student, University of Southampton, School of Mathematics, Highfield, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom, G.R.Mellor@soton.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christine Currie, Russell Cheng, Elizabeth Corbett</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We describe a discrete event simulation model of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV disease parameterised to describe the dual epidemics in Harare, Zimbabwe. This model concentrates on modelling within-household and random transmission of TB and provides a way to explore the limits and potential impact of targeting households with a variety of case-finding strategies.</br>
