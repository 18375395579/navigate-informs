        <br>Title: Emergency Department Congestion - A Physician's Viewpoint</br><br>Author: Dave Eitel, York Hospital, Emergency Medicine, YH-1001 S. George St., York, PA, 17403, United States, daveitel@comcast.net</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Across the US, many patients who have been worked up and admitted to hospitals often have to remain in the Emergency Department for as long as 24 hours or longer on gurneys in ED hallways waiting for an available hospital bed. Unfortunately, this problem is worsening. As a practicing ED physician, I will share my perspective on how and why the ED has become a challenge to manage and provide insight into how we may improve the delivery of care in the ED and throughout the hospital setting.</br>
