        <br>Title: Modeling and Simulation of Sepsis: Explore the Therapeutic Agents in Intensive Care Unit</br><br>Author: Zhenzhen Shi, PhD student, Kansas State University, 2037 Durland Hall, Manhattan, KS, 66506, United States of America, szztracy@ksu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chih-Hang Wu, Songnian Zhao, David Ben-Arieh</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a system dynamics mathematical model and agent-based model, which model and simulate the basic components of innate immune response of Acute Inflammatory Response (AIR), the initial stage of sepsis. Results show different pathological situations of patients under various interventions of anti-inflammatory cytokines in AIR evolution. We also suggest a strategy for intervention of anti-inflammatory cytokines as potential therapeutic agents in the clinical settings.</br>
