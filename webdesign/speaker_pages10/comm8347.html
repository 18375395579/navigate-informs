        <br>Title: Treatment Planning for Radiofrequency Ablation of Liver Tumors</br><br>Author: Ariela Sofer, George Mason University, asofer@gmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In radiofrequency ablation, one or more needles are placed at the tumor site and generate heat.

We discuss solution approaches to the problem.</br>
