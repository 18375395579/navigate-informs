        <br>Title: A Hierarchical Aperture Shape Optimization Method for VMAT Treatment Planning</br><br>Author: Chunhua Men, PhD, Elekta, 13723 Riverport Drive, Suite 100, Maryland Heights, MO, 63043, United States of America, chunhua.men@elekta.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xiao Han</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) is a promising yet complex modern radiotherapy treatment technique. In this talk, we present a hierarchical aperture shape VMAT treatment plan optimization method in which an arbitrary deliverable aperture (e.g., beam-eye-view) is created at each control point, and each aperture is then modified using a two-step approach based on the “price?of each beamlet. Clinical tests show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method.</br>
