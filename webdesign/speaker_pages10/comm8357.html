        <br>Title: Fully Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials: Simultaneous Learning from Multiple Patients</br><br>Author: Vishal Ahuja</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Birge</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Abstract Clinical trials have traditionally followed a fixed design where allocation of patients to a given treatment is purely random. Such trials are static in the sense that a protocol is developed and executed with no modifications during the course of the trial. The primary goal of this traditional design is to maximize learning about the efficacy of treatments at the end of the trial. Adaptive designs, on the other hand, allow clinicians to learn about treatment effectiveness during the course of the trial. In an adaptive design, allocation of patients to treatments evolves dynamically as the trial progresses. An ideal adaptive design is one where patients are treated as effectively as possible without sacrificing potential learning and without compromising the integrity or the goals of the trial. We propose such an adaptive design, one that uses forward-looking algorithms to fully exploit learning from multiple patients simultaneously, a key contribution of this work. Compared to the best existing implementable design, we show that our proposed design improves patient outcomes by up to 8.6% under a set of considered scenarios. Further, we demonstrate our design's effectiveness using data from a recently conducted stent trial. Our design is general and applicable to any Markov decision process setting where learning takes place from multiple simultaneous individual experiments as, for example, in customized consumer offers, dynamic retail assortment, and worker retention and hiring.</br>
