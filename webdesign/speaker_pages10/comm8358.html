        <br>Title: A Simulation-based Peri-operative Decision Support System</br><br>Author: Daphne Sniekers, PhD Candidate, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, sniekers@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mike Carter</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this study, a simulation tool was created which models the flow of patients through the entire preoperative process; from decision to perform to discharge from the recovery ward. The model will allow users to test varying scenarios such as increased orthopedic block times, on the daily bed census, PACU overload, ward bed availability, and cancellation rates. The model is being piloted at two sites, and is part of a larger project of developing a general framework for a perioperative DSS.</br>
