First, hormonal contraceptives are very common have recently been shown to double the risk of HIV.  We look at the births, HIV transmission, and mother-to-child transmission under various scenarios of contraceptive substitution.  Second, a fraction of HIV-1 type C infections have high viral loads for an extended duration.  These individuals are more infectious and have a shorter life span.  We discuss their impact on the HIV epidemic.</br>
