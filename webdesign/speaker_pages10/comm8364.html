        <br>Title: Modeling the Effect of Transients on Flu Epidemics in Washington, D.C.</br><br>Author: Mina Youssef, Postdoctoral Research Associate, Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory, Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, Virginia Tech, 1880 Pratt Drive, Research Building XV, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, mkamel@ksu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Samarth Swarup, Stephen Eubank, Nidhi Parikh</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We build a synthetic population model of transient and resident populations in Washington DC and study the impact of transients on flu epidemics. We focus interventions on reducing disease spread in major tourist destinations, which can have 80,000 visits per day. Surprisingly, promoting practices to reduce disease spread (such as hand sanitizer use) is more effective than closing down the museums entirely. We also present an explicit form of the reproductive number and a stability analysis.</br>
