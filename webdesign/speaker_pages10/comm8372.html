        <br>Title: Evaluating a Proposed Discharge Unit using a Simulation Based on Clinical Length of Stay</br><br>Author: Louis Luangkesorn, Research Assistant Professor, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, 3700 O'Hara St, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States of America, lol11@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Kilinc, Yasin Ulukus, Andrew Schaefer, Gilles Clermont</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In an effort to reduce costs, many hospitals have reduced the numbers of available in-patient beds. One alternative policy for reducing congestion is to establish a discharge center which can more efficiently process standard discharge of in-patients and thereby free beds for use by other patients.  We evaluate the usefulness of a discharge model through the adaptation of a patient flow simulation model of an entire hospital.</br>
