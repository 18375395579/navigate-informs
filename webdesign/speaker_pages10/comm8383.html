        <br>Title: An Optimization Model for Metabolic Pathways</br><br>Author: J E Beasley, Brunel University, Mathematical Sciences, Uxbridge, United Kingdom, John.Beasley@brunel.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): F Planes</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present an integer-programming based optimisation model for metabolic pathways. Given a source compound, and a target compound, this model is capable of recovering the complete experimentally determined pathway reported in the literature. Computational results are reported for 40 metabolic pathways associated with E. Coli.</br>
