        <br>Title: Sequential Monitoring of Glaucoma Patients</br><br>Author: Mariel Lavieri, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, 2783 IOE, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, lavieri@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gregg Schell, Mark Van Oyen, Joshua Stein, MD, David Musch, Jonathan Helm</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We develop novel algorithms to determine the best Time to Next Test based on each patient's individual disease trajectory. Our algorithms integrate a dynamic linear Gaussian systems model of disease progression with optimization approaches to predict the likelihood of glaucoma progression. We will present our closed form solutions and discuss the structural properties of the algorithms. Our work has been validated using patient data from a large–scale glaucoma clinical trial.</br>
