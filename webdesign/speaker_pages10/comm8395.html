        <br>Title: Optimal Allocation of Operating Room Time between Surgical Specialties</br><br>Author: Stephanie Carew, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada, stephanie.carew@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mahesh Nagarajan, Steven Shechter</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We examine how to allocate operating room hours to different surgical specialties at the British Columbia Children’s Hospital. This is a longer-run planning decision which has major effects on the wait time experience of the patient population. To evaluate policies, we construct and validate a simulation model of patient arrival and appointment processes. We then apply optimization and dynamic programming techniques to recommend improved allocation policies.</br>
