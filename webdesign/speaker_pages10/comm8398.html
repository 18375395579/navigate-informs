        <br>Title: Statistical Methods to Support Microsimulations of Anemia Reduction Interventions in Rural China</br><br>Author: Diana Negoescu, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America, negoescu@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Marcos Vera-Hernández, Grant Miller, Sean Sylvia, Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert, Renfu Luo</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Biomarkers predict disease risk and are potential intervention targets. They present modeling challenges because they are often non-Gaussian distributed, correlated with other individual characteristics, evolving over time with non-linear dependencies on their covariates, and related non-linearly to multiple health outcomes. We develop appropriate estimation procedures and apply them in a microsimulation of hemoglobin and anemia-related outcomes in rural Chinese schoolchildren.</br>
