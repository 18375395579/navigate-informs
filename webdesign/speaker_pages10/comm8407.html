        <br>Title: A Case Study of a Simulation-Based Decision Support Tool for Surgical Scheduling</br><br>Author: Michael Carter, Professor, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G8, Canada, carter@mie.utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hai Ein (Jean) Yong</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A simulation tool was developed to determine the surgical booking policy for allocating caediac operating room time.  In practice, it was rather difficult to get the surgeons and the managers to quantitatively describe the current processes.  Much of the effort on the project was focused on translating practice into a set of rules that could then be used to predict future behaviour.</br>
