        <br>Title: Optimal Design of the Annual Influenza Vaccine with Manufacturing Autonomy</br><br>Author: Osman Ozaltin, Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada, oozaltin@uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, Oleg Prokopyev</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Seasonal influenza is a major public health concern, and the first line of defense is the flu shot. We propose a bilevel multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer program that maximizes societal benefit of the flu shot under autonomous profit maximizing manufacturers. Calibrated over publicly available data, our model returns the optimal flu shot composition and timing in a stochastic and dynamic environment. We derive analytical results, and perform extensive numerical experiments.</br>
