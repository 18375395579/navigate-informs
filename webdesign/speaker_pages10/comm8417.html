        <br>Title: Scheduling Low-Acuity Patients in Emergency Department</br><br>Author: Shengyong Wang, Research Assistant Professor, Department of Systems Science & Industrial Engineering, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, 13902, United States of America, wangs@binghamton.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Traditionally, Emergency Department (ED) does not operate based on appointments. While most low-acuity patients experience prolonged waiting time before being seen by a physician, mainly due to bed availability, they have some flexibility on their arrival time to the ED. Aiming at creating a balanced system and improving the patients¡¯ experience at the ED, a mathematical model combining historical trends and real-time information is established to schedule low-acuity patients at ED.</br>
