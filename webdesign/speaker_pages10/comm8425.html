        <br>Title: An MDP Model of the Optimal Time to Initiate HIV Therapy as a Function of Two Variables</br><br>Author: Steven Shechter, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada, steven.shechter@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Roberts, Andrew Schaefer, Matthew Bailey, Scott Braithwaite</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: National guidelines policies for the best time to initiate HIV therapy consider two primary measures of HIV infection: the CD4 blood cell count and the level of HIV virus in the blood.  We present a MDP model that considers both factors in a two-dimensional state space and develop structural properties in this context.  For example, we present conditions that lead to a two-dimensional version of a control-limit policy.  We also discuss the use of real clinical data to solve the MDP model.</br>
