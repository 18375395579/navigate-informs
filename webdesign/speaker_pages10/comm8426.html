        <br>Title: Evaluating the Impact of Performance Goals on Emergency Medical Service Dispatching Decisions</br><br>Author: Laura McLay, Virginia Commonwealth University, Statistics & Operations Research, 1015 Floyd Ave, Box 843083, Richmond, VA, 23284, United States of America, lamclay@vcu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Maria Mayorga</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Emergency medical services measure performance based on response time thresholds, i.e., the proportion of calls responded to within a fixed timeframe. The ultimate goal of emergency medical services is to save lives, which suggests that it might be worthwhile to consider using performance measures more closely tied to patient outcomes. This paper examines how different response time threshold performance goals impact patient survival rates in the context of emergency medical dispatch.</br>
