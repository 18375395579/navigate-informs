        <br>Title: Simulation Optimization of the Screening and Treatment Decisions for Prostate Cancer</br><br>Author: Daniel Underwood, North Carolina State University, 111 Lampe Drive, 373 Daniels Hall, Campus Box 7906, Raleigh, NC, 27695, United States of America, daniel.underwood@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jingyu Zhang, Brian Denton</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present a simulation-optimization model for finding near optimal strategies for prostate cancer screening, including decisions related to screening by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and treatment by radical prostatectomy. We discuss a customized implementation of COMPASS for solving our problem. Results from the COMPASS algorithm are compared to results from a previously published method based on a genetic algorithm. We present results, based on longitudinal data for a large North American population, to study the influence of personalized risk factors on individualized PSA-based screening policies.</br>
