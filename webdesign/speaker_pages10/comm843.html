Organizational risk considered are the ability to take risk (length of stay of patients), the outsourced risk (malpractice insurance taken), and the realized risk (ratio of expected to actual mortality rate, and ratio of expected to actual complication rate). Using data from 47 hospitals from 1998 to 2001, we found that IT has differential impacts on organizational risk.</br>
