        <br>Title: Algorithmic Prediction of Health Care Costs and Discovery of Medical Knowledge</br><br>Author: Margret Bjarnadottir, MIT, 77 Mass Ave., MIT E40-149, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, margret@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Grant Wang, Michael Kane, J. Christian Kryder, Dimitris Bertsimas, Rudra Pandey, Santosh Vempala</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Rising health care costs are one of the world's most important problems. Correspondingly, predicting such costs with accuracy is a significant first step in addressing this problem. We utilize modern data mining methods and claims data from close to 400,000  members over three years, to provide a)rigorously validated predictions of health care cost  and b) an illustration through two examples,  that our methods can lead to discovery of medical knowledge.</br>
