        <br>Title: Sequential Clinical Scheduling with Patient Re-entrant: The Case of Skin Cancer Surgery</br><br>Author: Haolin Feng, Lingnan College, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, FengHaoL@mail.sysu.edu.cn</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stephen Steidle, Seokcheon Lee, Mark Lawley</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Mohs Micrographic Surgery is a popular skin cancers excision method yielding low recurrence rate and positive cosmetic results. It repetitively removes one skin layer at a time until a cancer free layer is found, and this brings same-day patient re-entrants. Currently patients often experience long in-clinic waiting due to the stochastic nature of layer removals. We develop a sequential scheduling scheme to improve patient experience and clinic revenues. Numerical study shows great improvements.</br>
