        <br>Title: Short-Term Adjustment of Nurse Schedules Using Branch and Price</br><br>Author: Jonathan Bard, Professor, The University of Texas, 1 University Station C2200, Mechanical Engineering, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, jbard@mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hadi Purnomo</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In most hospitals, the nursing staff is given a midterm schedule that specifies their daily work assignments. Emergencies, call-outs, and normal fluctuations in personnel requirements, though, can play havoc with the schedule. As a result, it is necessary to make short-term adjustments, either by reallocating resources when shortages exist or by canceling assignments when demand drops. This problem is formulated as an integer program  and solved with a branch-and-price algorithm.</br>
