        <br>Title: Cancer Treatment Optimization</br><br>Author: Kyungduck Cha, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, chacha2000@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Eva Lee</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We will present a Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming approach for treatment planning optimization in radiation therapy. Two significant computational advances will be highlighted: 1) drastic improvement of solution time to previously intractable large-scale and dense QP instances; and 2) rapid column-generation approach where candidate beams are selected adaptively and dynamically.</br>
