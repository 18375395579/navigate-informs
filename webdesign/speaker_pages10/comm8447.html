        <br>Title: Optimizing Patient Treatment Decisions in An Era of Rapid Technological Advances</br><br>Author: Shan Liu, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, Industrial & Systems Engineering, University of Washington, Box 352650, Seattle, WA, 98195-2650, United States of America, shanliu@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert, Margaret Brandeau</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: How long should a patient with a treatable chronic disease wait for more effective treatments before accepting the best available treatment? We explore this question as an optimal stopping problem using a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov Decision Process. We derive structural properties of the model, solve a three-period problem and present a numerical example of chronic hepatitis C optimal treatment adoption decisions.</br>
