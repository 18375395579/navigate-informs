        <br>Title: The Economics of Nosocomial Infection Controls in Hospitals</br><br>Author: Reidar Hagtvedt, hagtvedt@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Griffin, Pinar Keskinocak</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine the economics of strategies to control nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections. Data from one hospital, combined with results from the literature, provide the basis for a simulation of the incidence of nosocomial infections. This model allows costs and benefits of different approaches of infection control to be assessed.</br>
