In the meantime EMS providers aim for better medical service. EMS team planning (EMS-TP) enables EMS service providers to monitor their past performance, and moreover enables providers to predict call volumes and the number of ambulances needed at each base location for half an hour time intervals. EMS-TP is currently being deployed by a large Dutch EMS provider.</br>
