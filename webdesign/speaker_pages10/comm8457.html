        <br>Title: A Stochastic Optimization Approach to Adaptive Lung Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning</br><br>Author: Troy Long, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Avenue, Room 1791, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, troylong@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edwin Romeijn, Marina Epelman, Martha Matuszak</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Biomarker data obtained during treatment has been shown to be predictive of a patient's predisposition to radiation induced lung toxicity (RILT). We develop a two-stage stochastic treatment plan optimization model to explicitly consider future patient-specific biomarker data. Two adaptive strategies are studied: bounding the expected proportion of the entire population that will experience RILT, and bounding the probability that each individual patient will experience RILT.</br>
