        <br>Title: Equilibrium Stability vs Payoff Efficiency in Prearranged Paired Kidney Exchanges</br><br>Author: Murat Kurt, Assistant Professor, University at Buffalo, SUNY, University at Buffalo, North Campus, 415 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, muratkur@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Roberts, Utku Unver, Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Paired kidney exchanges (PKE) alleviate the shortage in the supply of kidneys for transplantation. We model patients' transplant timing decisions in a PKE as a stochastic game and address the trade-off between the payoff efficiency and the stability of the equilibria against patients?joint deviations. To characterize a socially efficient stable equilibrium, we formulate an MILP representation of the resulting  equilibrium conditions. We present computational results using clinical data.</br>
