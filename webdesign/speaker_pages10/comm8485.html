        <br>Title: Coordination Strategies in Blood Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Paronkasom Indradat, PhD Student, Pennsylvania State University, Department of  Industrial and Manufactur, 310 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, pxi5005@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Paul Griffin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Discrete event simulation models are developed to compare the implementation of vendor managed and recycle policies for the distribution of red blood cells between blood centers and hospitals.  Experimental results show that the proposed strategies outperform the baseline by reducing the number of outdates by up to 70%. Further, the order quantities can be reduced by up to 67% without increasing the number of shortages.</br>
