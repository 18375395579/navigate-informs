        <br>Title: Empowering Individuals and Families to Prepare for Public Health Emergencies</br><br>Author: Stan Finkelstein, MIT, 1 Amherst Street, E40-251, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, snf@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Larson, Shiva Prakash</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Vaccines and medicines may have limited value in flu pandemics. Non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the risk of household members becoming sick. Interventions range from hygiene measures to home-based technologies to process indoor air or regulate its temperature and humidity. Published literature suggests these interventions can be effective. Adopting them requires only modest effort and monetary investment and could reduce the pandemic's impact.</br>
