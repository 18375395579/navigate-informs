        <br>Title: A POMDP Model for Optimizing Mammography Screening for Breast Cancer</br><br>Author: Turgay Ayer, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1513 University Ave., Mechanical Eng. Building, Madison, WI, United States of America, tayer@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oguzhan Alagoz</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: There is strong evidence that current screening policies for early detection of breast cancer, the most common cancer affecting women in the US, are suboptimal. We develop a finite-horizon partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) model for mammography screening. We optimally solve this POMDP using real data. Unlike current clinical guidelines, our POMDP model provides a personalized screening strategy for women.</br>
