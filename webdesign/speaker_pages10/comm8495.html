        <br>Title: Developing Non-pharmaceutical Intervention Strategies for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation</br><br>Author: Tapas Das, Professor, Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida, Industrial Engineering, Tampa, FL, United States of America, das@usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dayna Martinez</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: In this paper we examine the interactions between the parameters of virus epidemiology, social behavior, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This examination is conducted using an agent-based simulation model and designed statistical experiments. Results are used to design effective NPI strategies for pandemic influenza mitigation. Some numerical results are presented for various virus transmissibility scenarios.</br>
