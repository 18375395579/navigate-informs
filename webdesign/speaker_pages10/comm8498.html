        <br>Title: A Dynamic Approach to the Dose Optimization in Radiotherapy</br><br>Author: Minsun Kim, Student, University of Washington, 1959 N.E. Pacific, Seattle, WA, United States of America, mk688@u.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Archis Ghate, Mark Phillips</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We propose a novel treatment planning strategy that dynamically includes patients?radiobiological responses.  The dose delivery is thus optimized not only spatially as in IMRT but also temporally.  Preliminary results for simplified scenarios will be presented.</br>
