        <br>Title: An Analysis of the Pediatric Vaccine Supply Shortage Problem</br><br>Author: Sheldon Jacobson, Professor, University of Illinois, 201 N. Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edward Sewell, Ruben Proano</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The impact of pediatric vaccine stockpile levels on immunization coverage rates is analyzed. The results suggest that the CDC/HHS proposed vaccine stockpile levels are adequate for production interruptions that last no more than six months. However, given that recent production interruptions have lasted (on average) for over one year, the proposed stockpile levels are insufficient during such time periods, which in turn could lead to disease outbreaks.</br>
