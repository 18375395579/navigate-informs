        <br>Title: Strategic Block Scheduling Optimization in Large Academic Medical Centers</br><br>Author: Retsef Levi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 100 Main Street, Building E62-562, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, retsef@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Timothy Carnes, Bethany Daily, Peter Dunn, Sue Moss, Devon Price, Ana Cecilia Zenteno Langle</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) is a large academic hospital that makes use of over fifty operating rooms. Currently the inpatient beds have peak usage in the middle of the week, and are under-utilized on other days. Using an integer programming model to find a feasible adjustment to the surgical block schedule, we are able to find a solution such that the predicted use of inpatient beds is level-loaded, providing an effective increase in capacity.</br>
