        <br>Title: Automatic Medication Reconciliation</br><br>Author: Sharique Hasan, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, shasanx@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): George Duncan, Rema Padman, Daniel Neill</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: To reduce medication errors, JCAHO recommends medication reconciliation for creating a more accurate list of a patient’s medications. We develop automatic techniques for medication reconciliation, particularly detection of omissions in medication lists, identifying drugs that the patient may be taking but are not on the patient’s medication list. Our key insight is that this problem is analogous to the collaborative filtering framework used by online retailers to recommend relevant products.</br>
