        <br>Title: The Bed Manager’s Dilemma: A Dynamic Bed Assignment Problem</br><br>Author: Jacqueline Griffin, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America, jackie.griffin@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pinar Keskinocak</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A bed manager balances available capacity with competing requests for beds, accounting for clinical characteristics of the patients and expectations about future supply and demand.  We identify structural properties of the bed assignment problem, by modeling the hospital system as a tandem queueing network with multiple customer classes and cross-trained server pools.  We develop algorithms for dynamic assignments and test the performance against current hospital practices through simulation.</br>
