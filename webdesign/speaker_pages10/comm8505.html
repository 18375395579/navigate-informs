        <br>Title: Applications of GIS, Mathematical and Simulation Models for Optimal Organ Allocation System</br><br>Author: Naoru Koizumi, Assoc. Professor, George Mason University, 3351 N. Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA, 22201, United States of America, nkoizumi@gmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rajesh Ganesan, Amit Patel, Chun-Hung Chen, Monica Gentili, Nigel Waters, Keith Melancon, Debasree DasGupta, Dennis Nicholas, Divya Srinivasan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study combined GIS, mathematical modeling and discrete event simulation to analyze geographic equity and efficiency of the US liver allocation system. The main objectives of the study were to: (i) identify key factors determining geographic disparity; (ii) identify optimal locations of existing and new liver transplant centers; (iii) identify new allocation boundaries, and (iv) test whether the mathematically produced liver allocation system can perform better than the actual system.</br>
