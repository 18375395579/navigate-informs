        <br>Title: Patient Preference in Appointment Scheduling: Insights from a Discrete Choice Experiment</br><br>Author: Nan Liu, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America, nl2320@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stacey Finkelstein, Margaret Kruk</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Online appointment scheduling has been becoming increasingly popular among patients and providers. Understanding patient preference in medical appointments is crucial in managing such appointment systems. In this study we designed and conducted a discrete choice experiment to elicit patient preference in a large urban community health center. Our study generates insights on how patients choose appointments when facing multiple alternatives, and what factors drive patients to make such choices.</br>
