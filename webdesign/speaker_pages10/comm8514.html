        <br>Title: Optimal Health Program Intervention with Information Acquisition</br><br>Author: Lauren Cipriano, Stanford University, Huang Engineering Center, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, cipriano@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Weber</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a cohort-specific health-intervention decision as an optimal stopping problem. Across successive periods a given age cohort’s imperfectly observable disease prevalence evolves randomly. To inform the stopping decision it is possible to collect a costly sample, the size of which is subject to optimization. We determine an optimal program-continuation and information-collection policy and, as application, propose an optimal testing program for hepatitis C at routine medical visits.</br>
