        <br>Title: Modeling HIV Testing Options in the Emergency Department Setting</br><br>Author: Teresa Kauf, Associate Professor, University of Florida, PO Box 100496, Gainesville, FL, 32610-0496, United States of America, kauf@cop.ufl.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends routine HIV testing in all health care settings.  Yet, existing cost-effectiveness analyses have not considered the perspective of specific providers, such as emergency departments (EDs), when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of testing. This paper uses decision analysis to compare the cost-effectiveness of HIV testing from the perspective of an ED and the overall health care system.  Barriers to efficient testing are discussed.</br>
