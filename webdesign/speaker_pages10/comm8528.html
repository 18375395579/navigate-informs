        <br>Title: How Often Should Liver Transplant Patients Update Their MELD Scores?</br><br>Author: Atul Bhandari, Post-Doctoral Associate, University of Pittsburgh, 1178c Benedum Hall, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, abhandari79@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Lisa Maillart, Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: UNOS requires liver transplant patients to update their MELD scores at least as often as a predetermined frequency associated with their last recorded scores. We consider a time cost of updating and determine the policy that maximizes the expected net lifetime. The policy prescribes when to check or report scores, and which liver types to accept in each state. We model the problem as a partially observable MDP, establish structural properties, and conduct numerical studies using clinical data.</br>
