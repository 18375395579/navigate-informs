        <br>Title: Internal Medicine Residency Scheduling at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign College of Medicine</br><br>Author: David Morrison, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 201 N Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL, United States of America, morris50@illinois.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The residency scheduling problem (RSP) is faced by hospitals around the country; medical residents must be assigned to rotations to satisfy coverage constraints and other side constraints. Currently, no prescriptive computational tools exist to aid in schedule generation; thus, schedules are created by hand. This project describes RESIDENT, the first computational tool to solve RSP, using integer programming techniques.</br>
