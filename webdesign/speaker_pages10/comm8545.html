        <br>Title: Iterative Characterization of Stable Equilibria for the Timing of Paired Kidney Exchanges</br><br>Author: Murat Kurt, Assistant Professor, University at Buffalo, SUNY, University at Buffalo, North Campus, 415 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States of America, muratkur@buffalo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Utku Unver, Mark Roberts, Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Paired kidney exchanges (PKE), overcomes many difficulties in matching patients with incompatible donors. We consider a stochastic game formulation to model the transplant timing decisions in a two-way prearranged PKE. For large scale problems, we develop a convergent iterative algorithm to characterize a stable equilibrium of the game.  We use clinical data to illustrate computational efficiency of the algorithm to equilibrium characterization through MILP and compare policy outcomes.</br>
