        <br>Title: Machine Learning for Beam Angle Selection in Radiotherapy</br><br>Author: Robert R. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, 1210 W. Dayton, Madison, WI, 53706-1685, United States of America, rrm@cs.wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leyuan Shi, Warren D'Souza, Hao Howard Zhang, Siyang Gao</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: An important element of radiation treatment planning for cancer therapy is the selection for a given patient of a set of 5-9 incident radiation beam angles. The quality of a treatment plan may be scored by a piecewise-linear function that measures the deviation from desirable doses for the tumor and surrounding organs. Machine learning tools are used to predict the score components for beam sets in conjunction with a Nested Partitions framework for this global optimization problem.</br>
