        <br>Title: Web Services Adaptation in the Presence of Business Protocol Evolution</br><br>Author: Maryam Eslamichalandar, PhD Candidate, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM), Cédric - Groupe Vespa, 2 Rue Cont? Paris, 75141, France, mechalandar@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hamid Reza Motahari-Nezhad, Kamel Barkaoui</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: A fundamental challenge in interoperability of heterogeneous Web services is compatibility. In the context of Web service interaction via adapters, it is significant to cope with potential impacts of the evolution of service business protocol on the adapter. We propose an approach to automatically identify the impacts of changes and to dynamically update the adapter. Besides, experimental results of a prototype tool show the benefits of approach compared to static adapter regeneration methods.</br>
