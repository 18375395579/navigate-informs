        <br>Title: Role of Demand Variability, Information Sharing & Resource Flexibility in Coordinating Patient Flow</br><br>Author: Vikram Tiwari, Assistant Professor & Director Surgical Business Analytics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States of America, vikram.tiwari@Vanderbilt.Edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Munirpallam Venkataramanan, Kurt Bretthauer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Using simulation modeling, patient flows in a hospital are analyzed under varying levels of information sharing, demand variability and resource flexibilities. It is found that increasing levels of information sharing can sometimes be to the detriment of operational performance, especially if the system has too much built-in resource flexibility.</br>
