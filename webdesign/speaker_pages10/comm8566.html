        <br>Title: Random Effects ANOVA for Testing Heterogeneity of Brownian Motion Cancer Growth</br><br>Author: Gordon Hazen, Professor, Northwestern University, IEMS Department, McCormick School of Enginering, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, gbh305@northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Neehar Parikh, Talia Baker, Daniel Apley</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of liver cancer when transplant is an option. Deterministic growth models based on ODEs are unsuitable for decision analytic modeling where future growth is uncertain and growth is heterogeneous. Instead, we fit geometric Brownian motion to natural history data for liver cancer, and adapt variance component models to test heterogeneity across data sources and patients. The fitted model allows for adaptive choice of treatment based on growth history.</br>
