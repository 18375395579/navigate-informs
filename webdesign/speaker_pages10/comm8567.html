        <br>Title: An Enhanced Triage System for Emergency Departments</br><br>Author: Soroush Saghafian, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States of America, soroush.saghafian@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Van Oyen, Jeffrey Desmond, Steven Kronick, Wallace Hopp</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We propose a new triage system for hospital emergency departments that incorporates patient complexity as well as urgency. Using a combination of analytic and simulation models calibrated with hospital data, we demonstrate that the new triage system can substantially improve both patient safety and operational efficiency in emergency departments. We also investigate new patient flow designs as well as priority systems that can further improve the performance of Emergency Departments.</br>
