        <br>Title: Beam Orientation Optimization in Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning</br><br>Author: Troy Long, Student, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave., Room 1791, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States of America, troylong@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edwin Romeijn</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Beam orientation optimization selects stationary beam positions to produce a both high quality and efficiently deliverable treatment plan, resulting in a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem. We study an efficient method for selecting beam orientations for IMRT treatments that explicitly incorporates the quality of the resulting optimal dose distribution.</br>
