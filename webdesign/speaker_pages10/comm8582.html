        <br>Title: Challenges in Training Cardio Thoracic Transplant Surgeons</br><br>Author: Amy Cohn, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America, amycohn@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rishindra Reddy, Mark Daskin</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Surgical residents training to become heart-lung transplant surgeons must perform a sufficient number of transplants during their residency/fellowship to become certified. There is an inherent conflict between the time required to do so (along with the underlying stochasticity of transplant arrivals and durations)versus the regulations that limit trainees' work hours. We quantify this conflict and propose alternative approaches.</br>
