        <br>Title: Determining Case-Mix under a New DRG System: An Application of Mixture Models</br><br>Author: Adam C. Powell, PhD Candidate, The Wharton School, Leonard Davis Institute of Health Econ., University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, apowell@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chris P. Lee</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Diagnosis-Related Group system was revised in 2007 to expand the classification of disease severity levels. Hospitals want to forecast their patients' classification because it significantly impacts their revenue, but historical claims were not always recorded with the information needed. We build a model to forecast classification and hospitals' revenue loss due to the imperfect documentation in patient claims. We also develop a strategy to help hospitals negotiate pricing with insurers.</br>
