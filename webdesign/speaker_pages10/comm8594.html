        <br>Title: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center - 2012 INFORMS Prize Winning  Organization</br><br>Author: Sasha Bartashnik, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 405 Lexington Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, NY, 10174, United States of America, bartasha@mskcc.org</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) is the oldest and one of the largest cancer hospitals in the world - over 25,000 patients come to MSK for treatment every year. The changing health care landscape presents a unique challenge for hospital administrators in providing better quality care at lower cost. Increasing demand against tighter resource constraints reinforces the institution's focus on their  mission: better outcomes for patients. These challenges, as well as MSK's high volume of longitudinal care, create an opportunity to develop a fundamental platform for using quantitative methods to gain operational, strategic, and clinical insights. In 2006 MSK established the department of Strategic Planning and Innovation (STPI) based on the idea that better patient care means finding financially sustainable, patient-centered solutions. By working at the intersection of leadership, clinical staff, and physicians, STPI integrates OR/MS concepts within the hospital. Quantitative analysis, industrial engineering and design research teams collaborate to find innovative approaches to some of the hospital's most difficult challenges, including improving process flow, modeling resource utilization, and introducing a volume forecasting system. MSK continues to push the frontiers of cancer care as it partners with IBM to use powerful machine learning technology to develop a comprehensive evidence-based medical intelligence engine.</br>
