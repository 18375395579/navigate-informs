        <br>Title: Error Minimization in Healthcare Settings Through the Dynamic Analysis of Near-misses</br><br>Author: Jose Zayas-Castro, Professor & Chair, University of South Florida, 4202 E Fowler Avenue, Industrial Engineering Department, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, josezaya@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laila Cure, Peter Fabri</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: There are about 98,000 annual U.S. deaths due to medical errors.  The potential to reduce this error exists by conducting systematic analysis of near-misses. A dynamic methodology is proposed to report, classify and analyze near-misses to then assess the likelihood of the occurrence of errors and trigger a timely alarm.</br>
