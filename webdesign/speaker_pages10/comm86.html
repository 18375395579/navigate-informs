        <br>Title: Applying Text Mining to Find Optimal Treatment Pathways</br><br>Author: Patricia Cerrito, Professor of Mathematics, Univ. of Louisville, Department of Mathematics, Louisville, KY, 40292, United States, pcerrito@louisville.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Patients with diabetes require physicians to make a sequence of decisions to treat diabetic foot ulcers and bone infections. Physicians can choose between combinations of antibiotics, amputations, and standard wound care. Text mining is used to compress categories of patient diagnoses and treatment combinations. Survival data mining algorithms are applied to examine multiple patient events. Results indicate that the primary treatment is amputation and that antibiotics are under-utilized.</br>
