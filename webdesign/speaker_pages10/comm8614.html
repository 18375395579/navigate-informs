        <br>Title: Control Charts for Monitoring Peak Expiratory Flow for Asthma Diagnosis</br><br>Author: Amit Mitra, Professor, Auburn University, College of Business, 419 Lowder Building, Auburn, AL, 36849-5266, United States of America, mitraam@auburn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jayprakash Patankar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Common measures for asthma diagnosis involve peak expiratory flow or forced expiratory volume in one second as indicators of lung function. In this paper, statistical control charts for monitoring peak expiratory flow, obtained from individual samples, over a time period are developed. The proposed control charts are unique to the health care field.</br>
