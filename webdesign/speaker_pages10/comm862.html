        <br>Title: Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Disease Co-epidemics with Application to the HIV and Tuberculosis Co-epidemics in India</br><br>Author: Elisa Long, PhD Student, Department of Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, 467 Terman Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States</br><br>Coauthor(s): Margaret Brandeau, Naveen Vaidya</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Infectious disease co-epidemics involve the related spread of two or more diseases. We present two mathematical models of co-epidemics, including calculations of the basic reproduction number and stability analysis of equilibrium points.  We simulate the HIV-TB co-epidemics in India and evaluate the effects of various treatment and prevention programs on disease prevalence, new infections, and deaths over time.
