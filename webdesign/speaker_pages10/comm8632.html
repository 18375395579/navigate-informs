        <br>Title: Optimal Allocation of HIV Prevention and Treatment Resources</br><br>Author: Elisa Long, PhD Candidate, Stanford University, 467 Terman Engineering Center, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States, elisa46@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Margaret Brandeau, Douglas Owens</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Given a limited budget, the optimal resource allocation among competing HIV prevention and treatment programs can depend on local epidemic factors, such as disease prevalence and the primary transmission modes. We aimed to determine an efficient allocation of funds among interventions including HIV screening, antiretrovirals, preventive and therapeutic vaccines, and male circumcision, and across multiple risk groups. We present our epidemic and economic model and discuss our empirical findings.</br>
