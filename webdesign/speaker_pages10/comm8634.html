        <br>Title: Optimal Hospital-acquired Infection Control Considering Health Care Workers?Strategic Behavior</br><br>Author: Wenlin Chen, PhD Candidate, Australian School of Business, University of New South Wales, 215A Anzac Parade Kensington, Sydney, 2052, Australia, wenlin.chen@student.unsw.edu.au</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chung-Li Tseng, Sunny Shu-Jung Yang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Although hospitals require health care workers (HCWs) to wash hands in every hand hygiene opportunity, literature suggests that HCWs decide hand hygiene adherence strategically.  We develop a game-theoretic model that integrates infection transmission dynamics and HCWs?strategic hand hygiene behavior. The model sheds light on hospitals?optimal infection control strategy that minimizes the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and HCWs opportunistic behavior.</br>
