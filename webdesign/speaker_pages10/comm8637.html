        <br>Title: Disbursement of Medical Supplies for Biological Emergencies</br><br>Author: Fernando Ordonez, Assistant Professor, University of Southern California, 3715 McClintock Avenue, GER-240, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, fordon@usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hongzhong Jia, Maged Dessouky, Zhihong Shen</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: A response to biological emergencies considers the delivery of federal push packages of medical supplies to meet the surge in demand.  We investigate how to efficiently disburse these supplies from a local site to points of dispensing, where the population receives treatment.  We separate the problem into a facility location and routing problems that incorporate the uncertainty present in emergencies and show the benefits of this formulation on an example of a mass vaccination in LA County.</br>
