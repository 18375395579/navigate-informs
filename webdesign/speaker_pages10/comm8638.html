        <br>Title: A Nonparametric Method for Patient-specific Forecasting of Kidney Transplant and Waitlist Survival</br><br>Author: David Lowsky, PhD Candidate, Stanford Graduate School of Business, 518 Memorial Way, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, Lowsky_Dave@GSB.Stanford.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stefanos Zenios, Donald Lee, Lainie Ross, J. Richard Thistlethwaite, Charles E. McCulloch</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a new nonparametric method for generating patient-specific survival distributions at the time of kidney transplantation or addition to the transplant waitlist, based on a K-nearest neighbors approach.  Separate forecasts are generated for each donor scenario (living, SCD, ECD).  The method can be used by patients and physicians as a decision-support tool to compare treatment options. Predictive accuracy results are presented.</br>
