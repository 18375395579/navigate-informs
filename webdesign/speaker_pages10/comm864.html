        <br>Title: Models to Predict the Duration of Surgical Cases</br><br>Author: Polly Biyu He, bhe@stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stefanos Zenios, Alex Macarios</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We have analyzed data from more than 30,000 surgical cases in order to develop probabilistic models for the duration of surgery. For each case, the data provided a mnemonic code indicating the type of surgery and the surgeon. We have used partial least squares to collapse 1903 different mnemonics and 369 surgeons into 10 latent variables and then regressed the logarithm of the duration on these variables. Predictions based on these regression models improved prediction accuracy by 7.8% relative to three other commonly used models.</br>
