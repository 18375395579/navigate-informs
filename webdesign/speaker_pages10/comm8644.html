        <br>Title: Mitigating the Operational Effects Patient Isolation Requirements in Hospital Bed Assignments</br><br>Author: Ruben Proano, Assistant Professor, Rochester Institute of Technology, 81 Lomb Memorial Drive, KGCOE-1593, Rochester, NY, 14623, United States of America, rpmeie@rit.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We present an optimization model that suggests how to accommodate admitted and incoming patients in a hospital unit in order to satisfy all isolation requirements, while simultaneously ensuring the unit is used by the most critical patients, and minimizing the number of internal movements (i.e., patient shuffles). The model is then integrated into a Monte Carlo simulation experiment to determine how many single- and double-patient rooms are necessary to minimize the number of internal movements.</br>
