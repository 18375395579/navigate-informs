We discuss national healthcare measurement trends and the use and design of SPC methods for such cases. Technical considerations, recent contributions, and emerging opportunities are discussed, including risk-adjusted surveillance, weighted sequential probability ratio tests, and statistical deadband patient control schemes.</br>
