        <br>Title: Desensitization to Stimuli and Optimal Expenditures to Increase Hand-hygiene in Hospitals</br><br>Author: Reidar Hagtvedt, Assistant Professor of Management Science and Statistics, University of Alberta School of Business, 2-43 Business Building, Edmonton, AB, T6G2C7, Canada, reidar.hagtvedt@business.ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sarah Forgie</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Hand hygiene in hospitals is typically lower than recommended by the WHO. One strategy for change is to run educational campaigns, although empirical studies show health-care workers are aware of the importance of hand-hygiene. Such campaigns eventually recede into the background. We have purchased sensors for gel dispensers, in order to establish baseline usage and forgetting rates, which will then serve as input to a model to optimize resources used to increase hand-hygiene compliance.</br>
