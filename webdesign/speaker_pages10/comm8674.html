        <br>Title: Optimal Patient-centered Response to Acute Physiological Deterioration of Hospitalized Patients</br><br>Author: Muge Capan, North Carolina State University, 400 Daniels Hall College of Engineering, Raleigh, NC, United States of America, mcapan@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Julie Ivy</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Hospitalized patients are at risk of acute physiological deterioration as characterized by abnormal vital signs. Current triggers for activating medical emergency teams have many false positive results. Using patient-specific information may result in higher specificity and personalized care processes. We develop semi-Markov decision process models to capture the dynamic nature of physiologic deterioration and optimize resuscitation decisions. Optimal policies suggest a control limit structure.</br>
