        <br>Title: The Impact of Work Load on Productivity: An Econometric Analysis of Hospital Operations</br><br>Author: Diwas Kc, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States of America, diwas@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christian Terwiesch</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Prior work in the area of service operations management has assumed service rates to be exogenous to the level of system load. Using operational data from patient transport services and cardiothoracic surgery ?we show that service worker productivity is influenced by the system load and cumulative overwork: workers accelerate as load increases and cumulative overwork decreases. In the case of cardiothoracic surgery, we also provide evidence that workload can have quality implications.</br>
