        <br>Title: Simulation-Based Optimization Approach for Maximizing Liver Allocation Efficiency</br><br>Author: Nan Kong, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, kong@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Egor Dolzhenko, Patricio Rocha</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Liver allocation efficiency is greatly affected by how matched patients are ranked on the waiting list, which is determined by the allocation policy. We develop a simulation model of the waiting list with input of patient prioritization. We focus on one aspect of the prioritization: the clustering of allocation service areas. Since our ultimate goal is to find the optimal policy, we integrate simulation and optimization to ease computational burden and incorporate allocation modeling realism.</br>
