        <br>Title: How Should We Design Primary Care Physician Panels?</br><br>Author: Hari Balasubramanian, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 160 Governors Drive, Amherst, MA, United States of America, hbalasubraman@ecs.umass.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ritesh Banerjee, Brian Denton</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We present a conceptual framework to help determine the optimal size and composition of physician panels in primary care. Our objectives are two key but conflicting measures for any practice: timely access, which provides patients with appointments whenever they need care; and continuity of care, which tries to have patients see their own assigned physician and develop a long-term patient-physician relationship. We analyze results using data from the primary care practice at the Mayo Clinic.</br>
