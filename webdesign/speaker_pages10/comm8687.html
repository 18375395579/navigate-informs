        <br>Title: Optimal Colorectal Cancer Screening: Balancing Harms and Benefits</br><br>Author: Fatih Safa Erenay, Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. CPH 4323, Waterloo, ON, Canada, ferenay@uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oguzhan Alagoz, Adnan Said</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We use a POMDP model to determine the optimal colonoscopy screening policies that balance the harms (increased costs, disutility, complication risk) and benefits (increased QALYs, colorectal cancer risk) of screening using real data. We find that the optimal policies recommend more aggressive screening and some of the proposed policies outperform current guidelines in terms of QALYs and total costs. We also compare the performances of colonoscopy and other screening methods using our model.</br>
