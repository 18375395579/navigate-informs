        <br>Title: Improving Hospital Queueing with Future Information</br><br>Author: Kuang Xu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, kuangxu@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Carri Chan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: With an increase in availability of patient data, new predictive models are being developed. This begs the questions: How can forecasts and predictions of the future be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery? We examine a class of queueing models and admissions control problems in emergency departments. We show, both analytically and via simulations, that system efficiency can be substantially improved by the access to (limited) future information.</br>
