        <br>Title: Fleet Management and Equity Measures in Evacuation Transportation Planning for Multiple Hospitals</br><br>Author: Esra Agca, PhD Student, Virginia Tech, Dept. of Industrial and Systems Eng., 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, United States of America, esra.vt@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Douglas Bish, Roger Glick</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A coordinated response is required for to effectively evacuate multiple hospitals due to a regional threat (e.g., a hurricane). Organizing the evacuation response can be more complicated when it involves more than one hospital system (groups of hospitals under the same management). In this research we study optimal evacuation plans for multiple hospitals, including full centralized control, and the study of equity issues at various levels, including at the hospital system level.</br>
