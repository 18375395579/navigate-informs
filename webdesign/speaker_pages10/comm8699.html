        <br>Title: Estimates of Pre-pregnancy and Gestational Diabetes in US Women from 1980 to 2008</br><br>Author: Hector Toro-Diaz, Clemson University, 204 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, htoro@clemson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mulugeta Gebregziabher, Odette Reifsnider, Maria Mayorga, Kelly Hunt</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We estimate the prevalence of diabetes (DM) during pregnancy in non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women in the US from 1980 to 2008. Using sample data we fit a binomial regression model to estimate the risk of DM as a function of age, race/ethnicity, and BMI. This risk is applied to a simulated population to estimate maternal diabetes prevalence at the US population-level and quantify disparities.</br>
