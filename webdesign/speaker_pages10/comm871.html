        <br>Title: Optimal Inpatient Discharge Timing: A Simulation Study</br><br>Author: Nan Kong, Assistant Professor, Purdue University, 206 S. Martin Jischke Drive, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, nkong@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Pratik Parikh, Charuhas Thakar, Elizabeth Crawford</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We focus on inpatient discharge timing, an important decision in acute hospital management. Academic literature and hospital practice indicate that medically-unnecessary delays in discharging patients could lead to a reduction in effective resource capacity and ED crowding, while aggressive discharge may result in higher readmissions and increased system load. In a simulation study, we analyze discharge policies considering resource utilization and patient wait times as key performance measures.</br>
