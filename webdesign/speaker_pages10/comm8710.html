        <br>Title: Pricing Strategies for Combination Pediatric Vaccines Based on the Lowest Overall Cost Formulary</br><br>Author: Banafsheh Behzad, PhD Candidate, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 117 Transportation Building, 104 S.

Three pharmaceutical companies compete over the sale of pediatric vaccines. The main contribution of the paper is to provide the lowest overall cost formularies for a fixed cost of an injection for different prices of Pentacel. The resulting analysis shows that Pentacel could have been more competitively priced compared to the Pediarix.</br>
