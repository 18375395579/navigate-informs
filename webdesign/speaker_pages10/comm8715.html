        <br>Title: Influenza Vaccine Supply Chain with Multiple Agencies</br><br>Author: Hamed Mamani, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Bldg E40-130, Cambridge, MA, United States, hamed@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Simchi-Levi</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Billions of dollars are being allocated for influenza pandemic preparedness and vaccination is a primary weapon for fighting influenza outbreaks. We analyze a model with a single manufacturer and multiple agencies purchasing and distributing the vaccination. We show that production risks, taken by the manufacturer, lead to an insufficient supply of vaccine and design contractual agreements between the agencies and the manufacturer that can coordinate the supply chain.</br>
