        <br>Title: Optimizing Liver Allocation System Incorporating Patients?Choices and Disease Evolution</br><br>Author: Fatih Safa Erenay, Ph.D Student, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 501 N Midvale Blvd AptC, Madison, WI, 53705, United States, erenay@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mustafa Akan, Oguzhan Alagoz, Baris Ata</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We propose a more efficient liver allocation system considering patient preferences, where efficiency is measured by various performance measures such as number of wasted organs or total quality adjusted life years of patients. We capture the dynamics of disease evolution by a fluid model, whose solution leads to an intuitive dynamic index policy for assigning livers. The indices depend on acceptance probabilities, immediate rewards, and the shadow prices calculated from a dual dynamical system.</br>
