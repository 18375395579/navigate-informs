        <br>Title: Time to Abandon Nonabandonment? HIV in Resource-limited Settings</br><br>Author: Amin Khademi, Assistant Professor, Clemson University, 110 Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC, 29634, United States of America, amk130@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Roberts, Andrew Schaefer, Denis Saure</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The global fight against HIV is hindered by a lack of drugs in the developing world. When a patient in these countries is offered treatment, she typically remains on treatment until death, as policy makers and physicians follow an nonabandonment policy.  However, in many cases another patient might benefit more from the drugs, as resistance to them increases.  We quantify the cost of these nonabandonment policies. We show that this cost can be as much as 40% of the total benefit of the drugs.</br>
