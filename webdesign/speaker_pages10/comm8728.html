        <br>Title: Fully Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials: Simultaneous Learning from Multiple Patients</br><br>Author: Vishal Ahuja, University of Chicago, United States of America, vahuja@chicagobooth.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): John Birge</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Traditional clinical trials are randomized and the goal is to maximize learning. Adaptive designs, however, use information accrued during the trial. An ideal adaptive design maximizes patient health outcomes without sacrificing any potential learning. We propose such a design, one that fully exploits learning from multiple patients simultaneously. We demonstrate our design's effectiveness on a recent trial. Our design is general and applicable to any MDP setting where learning takes place.</br>
