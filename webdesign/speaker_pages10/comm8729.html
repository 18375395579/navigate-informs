        <br>Title: Asynchronous Parallelization of  Surrogate Response Surface Methods for Global Optimization</br><br>Author: Christine Shoemaker, cas12@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tipaluck Krityakierne, Taimoor Akhtar</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Response surfaces reduce effort for computationally expensive Black-Box Simulation Optimization for multimodal continuous variable problems. This effort can be further reduced through algorithm changes to facilitate asynchronous parallelism.  Methods will be discussed. The major issue is selecting the next points in decision space at which simulations will be done when multiple processors are available to accept new jobs at different times because of heterogeneity in processor speeds.</br>
