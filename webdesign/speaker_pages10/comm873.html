        <br>Title: Appointment Scheduling under Patient Preference and No-show Behavior</br><br>Author: Nan Liu, Assistant Professor, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, United States of America, nl2320@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Serhan Ziya, Jacob Feldman, Huseyin Topaloglu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a model to schedule patient appointments over time. On each day, we decide which appointment days to make available for the patients, who then choose one offered or leave without an appointment. Patients may cancel or not show up for their scheduled service. The objective is to maximize the expected daily net “profit? i.e., the revenues of serving patients less the cost of maintaining the service. We consider both the static scheduling policy and the dynamic one.</br>
