        <br>Title: Location Based Healthcare Workflows</br><br>Author: Jonathan Emanuele, Product Manager, Siemens Medical Solutions, 51 Valley Stream Pkwy, Malvern, PA, 19355, United States, jonathan.emanuele@siemens.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin O'Rourke</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Healthcare information systems today are designed to increase patient safety and operation efficiency, while at the same time decreasing costs.

A missing piece in these systems has been real time location information.  This session will look at how an integrated RFID solution can fill this gap.</br>
