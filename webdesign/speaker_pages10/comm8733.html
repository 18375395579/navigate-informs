        <br>Title: An Exact Algorithm for the Minimum Cardinality Leaf Sequence Problem in IMRT</br><br>Author: Zeki Caner Taskin, Ph.D Student, University of Florida, University of Florida, ISE Department, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6595, United States, taskin@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edwin Romeijn, James Dempsey, J. Cole Smith</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a powerful technique for radiotherapy treatment delivery. We discuss the problem of efficiently delivering a given beam intensity profile. In particular, we need to decompose the intensity profile into a set of beam shapes and associated intensities. We propose an exact algorithm to solve this problem under different efficiency criteria. Our results indicate that several clinical instances can be solved to optimality within a few minutes.</br>
