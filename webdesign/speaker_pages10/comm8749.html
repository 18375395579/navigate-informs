        <br>Title: Project Management in Clinical Trial Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Anh Ninh, Rutgers University, 640 Bartholomew Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, anhninh@rci.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yao Zhao, Adam Fleischhacker</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: One bottleneck in clinical trials is the slow patient recruitment. Companies typically address this issue by recruiting patients globally, which, however, resulted in significant overages of clinical supplies. In this study, we introduce a class of mathematical models to capture the unique attributes of clinical trial supply chains. We show how to optimally position inventory in such supply chains, and test the impact of the network structure to the problem solution.</br>
