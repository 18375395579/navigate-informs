        <br>Title: Incorporating Extrinsic Goals Into Cost-effectiveness Analyses for Technology Assessment</br><br>Author: Gordon Hazen, Professor, Northwestern University, IEMS Department, Evanston, IL, 60208, United States of America, hazen@iems.northwestern.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Min Huang</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Technology assessments that incorporate cost-effectiveness analysis typically rely on quality-adjusted life expectancy as a measure of benefit.  However, personal goal-achievement milestones extrinsic to the QALY model may be important for technologies involving interventions with immediate mortality risk.  In this case delayed intervention may have higher personal benefit.  We explore these issues and illustrate their impacts on cost-effectiveness analyses.</br>
