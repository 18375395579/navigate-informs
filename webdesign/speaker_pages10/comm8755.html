        <br>Title: Evacuation Time Estimation in an Emergency Situation for Hospitals</br><br>Author: Davood Golmohammadi, West Virginia University, WV, United States of America, dgolmoha@mix.wvu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mohsen Jafari, Haleh Valian</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, a set of functions is presented which estimates the evacuation time in an emergency situation for hospitals instead of developing a complex simulation model. These functions are not for specific layout conditions. They are flexible so that they can be used in any hospital. The functions are applied for 19 different evacuation scenarios in a hospital as part of a case study.  The results are compared to the simulation model, which has been already prepared for the hospital in the case study. The results show how these functions create valuable results without using costly simulation models.</br>
