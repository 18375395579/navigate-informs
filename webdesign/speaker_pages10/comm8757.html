        <br>Title: Adherence and Decrement Keys to Managing Chronic Disease</br><br>Author: Sean Brooks, Chair Mathematics and Computer Sc, Coppin State University, 2500 W. North Ave, Baltimore, MD, 21216, United States of America, sbrooks@coppin.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: An important first step in developing mathematical models that accurately describe the Management of Chronic Disease understands Adherence and Decrement. Here we explore the relationship between the mathematical definition of adherence and health adherence in managing chronic disease. Further, the relationship between adherence and decrement is explored mathematically. Decrement for us or departure from adherence occurs due to death during adherence and disease transition. We propose a method of capturing disease transition in the context of decrement. The utilization of high fidelity simulation can assist in exploring the relationship between adherence and disease transition Finally, we ask in what sense our analysis could produce cost effective management strategies.</br>
