        <br>Title: Modeling and Simulation of a Bariatric Surgery Program</br><br>Author: Adam Diamant, PhD Candidate, University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management, 105 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E6, Canada, Adam.Diamant09@Rotman.Utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Milner</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study the Bariatric Program at Toronto Western Hospital. The program consists of multiple visits with care providers prior to surgery. Patient wait times and abandonment have been a concern of the hospital. We apply logistic regression and survival analysis to estimate the influence of patient covariates on system time and continued participation. Transition time distribution estimates support a patient flow simulation that is used to estimate required staffing levels and throughput goals.</br>
