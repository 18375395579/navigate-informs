        <br>Title: Setting Surgical Schedules to Optimize Downstream Resource Utilization</br><br>Author: Patrick Jonathan, Professor, University of Ottawa, 55 Laurier Avenue, Ottawa, ON, K2G 3A6, Canada, patrick@telfer.uottawa.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Davood Astaraky</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Determining an appropriate surgical schedule is a tough decision process that requires the administrator to assess competing priority classes and surgical types, variable surgical times and lengths of stay post-surgery.  We seek to develop a model that optimally allocates surgeries into pre-determined surgical blocks in order to maximize utilization of operating room time and post-op beds while meeting priority specific wait time targets using an approximate dynamic programming approach.</br>
