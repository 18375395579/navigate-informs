        <br>Title: Modeling the Impact of Environmental Cleaning on the Transmission of Multidrug-resistant Organisms</br><br>Author: Sean Barnes, University of Maryland, 4352 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, sbarnes@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel Morgan, Anthony Harris, Philip Carling, Kerri Thom</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The potential acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) continues to threaten the safety of patients in many healthcare settings. Environmental contamination can play a significant role, but modeling efforts have minimized or neglected its contribution to overall transmission rates. We develop an agent-based model of the transmission of MDROs in a hospital intensive care unit to compare the impact of environmental cleaning relative to the hand washing practices of healthcare workers.</br>
