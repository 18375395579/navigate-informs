        <br>Title: Sequential Resource Allocation Decisions for Coronary Heart Disease Patients</br><br>Author: Greggory Schell, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Michigan, 1205 Beal Ave, Office 1773, ANN ARBOR, MI, 48109, United States of America, schellg@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mariel Lavieri, Wyndy Wiitala, Jeremy Sussman, Rodney Hayward</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of annually allocating limited resources to patients at risk of coronary heart disease, with the objective of minimizing the total number of coronary heart disease events over the planning horizon.  Patient-centered decisions are compared to decisions made from a panel perspective.  Our models are calibrated using clinical observations collected at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals.</br>
