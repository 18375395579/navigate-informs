        <br>Title: Ambulance Deployment for Maximum Survival</br><br>Author: Armann Ingolfsson, Associate Professor, University of Alberta School of Business, 4-30K Business Building, Edmonton, AB, T6G2R6, Canada, armann.ingolfsson@ualberta.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gunes Erdogan, Erhan Erkut</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We propose location models for emergency medical services (EMS) that incorporate survival functions into existing covering models.  Survival functions map EMS response times into probability of survival and allow the calculation of tangible outcome measures, e.g., the expected number of cardiac arrest survivors in case of cardiac arrests.  We demonstrate empirically the superiority of survival-maximizing models over covering models using data from the Edmonton EMS system.</br>
