        <br>Title: Allocation Models for Shared Ambulance Services</br><br>Author: Lavanya Marla, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 104 S. Mathews Avenue, 216E, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States of America, lavanyam@illinois.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the setting where multiple ambulance services compete to serve a population. Specifically, the instance considered is where 911-type services are currently being set up, and they compete with existing ad-hoc services. We present modeling frameworks that allow for better ambulance utilization (to decrease ambulance abandonment) and improve service levels for the population.</br>
