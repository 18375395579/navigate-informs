        <br>Title: Digitizing and Sharing Health Records</br><br>Author: Zafer Ozdemir, Assistant Professor, Miami University, 319 Upham Hall, Oxford, OH, 45056, United States of America, ozdemir@muohio.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Subhajyoti Bandyopadhyay</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) have an enormous potential to improve the safety, quality, and efficiency of health care. The availability of complete patient health information at the point of care delivery can prevent many errors and adverse events from occurring. Unfortunately, the adoption of EHR has been lagging in the U.S. In this research we investigate the economic policies that can help facilitate adoption by medical providers, as well as the welfare implications of these policies.</br>
