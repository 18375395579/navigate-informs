        <br>Title: Integrating a Patient Demand Model into Decision Making Models in Open Access Clinics</br><br>Author: Shelly Qu, Assistant Professor, North Carolina A&T State University, ISE Depart.ment, NC A&T State Univ., 1601 E. Market Street, Greensboro, NC, 27411, United States of America, xqu@ncat.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jing Shi</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Open access scheduling was introduced to improve the accessibility to outpatient clinics and reduce patient no-shows. However, the successful implementation of open access scheduling requires the match of daily healthcare provider capacity and patient demand. Since implementing new scheduling rules affects patient demands for appointments, we propose a patient demand model to capture this effect in this talk. This model can be used to determine optimal parameters in open access scheduling rules.</br>
