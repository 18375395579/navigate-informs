        <br>Title: Hedging Longevity Risk Via Issuing of Mortality Bonds</br><br>Author: Xianhua Peng, Columbia University, 313A Mudd, Department of IEOR, 500 West 120th Street, New York, NY, 10027, United States of America, xp2102@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven Kou</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The U.S. government faces substantial longevity risk, i.e. the improvement of longevity in the U.S. population leads to increase in the government's social security and medicare liability. We propose that the government may hedge longevity risk significantly by issuing mortality bonds, which are financial instruments with coupon payments depending on the mortality rates of the U.S. population. The stochastic modeling of the mortality rates and the valuation of mortality bonds are also studied.</br>
