        <br>Title: Discrete Event Simulation of a Comprehensive Care Physicians (CCP) Model</br><br>Author: David Meltzer, University of Chicago, 5841 S Maryland Avenue, MC 5000, Chicago, IL, 60637, United States of America, dmeltzer@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tom Best</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) has recently completed the first round of funding for their Innovation Challenge Awards that seek to address the triple aim of improved care, reduced costs, and improved population health.  The University of Chicago and set of Chicago-area partners received an award under this program to test a new model of care in which patients at high risk of hospitalization receive care from comprehensive care physicians (CCPs) - physicians who care for patients at high risk of hospitalization both in the inpatient and outpatient setting. The model is based on an understanding of the historical forces that led to the development of the hospitalist model in the United States and the advantages and disadvantages of that model. This analysis suggests that, while experienced hospitalists can produce some improvements in costs and outcomes, practical considerations of declining inpatient relative to outpatient patient volume were a major driver of the growth of hospitalists. Moreover, a major disadvantage of the hospitalist model, especially for frequently hospitalized patients, is the loss of the value of the doctor-patient relationship that can occur when patients are hospitalized. The CCP model addresses this concern by focusing the practices of these physician on a very small number of patients (approximately 250 per physician) at increased risk of hospitalization, so that the physician can care for these patients in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, taking primary personal responsibility for directing the care of a multidisciplinary team tailored to the needs of individual patients. To design the CCP Program , including issues such as patient selection and physician scheduling, we built a discrete event simulation model. The construction of the model provided valuable quantitative insights into the potential functioning of the CCP program, but also provided qualitative insights that were highly valuable.</br>
