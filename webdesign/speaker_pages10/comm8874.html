        <br>Title: Incentives in Healthcare: Predicting the Impact of Penalties for Hospital Re-admissions</br><br>Author: Song-Hee Kim, PhD Candidate, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America, sk3116@columbia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ann Bartel, Carri Chan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals with higher than expected 30-day readmissions for Heart Failure, Acute Myocardial Infarction, and Pneumonia will be financially penalized. Using retrospective data on patients enrolled in different Medicare programs (e.g., Fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage), we develop an understanding of the potential impact of the new legislation and how it relates to the interplay between financial and medical incentives in the provision of hospital care.</br>
