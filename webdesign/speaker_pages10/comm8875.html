        <br>Title: Getting OR Tools into the Hands of Users: Development of a Blood Donor Clinic Simulation</br><br>Author: John Blake, Associate Professor, Dalhousie University, Industrial Engineering, PO Box #1000, Halifax, NS, B3J 2X4, Canada, john.blake@dal.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sean Sangster, Candy Lipton</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Optimizing the flow of donors through blood clinics is a difficult management task because of the competing objectives of minimizing donor delay (and thus keeping donors satisfied and likely to return) while containing the cost of operations.    In this paper we present the results of a project designed to give clinic planners tools to assist them in the complex task of balancing customer service requirements with cost minimization strategies.</br>
