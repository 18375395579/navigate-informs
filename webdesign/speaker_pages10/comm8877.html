        <br>Title: Evaluation of Ambulance Transfers into UCCs to Improve Ambulance Availability & Reduce Offload Delay</br><br>Author: Ali Vahit Esensoy, ali.esensoy@utoronto.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Michael Carter</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Through the UCC initiative, selected patients with low risk of inpatient admission traveling via ambulance will be transported to a UCC instead of being sent to an ED. This study uses a probabilistic linkage between EMS and ambulatory care databases to propose changes to the patient mix, operating hours and catchment areas of these facilities given operational and medical constraints.</br>
