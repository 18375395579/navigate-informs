        <br>Title: Parents' Vaccination Decisions</br><br>Author: Julie Downs, Carnegie Mellon University, SDS PH 208, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, downs@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wändi Bruine de Bruin, Baruch Fischhoff</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Fear of side-effects and beliefs that vaccines are unnecessary may lead parents to opt out of immunization programs. We investigate thirty parents' decisions about vaccinating their children and patterns in seeking further information. The results suggest that even general acceptance of vaccination does not ensure that parents will understand the ongoing debate once they encounter it. Moreover, those who know the least about vaccination are the most vulnerable to getting misleading information.</br>
