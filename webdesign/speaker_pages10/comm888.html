        <br>Title: Using Large Scale Experiments and a CBM Simulation for Driving Effectiveness in the Supply Chain</br><br>Author: Dan Widdis, Fellow, Principal Operations Research Analyst, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 5897 Castleberry Peak Ave., Las Vegas, NV, 89131, United States of America, widdisd@ctc.com</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Component sensor data can be used both for maintenance decisions and to forecast future demand. Aggregated at the enterprise level, demand forecasts enable decision makers to prioritize orders, reposition stocks, and replenish stores in advance of anticipated future demands. Because of the large range of variables involved in these decisions and the potential interactive effects, we employ efficient experimental designs to extract the maximum information from a limited number of simulation runs.</br>
