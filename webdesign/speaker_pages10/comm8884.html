        <br>Title: Optimal Policies for Biopsy or Short Interval Imaging Follow-up Based on Patient Characteristics</br><br>Author: Jagpreet Chhatwal, Health Economist, Merck Research Laboratories, North Wales, PA, 19454, United States of America, jchhatwal@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elizabeth Burnside, Oguzhan Alagoz</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Guidelines for patient management after mammography exams do not consider individual patient characteristics. We developed a finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision process to find the optimal policies for biopsy or short-interval follow-up that maximize patient’s expected quality-adjusted life years. We estimated model’s parameters from clinical data, and performed sensitivity analyses. We provide optimal decision policies based on patient’s demographic factors and mammographic findings.</br>
