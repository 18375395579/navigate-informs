        <br>Title: Optimizing the Dose of Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccines to Reduce the Infection Attack Rate</br><br>Author: Joesph Wu, The University of Hong Kong, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong - ROC, joewu@hku.hk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: For many countries, the principal constraint for human pre-pandemic vaccine stockpiles will be the total mass of antigen maintained. We hypothesize that lower individual doses may provide extra community-level benefits because they permit wider coverage for a given size of antigen stockpile. We use a mathematical model to predict infection attack rates under different policies. We find that substantial reductions in the attack rate are likely if vaccines are given to more people at lower doses.</br>
