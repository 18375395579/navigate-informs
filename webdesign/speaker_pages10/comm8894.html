        <br>Title: Strategies for Vaccine Prioritization</br><br>Author: Eva Lee, Professor and Director, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Dr. NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fan Yuan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This work is joint with CDC. When limited vaccines are available, prioritized vaccination is considered the best strategy to contain a pandemic. In this work, we derive a mathematical decision framework to track the effectiveness of prioritized vaccination through the course of a pandemic. Our approach couples a disease propagation model with a vaccine queuing model and an optimization engine to determine the optimal prioritized coverage that results in minimum infection and mortality.</br>
