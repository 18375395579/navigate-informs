        <br>Title: Robust Dynamic Control of Living-Donor Liver Transplant Timing</br><br>Author: David Kaufman, Postdoctoral Associate, Industrial Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, United States, davidlk@engr.pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Markov decision process (MDP) models for timing of living-donor liver transplants require the estimation of underlying transition probabilities from clinical data.  Such estimation is a source of ambiguity that is inherent in many medical decision-making problems.  We incorporate this ambiguity in a “robust?MDP formulation of the living-donor problem.  We discuss choices of conditional measures based on real data for the resulting “inner problem?and implications for optimal control structures.</br>
