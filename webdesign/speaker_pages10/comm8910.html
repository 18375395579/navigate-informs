        <br>Title: A Robust Markov Decision Process for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes</br><br>Author: Yuanhui Zhang, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27606, United States of America, yzhang29@ncsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jennifer Mason, Brian Denton, Haipeng Wu, Nilay Shah, Steven Smith, James Wilson</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We present a new robust Markov decision process model to optimize treatment decisions for patients with type 2 diabetes in light of uncertainty in model parameters estimated from longitudinal data. We discuss the special structure of the model including properties that can be exploited to achieve computational advantages. Computational results based on a large clinical data set are presented to illustrate the structure and performance of the optimal policy.</br>
