        <br>Title: Home Health Nurse Routing and Scheduling</br><br>Author: Ashlea Bennett, Ph.D Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States of America, ashlea@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Erera</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the challenge of increasing resource utilization in the home care industry by improving the scheduling of home visits by nurses.  The specific resultant problems are in the class of periodic routing problems, but are complicated significantly by the dynamics of a frequently-changing patient set.  Solution approaches for dynamic periodic routing problems are presented.</br>
