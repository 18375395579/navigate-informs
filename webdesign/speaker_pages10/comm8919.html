        <br>Title: A DES-GA Method to Determine the Optimal Scheduling Templates for Open Access Clinics with Walk-ins</br><br>Author: Yidong Peng, North Dakota State University, 2940 7th st. N., Apt 4, Fargo, ND, 58102, United States of America, yidong.peng@ndsu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jing Shi, Xiuli Qu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this research, we developed a discrete event simulation and genetic algorithm (DES-GA) approach to find the optimal scheduling template under the clinic setting that admits both open access and walk-in patients by minimizing the average cost per admission of open access or walk-in patient. Our results show that the optimal scheduling templates are significantly affected by the patient attendance rate, level of demands of same-day appointment and walk-in admissions, and cost coefficients.</br>
