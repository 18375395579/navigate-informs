        <br>Title: Resource Planning for the Redesign of Pre-Op and Post-Op Care Rooms using Discrete Event Simulation</br><br>Author: Todd Huschka, Master Health Systems Analyst III, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, United States of America, huschka.todd@mayo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Roh, Thomas Rohleder, Jeanne Huddleston</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: To improve patient privacy and experience in the Mayo Clinic Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) a we examined a new design, moving from a large “open-air?PACU room to individual rooms for each patient. The rooms will also serve as the Intake area into the Operating Room changing the intake process. A discrete event simulation model was built to forecast the potential impact on capacity and length of stay, and to determine optimal nurse and transporter scheduling.</br>
