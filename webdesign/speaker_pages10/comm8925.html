        <br>Title: Design of Network Vaccine Inventory for Epidemic Disease</br><br>Author: Yifan Liu, George Mason University, SEOR, MS4A6, Fairfax, VA, 22030, yliu9@gmu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We design the necessary vaccine inventory levels nationalwide, to get prepared for a breakout of an epidemic disease. We produce the relation between the optimal inventory levels and the decisive properties of vaccine production and the infectious disease, including the usual production and shipment rate, and the population dynamics of the infectious disease in the potential regions of vaccine shortage, etc. Both analytical and simulation results are presented.</br>
