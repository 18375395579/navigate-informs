        <br>Title: Designing Liver Transplant Regions under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Mehmet C. Demirci, SmartOps Corporation, One North Shore Center, 12 Federal St Suite 400, Pittsburgh, PA, 15212, United States of America, mdemirci@smartops.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Roberts, Andrew Schaefer</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Currently in the U.S. liver allocation system, Organ Procurement Organizations are grouped into 11 regions, and a three-tier mechanism that prioritizes local and regional patients is utilized to balance organ preservation and medical urgency. We introduce stochastic programming models that capture uncertainty and maximize the expected benefit of liver transplants through region design. Our results are estimated to increase expected life-time gained per transplant operation by up to 7 per cent.</br>
