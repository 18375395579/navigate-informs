        <br>Title: Randomized Linear Programming Approach to Revenue Management</br><br>Author: Vijay Desai, Opertations Research Specialist, SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Dr, Cary, NC, 27513, United States of America, VijayV.Desai@sas.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Altan Gulcu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We provide a high-level overview of our approach to RM using RLP. Following are the key features of our methodology: a) Pricing of price-dependent products. b) Handles network-level overbooking as opposed to resource-level overbooking typically found in practice. c) Allows for imposition of service level constraints. d) Computes ancillary outputs such as occupancy forecast, revenue forecast and service levels, which are useful metrics for a revenue manager.</br>
