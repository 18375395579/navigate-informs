        <br>Title: Reserving Capacity for Urgent Patients in Primary Care</br><br>Author: Gregory Dobson, Simon School of Business, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States of America, dobson@simon.rochester.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edieal Pinker</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We examine the common practice of reserving slots for urgent patients in a primary care practice. Using a stochastic “dam?model of appointment scheduling, we optimize system performance accounting for revenue and the two service quality measures as a function of the number of reserved slots for urgent patients. Our results suggest that, performance may improve if no slots are reserved for urgent patients.</br>
