        <br>Title: Maximizing the Efficiency of the U.S. Liver Allocation System through Region Selection (Submitted to for the 2006 Pierskalla Award)</br><br>Author: Nan Kong, Assistant Professor, Industrial and Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida, ENB 118, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States, kong@eng.usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brady Hunsaker, Andrew Schaefer, Mark Roberts</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Allocating organs for transplantation has been a contentious issue in the United States for decades. One of the many remaining questions is how to cluster Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) into regions such that allocation efficiency at the regional level is maximized. We formulate the above problem as a large-scale set-partitioning problem and adapt branch and price to solve it. Computational results are presented in the talk.</br>
