        <br>Title: Trade-off Between Treatment Plan Quality and Beam-on-time in IMRT Using Direct Aperture Optimization</br><br>Author: Ehsan Salari, University of Florida, 999 SW 16th Avenue Apt 64, Gainesville, FL, 32601, United States of America, esalari@ufl.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Edwin Romeijn</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Direct aperture optimization of IMRT treatment plans allows for a much more accurate modeling of treatment delivery aspects than traditional beamlet-based treatment plan optimization. We extend a column generation approach for direct aperture optimization to include total beam-on time as one of the treatment plan evaluation criteria and use this model to determine the Pareto efficient frontier of treatment plan quality and beam-on time for clinical patient cases.</br>
