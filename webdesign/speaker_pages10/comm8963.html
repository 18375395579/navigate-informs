        <br>Title: Capacity Planning for Publicly Funded LTC in the U.S.</br><br>Author: Yan Li, West Lafayette, IN, United States of America, li528@purdue.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nan Kong, Mark Lawley, Laura Sands</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Long-term care refers to the services provided to chronically ill or disabled people, many of whom are older adults whose only funding source is public programs. It remains unclear what capacity is needed for balancing the services provided in home-based facilities and nursing home centers. In this work, we formulate a parameter optimization problem with ODE constraints. We conduct case studies on dementia patients and perform extensive sensitivity analysis to draw managerial insights.</br>
