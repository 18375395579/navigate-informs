Adjusted rates of hospital-acquired infections were compared for 400+ hospitals with a high vs. low percentage of private rooms. Hospitals with mostly private rooms had significantly lower rates of hospital-acquired infections. The business case is examined for hospital renovations that include potential savings from reducing medical errors and improving patient satisfaction.</br>
