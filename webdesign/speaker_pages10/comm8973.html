        <br>Title: Adaptive and Anticipative Decisions in Operating Room Rescheduling</br><br>Author: Sakine Batun, Assistant Professor, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, sakine@ie.metu.edu.tr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Andrew Schaefer, Brian Denton</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We consider a stochastic multi-OR scheduling problem where the initial schedule is revised at a prespecified time during the surgical day. We formulate the problem as a SMIP that minimizes the sum of the fixed cost of opening ORs and the expected overtime cost. For our numerical study, we consider a special case where rescheduling decisions are made under perfect information. We use our model to estimate the value of adaptive and anticipative decisions in OR rescheduling.</br>
