        <br>Title: A Mathematical Approach to Triage in the Context of Emergency Response Planning</br><br>Author: Evin Uzun, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Dept. of Statistics and Operations Res., Hanes Hall - CB # 3260, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-3260, United States of America, evin@unc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Serhan Ziya, Nilay Argon</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a major emergency event after which resources are overwhelmed by the number of casualties. Our objective is to identify properties of effective triage decisions that categorize patients into different priority classes based on their conditions. We use stochastic models to gain insights into this challenging problem and test the performance of several triage decisions by means of a numerical study.</br>
