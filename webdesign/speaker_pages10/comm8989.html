        <br>Title: Optimal Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Generator Replacement</br><br>Author: Anahita Khojandi, University of Pittsburgh, 1048 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, United States of America, ank83@pitt.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Oleg Prokopyev, Lisa Maillart</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: There is a trade-off between prematurely exposing ICD patients to the risk of generator replacement surgeries and allowing for the possibility that the devices are unable to deliver therapy when needed. We develop a Markov decision process model to maximize the total expected lifetime of the patient. We analytically establish that the optimal policy is of threshold-type in the ICD battery capacity. Based on clinical data and the literature, we conduct a large scale numerical experiment.</br>
