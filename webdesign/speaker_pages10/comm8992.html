        <br>Title: Operating Room Planning with Multiple Surgical Types</br><br>Author: Narges Hosseini, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, United States of America, hosseini.narges@mayo.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Rohleder, Yariv Marmor, Jeanne Huddleston</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Planning capacity for surgeries can be challenging with multiple types of surgeries using the same set of resources. Different categories of surgeries due to clinical factors, urgency, and payer type affect the operational and financial performance of a suite of operating rooms. In this study, based on the Urology Department at Mayo Clinic, we consider the allocation of OR capacity and sequencing of surgeries to maximize patient access while meeting staff satisfaction and financial constraints.</br>
