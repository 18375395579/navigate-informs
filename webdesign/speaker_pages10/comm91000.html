        <br>Title: Representing the Power and Energy Needs of Today’s Soldiers in Modeling and Simulation</br><br>Author: Dan Rice, Technology Solutions Experts, Inc., 209 West Central St, Suite 300, Natick, MA, United States of America, daniel.rice@tseboston.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Adam Peloquin, Cortney Eldridge, Steven Yuhaski</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Each piece of equipment carried increases a Soldier’s load weight, potentially impacting performance and safety. Technology Solutions Experts, Inc. (TSE) used simulation tools to study the tradeoff between Soldier encumbrance and task performance. TSE created a model and Monte Carlo simulation to study the power requirements related to a Soldier’s electronic equipment load weight to improve the ability to identify critical relationships between Soldier, equipment, and operational environment.</br>
