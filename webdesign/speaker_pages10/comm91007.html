        <br>Title: Quantifying Uncertainty Associated with Reliability Analysis in Multi-state Social Networks</br><br>Author: Kellie Schneider, Instructor of Freshman Engineering, University of Arkansas, 324 Engineering Hall, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States of America, Kellie@uark.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chase Rainwater, Ed Pohl</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We address the uncertainty associated with a reliability analysis of an influence campaign directed at a clandestine organization. We model influence as a multi-state commodity and quantify the uncertainty in both influence level probabilities and the structure of the network.  Optimization tools are proposed to identify significant players in the network and inform the allocation of influence to improve (degrade) the performance of the system.</br>
