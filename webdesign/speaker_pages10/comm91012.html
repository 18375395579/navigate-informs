        <br>Title: Pioneering Choices: The Good, the Bad, the Policy Opportunity, the Good</br><br>Author: Moren Levesque, Professor, York University, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada, MLevesque@schulich.yorku.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Arend</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We provide a mathematical model of pioneering strategic choice that differs from those in the first-mover literature in terms of the extent to which we assume pioneers can mold the ‘profit equation?involved in commercializing invention. We find an interesting pattern of outcomes arising from the strategic choices possible, including some outcome areas where expected inefficiencies can be addressed through effective policy to improve overall welfare.</br>
