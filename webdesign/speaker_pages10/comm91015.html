        <br>Title: Playing Both Sides of the Market: Success and Reciprocity on Crowdfunding Platforms</br><br>Author: Ohad Barzilay, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel, ohadbr@tau.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Zvilichovsky, Yael Inbar</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Crowdfunding platforms enable the financing of projects by soliciting small investments from a large base of potential backers over the internet. We use data collected from Kickstarter, the largest crowdfunding platform, and find that owner’s backing history has a significant impact on project financing. We find that projects created by active backers set higher goals, have higher success rates, attract more backers and collect more funds.</br>
