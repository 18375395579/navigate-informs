        <br>Title: Fit or Disrupt? A Co-Evolutionary View on Landscape Change and Innovation Strategies</br><br>Author: Fabian Sting, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands, fsting@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Murat Tarakci</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Adaptation scholars have studied firms which perform search to increase their fit with their environments; whereas other researchers have documented firms which disrupt their technology landscape. To explain why firms strive to fit or to disrupt their landscape, we move beyond the current understanding of exogenous landscape changes by incorporating co-evolutionary interactions. Using simulations, we explain the heterogeneity in organizations?innovation strategies with performance objectives.</br>
