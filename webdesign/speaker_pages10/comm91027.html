        <br>Title: Innovation Tournaments with Multiple Contributors</br><br>Author: Ersin Korpeoglu, Carnegie Mellon University Tepper School of Business, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, United States of America, ekorpeog@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Soo-Haeng Cho, Laurence Ales</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study an innovation tournament in which an organizer seeks multiple  solutions from agents. While agents exert efforts to improve solutions,  their outcomes face technical uncertainty and subjective taste of the  organizer. For a large class of distributions, we show a winner-takes-all award scheme is optimal. As participants increase, agents do not necessarily reduce their efforts, and the organizer need not always increase the award. We compare the tournament with individual contracts.</br>
