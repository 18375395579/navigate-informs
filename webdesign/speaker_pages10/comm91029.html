        <br>Title: The Internationalization of Supply Chains and the Location of Innovation Activities</br><br>Author: Francisco Veloso, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon, Engineering & Public Policy, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, fveloso@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Brian Fifarek, Cliff Davidson</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the impact of the movement of rare earth materials production from US to China on US rare earth innovation activities. We show that this movement causes some innovation activities to move away while others remain. We suggest that this relocation of innovation is conditioned by the nature of innovation processes and the role of knowledge spillovers among value chain actors. Using patents and industry observations, we employ regression and modeling techniques to test this relationship.</br>
