        <br>Title: Information Content of Investors?Demand for Volatility</br><br>Author: Scott Fung, Associate Professor, California State University - East Bay, East Bay, CA, United States of America, scottf23@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Shih-Chuan Tsai</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper examines the information content of investors?demand for volatility in an option market where investors possess heterogeneous information advantages on future volatility. Using comprehensive account-level transaction data on the Taiwan options market during financial crisis, we construct the vega-weighted net demand for volatility by heterogeneous investor types, and investigate whether a certain investor group owns an informational advantage on future market-level volatility. We find that the vega demand of better informed investors such as domestic institutional investors contains information content of future realized volatility.   Furthermore, investors?vega demand from aggressive orders reflects informed trading and predicts future realized volatility. Lastly, we investigate the lead-lag relationship among index options trading of various investor groups. We find that more informed investors such as domestic institutional investors can lead the trading activities of less informed investors such as individual investors in the options market.</br>
