        <br>Title: Understanding the Relationship among Strategy, IT,  and Performance in the Health Care Context</br><br>Author: Lorraine Lee, UNCW, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington, NC, 28403, United States of America, lorraine_lee@moore.sc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Kettinger, Rajiv Kohli</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Increasing competition is requiring hospitals to increase IT investments and offer differentiated services while also controlling costs.
