        <br>Title: Knowledge Management for Product and Process Design Teams</br><br>Author: Gulru Ozkan, Ph.D. Candidate in Operations Management, College of Management, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 W. Peachtree St., NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308-0520, United States of America, gulru.ozkan@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cheryl Gaimon, Stylianos Kavadias</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We analyze dynamic knowledge management strategies for NPD product and process design teams. Net revenue earned at the product release is a function of the knowledge embedded in the product and process during the development project. Each team's knowledge increases from learning-by-doing, knowledge transfer, and knowledge acquisition. The rates and directions for knowledge transfer, the rates of knowledge acquisition, and the product release time are optimally determined.</br>
