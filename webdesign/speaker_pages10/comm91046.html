        <br>Title: How the Inventors with Independent Inventing Experiences Influence the Other Inventors?Performance</br><br>Author: Dehong Li, Xi'an Jiaotong University, P.O.Box 2268, No.28, Xianning West Road, Xi'an, 710049, China, muzi7011@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wentian Cui, Jun Lin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Inventors with independent inventing experiences usually embrace tacit and essential knowledge of innovation. Using Chinese patent data, we show that cooperators can benefit from collaborating with the inventors with independent inventing experiences and this benefit decreases significantly as the distance between them increases. Moreover, the degree of benefit is moderated by the structural non-redundancy of the cooperator and the difference in status between them.</br>
