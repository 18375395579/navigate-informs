        <br>Title: Balancing Information Access and Risk with Capacitated IT Service</br><br>Author: Eric Johnson, Professor, Dartmouth College, Center for Digital Strategies, Tuck School of Business, Hanover, NH, 03755, United States of America, M.Eric.Johnson@tuck.dartmouth.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xia. Zhao</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Controls for information access, while needed to maintain the security, inevitably constrain the firm’s ability to respond quickly to changing needs.
