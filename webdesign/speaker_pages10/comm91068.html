        <br>Title: Predicting and Controlling Customer Churn on Multiple Time Scales</br><br>Author: Louis A (Tony) Cox, Jr., TCoxDenver@aol.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Telecommunications customer attributes change on different time scales, from not at all (sex) to relatively slowly (owner vs. renter, account age) to rapidly (number of recent calls to call center).  We show how to use information from multiple time scales to better target interventions that reduce loss of high-value customers.</br>
