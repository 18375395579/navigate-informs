        <br>Title: Explaining the Dearth of Modularly Upgradeable Products</br><br>Author: Sezer Ulku, Assistant Professor, Georgetown University MSB, su8@georgetown.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Glen Schmidt</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In markets with fast technological change, often the prescription is to use modular architectures. However, the evolution of products in the consumer electronics industry tells a different story. Handspring was initially conceived as a modular platform that allowed new applications. This feature was discarded in favor of an integral architecture that does not allow expansion. In this paper we build an analytical model to examine the demand for and supply of modularly upgradeable products.</br>
