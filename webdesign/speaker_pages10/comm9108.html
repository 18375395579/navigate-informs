        <br>Title: Utility Theory in a Networked Environment of Local Managers</br><br>Author: Steven Harper, Research Scientist, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 1205 W. Clark Street, Room 1008, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States, srharper@uiuc.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This study examined strategic investment alternatives for a networked system of managers producing a common product. Utility analysis, modeling and simulation, and game theory were applied by individual manages in there decision analysis with varied success. Results indicate that when smaller managers make changes there is little effect on the environment, whereas when larger manages make changes, the environment is changed, thus requiring updating of the managers?probability beliefs.</br>
