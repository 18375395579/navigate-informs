        <br>Title: Congruence Gaps and Their Effect on Distributed Software Development Teams</br><br>Author: Mary Helander, IBM Research, T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10603, United States of America, helandm@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kate Ehrlich, Giuseppe Valetto, Clay Williams, Stephen Davies</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Software projects are frequently distributed across multiple sites.

Modularity and even agile methods have had mixed success in addressing distributed development. We used a variation of organizational congruence that focuses on gaps in communication to examine coordination decisions in distributed development teams.</br>
