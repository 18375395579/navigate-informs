        <br>Title: Revenue Management of Network Goods under Demand Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Zizhuo Wang, University of Minnesota, 111 Church Street SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, zwang@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ming Hu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study strategic and pricing decisions for firms selling network goods under demand uncertainty. We compare the optimal committed pricing ex ante with and without social interactions, and identify two countervailing effects of allowing social interactions, a pro-interaction risk-seeking effect and an anti-interaction risk saturation effect. We obtain conditions under which curbing or cultivating social interaction is beneficial. We also show that contingent pricing is valuable in our model.</br>
