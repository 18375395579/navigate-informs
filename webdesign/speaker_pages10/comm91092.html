        <br>Title: Co-Creation of Value for IT-Enabled Services: A Case of Geocaching</br><br>Author: Tuure Tuunanen, University of Oulu, Dept. of Information Processing Science, P.O. 3000, 90014 University of Oulu, Finland, tuure@tuunanen.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Tero Vartiainen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: This study uses laddering interviews to explore how value is co-created for IT-enabled services, more precisely geocaching. The results reveal that geocaching is distinctly hedonic in nature. The results also demonstrate how the consumer information systems framework can be applied for understanding which factors influence value co-creation for IT-enabled services.</br>
