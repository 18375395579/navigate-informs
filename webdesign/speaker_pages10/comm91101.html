        <br>Title: Misconfiguration Detection and Resolution in Access Control Systems</br><br>Author: Nazia Badar, Rutgers University, 1 Washington Street, Newark, NJ, 07102, United States of America, nbadar@pegasus.rutgers.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Protecting data resources against unauthorized accesses is a prime concern for every organization. Implementation of access control system is necessary but not sufficient to ensure best protection of sensitive data. In addition to implementation, correctly configuring the deployed  access control system is also a critical factor. We examine this problem and aims to use data mining techniques for addressing this problem.</br>
