        <br>Title: An Empirical Study of Market Switching Behavior of Mobile App Developers</br><br>Author: Young Jin Lee, University of Wisconsin at Green Bay, Cofrin School of Business, Green Bay, WI, 54311, United States of America, leey@uwgb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hossein Ghasemkhani, Yong Tan</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Strategically, mobile app developers often change their free apps to be paid (or vice-versa) to increase their visibility and sales. Using Apple’s AppStore daily app rank data, we explore how an app developer determines her instantaneous app’s market, either in free app or paid app. We also examine how the duration of being either version in the AppStore is decided. Consequently, we estimate the effects of such strategic decisions on the performance of the apps in the AppStore.</br>
