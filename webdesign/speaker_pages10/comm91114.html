        <br>Title: Strategic Interaction between an Established Pioneer and a Startup Follower: Capacity and Entry Time</br><br>Author: Moren Levesque, Associate Professor, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, Canada, levesque@uwaterloo.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xuan Zhao</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper considers a situation where a market for a potential new product is emerging, but the market-ready time is unknown. An established pioneer is interested in occupying that market and a startup is also interested in growing and entering that market. We provide analytical results on the market equilibrium. The results provide insights on business strategies in emerging markets to the managers of both established and new firms.</br>
