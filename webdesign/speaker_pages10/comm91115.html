        <br>Title: External Market Data Driven Compensation Planning for Retention Management</br><br>Author: Mark Squillante, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States of America, mss@us.ibm.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Munish Goyal, Raymond Ngai, Pankaj Dayama, Raphael Ezry, Sri Harsha Wdaru</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Unpredictability in employee attrition trend across various sectors, affected by the current economic conditions, has rendered firms'   compensation plans in achieving their business goals ineffective. We marry competitive market data and strategic business goals of a firm   to evaluate goal feasibility, compute retention costs, study tradeoff analysis between attrition target level vs investment, and design surgical compensation actions that maximizes net benefit for any given feasible target.</br>
