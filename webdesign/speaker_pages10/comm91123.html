Van Wassenhove</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We examine the effect of market organization for screening for early disease detection on the quality and price of that service. Two providers offer screening and treatment services, and decide on the quality and the price of screening service. The equilibrium is characterized. A sensitivity analysis describes the effect of disease characteristics, such as prevalence, progress rate, and the service cost characteristics on the quality and price levels under competition.</br>
