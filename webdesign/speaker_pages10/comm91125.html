        <br>Title: Recommendation in Reciprocal and Bi-partite Social Networks -- A Case Study of Online Dating</br><br>Author: Xi Wang, The University of Iowa, 1000 W Benton E207, Iowa City, IA, 52242, United States of America, xi-wang-1@uiowa.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kang Zhao, Mo Yu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many real-world social networks, such as online dating and recruiting, are bipartite networks built on reciprocity. This study proposes a new collaborative filtering (CF) method for user recommendation in such social networks. It considers both the “taste?and “attractiveness?of users, so that users are interested in and attractive to recommended partners.  An empirical study of online dating shows the new method performs better than other CF methods in recommending potential dating partners.</br>
