        <br>Title: Improving Production Yield through Learning by Doing and Knowledge Sharing</br><br>Author: Hasan Arslan, Suffolk University, Boston, MA, 02108, United States of America, harslan@suffolk.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Thomas Roemer, Ali Yassine</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We address the production ramp-up for products with low initial yields. Our principal focus is on when to switch over from pilot to full production. We distinguish between process focused firms, who strive for a high degree of similarity between product lines, such as Intel's copy exactly strategy and skill focused firms, whose strength lie in their employees' skills of learning autonomously. We show that switch-over decisions must consider future margins and the focus orientation of the firm.</br>
