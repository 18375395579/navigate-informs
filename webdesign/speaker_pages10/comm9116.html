        <br>Title: Project Scheduling When Success is Uncertain</br><br>Author: Gregory Dobson, Associate Professor, University of Rochester, Simon School, Rochester, NY, United States, greg.dobson@simon.rochester.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Joseph Szmerekovsky, Vera Tilson</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine project scheduling when activity success is uncertain and can lead to project cancellation.  We look at IP formulations for a variety of special cases and develop lower bounds and heuristics.  We report on the performance of heuristics wrt lower bounds.  We investigate robustness of solutions when probabilities are difficult to estimate.</br>
