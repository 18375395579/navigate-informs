        <br>Title: Information Technology, Alliances and Firm Performance</br><br>Author: Ali Reza Tafti, Ph.D Student, University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, E0401 Elec Educ Resources Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI, 48502, United States, atafti@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sunil Mithas, M. S. Krishnan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the moderating influence of IT investment and flexible IT infrastructure in the effect of alliance activity on firm performance, distinguishing between collaborative and transactional alliances. We draw from a cross section of over 120 firms that span multiple industries, and that have collectively engaged in more than 8100 alliances over a period of 10 years. Our results indicate that IT enables firms to derive greater value from collaborative alliance activity.</br>
