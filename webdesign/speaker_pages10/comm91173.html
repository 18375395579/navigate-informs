        <br>Title: The Effect of Online Reviews on Consumer Search and Purchase Behavior</br><br>Author: Dina Mayzlin, Yale University, dina.mayzlin@yale.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wendy Moe</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: While previous literature has analyzed the impact of reviews on sales, little is known about the effect of reviews on search.  Here we analyze how an online retailer's introduction of a review tool affects the search as well as purchase behavior of its customers.  We also show that a product's reviews have positive externalities on the page views and sales of similar products.</br>
