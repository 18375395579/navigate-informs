        <br>Title: Network Formation through Developer Cross-participation in an Open Source Software Community</br><br>Author: Nilesh Saraf, Assistant Professor, Simon Fraser University, nsaraf@sfu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Deepa Chandrasekaran, Sivaramakrishna Siddarth</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Considering the open source software community as an emergent collaborative network we ask: 1)What drives a developer with prior experience on open source projects to seek out another specific project to participate in?  2) How does the network structure evolve as a result? Analyses of data from the largest open source software portal suggest that a match with past project characteristics largely drive such choices. Surprisingly, preferential attachment theory is only weakly supported.</br>
