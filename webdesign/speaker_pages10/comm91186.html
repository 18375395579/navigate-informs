        <br>Title: Disentangling the Theories of Governance Modes: Exploring the U.S. Bicycle Component Industry</br><br>Author: Jin-Kyu Park, Assitant Professor, Florida International University, Industrial & Systems Engineering, 10555 West Flagler St. / EC 3100, Miami, FL, 33174, United States of America, kyupark@fiu.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study attempts to disentangle competing theoretical explanations of firm governance mode choice between transaction cost economics, prior transaction view, and resource based view. To do so, we investigate the U.S. bicycle component industry from 1980 to 1992, using a statistical research method. This study strongly supports resource based view.</br>
