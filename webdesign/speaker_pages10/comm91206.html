        <br>Title: The Impact of Manufacturing Offshore on Technology Trajectories</br><br>Author: Erica Fuchs, Post-Doctoral Fellow, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Building E38-104, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States, erhf@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper presents a two-case study of the impact of manufacturing offshore on the technology trajectory of the firm and the industry. It looks in particular at the automotive and optoelectronics industries. In both cases, manufacturing offshore changes which design is most economic.  However, only in the optoelectronics case do the results support that manufacturing offshore is changing the path of technology development. The paper proposes a general framework to explain this difference.</br>
