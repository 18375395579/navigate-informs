        <br>Title: Effectiveness of Software Assurance Programs: Evidence from Common Criteria</br><br>Author: Rahul Telang, Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 4800 Forbes Avenue, HBH 2107D, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, rtelang@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yubao Yang</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: To overcome the information asymmetry problem, one potential reason for poor security, governments have proposed certification programs like common criteria.  Numerous countries have adopted common criteria and government agencies do not purchase a software unless it is certified.  We collected data over many different product markets on vulnerabilities in a software product to test whether the certification programs lead to fewer vulnerabilities.  Results are presented in this talk.</br>
