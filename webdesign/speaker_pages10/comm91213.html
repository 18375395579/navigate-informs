        <br>Title: Setting the Maximum Return Time for Commercial Returns in B2C Situations</br><br>Author: Simme Douwe Flapper, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, Netherlands, s.d.p.flapper@tm.tue.nl</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Commercial returns are an important selling tool in B2C situations, where the allowed return time is an important parameter to be set. In practice many different times are used.  After having given insight in a number of important issues related to a maximum return time for B2C commercial returns, a mathematical model to support the decision is given. Some results are presented and discussed. Topics for further research are indicated.</br>
