        <br>Title: Management of Innovation in the Product and Technology Markets</br><br>Author: Sinan Erzurumlu, Assistant Professor, Babson College, 231 Forest Park, Babson Park, MA, 02457, United States of America, serzurumlu@babson.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karthik Ramachandran</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Firms in many technology intensive industries increasingly license innovations to potential competitors besides using them in their own products.

In this paper, we develop a model to understand if, when and how a firm should share its innovation with a rival.</br>
