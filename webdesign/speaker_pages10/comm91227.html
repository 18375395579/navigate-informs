        <br>Title: Information Acquisition on Technology Evolution for Maintenance and Replacement Optimization</br><br>Author: Thomas Yeung, Associate Professor, Ecole des Mines de Nantes, 4 rue Alfred Kastler, BP 20722, Nantes, 44307, France, thomas.yeung@mines-nantes.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Khanh Nguyen, Bruno Castanier</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Uncertain technology evolution strongly impacts asset replacement decisions as there is risk in replacing too early or too late. Further, maintenance allows more time to wait for future technology and risk can be mitigated by obtaining information on future technology. We incorporate information acquisition decisions into a non-stationary Markov decision process for maintenance optimization. We provide analytical properties on the optimal policy and illustrate them through numerical examples.</br>
