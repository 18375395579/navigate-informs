        <br>Title: Using Value-focused Thinking in the JCIDS Process</br><br>Author: Matt Aylward, USMC, 3300 Russell Road, Quantico, VA, United States of America, matthew.aylward@usmc.mil</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We built an Excel tool for Borda voting as part of a Capabilities-Based Assessment effort, simplifying the task of determining the group’s judgment on the correct rank-order while preserving preferences of team members.  With four rounds of voting, analysts were able to display the Tasks, Conditions and Standards in rank order, a fully-populated Swing Weight Matrix, the global and local weights ?in short, a completely specified quantitative value model.  Necessary prep work is also covered.</br>
