        <br>Title: Personality, Communication and Team Performance</br><br>Author: Gretchen Macht, Ph.D. Candidate, Pennsylvania State University, 310 Leonhard Bldg., University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, gretchen.macht@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We consider the degree to which the Five Factor Model characteristic of individual extraversion is predictive of the overall performance of dyadic teams. Structural equation models are considered to examine the direct and indirect effects of individual extraversion on team performance. Notably, the degree of extraversion did not directly affect team performance. However, there are several models that indicate significant relationships between extraversion and team performance with communications as mediators. The current results contribute to the literature by adding further understanding of the mediating variables that exist within the personality-performance team dynamic.</br>
