        <br>Title: Market Payoff Estimation for Innovative Projects under Intense Competition</br><br>Author: Leonardo P. Santiago, Assistant Professor, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Escola de Engenharia, Av. Antonio Carlos, 6627 - Pampulha, Belo Horizonte, MG, 31270-901, Brazil, lsantiago@ufmg.br</br><br>Coauthor(s): Daniel T. Elói-Santos</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider the problem of marketing payoff estimation for innovative projects, taking into account the high competition throughout the innovation life cycle. Motivated by the practical relevance and the gap in the current literature, we developed a game theoretical model for predicting an innovation's potential reward in oligopolistic markets. We analyze the impact of input parameters on the innovation value and discuss the model’s practical implementation.</br>
