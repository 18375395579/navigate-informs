        <br>Title: Cross-Functional Coordination in Supply Chain (SC) Forecasting and Planning</br><br>Author: Noel Watson, Assistant Professor, Harvard Business School, Soldiers Field Road, Medford, MA, 02155, United States, nwatson@hbs.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Quant. models of cross-functional coordination primarily exploit incentives which require complete system-wide knowledge by a planner. In practice, some efforts have instead focused on specific process mechanisms such as improving directly the collective information processing abilities of participating functions. We re-examine then coordination to see what is achievable without primarily changing incentives. Behavioral dynamic constructs such as perceptions are valuable in our models.</br>
