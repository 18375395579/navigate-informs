        <br>Title: Quantitative Intelligence Analysis</br><br>Author: Christopher Smith, PhD Student, U.S. Army/ University of Virginia, 1044 Autumn Hill Ct, Crozet, VA, 22932, United States of America, christopher.m.smith@us.army.mil</br><br>Coauthor(s): William Scherer, Stephen Carr</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: A methodology is proposed to supplement the subjective “value?of intelligence with an objective metric of “impact?of intelligence on network models.  This metric would measure the impact of a piece of intelligence on a network’s metric, being used to answer analyst intelligence questions or gain insight on a network.  Our methodology suggests that on an intelligence driven network, each document can bring information in the form of unique links and nodes which can be measured quantitatively.</br>
