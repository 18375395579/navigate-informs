        <br>Title: Learning and Forgetting:  Vendor Quality Improvement</br><br>Author: Anupam Agrawal, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 363 Wohlers Hall, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, anupam@illinois.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Suresh Muthulingam</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We assess the relative benefits of quality improvement initiatives (process improvement, quality assurance, and design improvements) and compare the learning and forgetting from these initiatives to those in autonomous learning. Our analysis of 4,700 initiatives indicates that (i)Induced learning decays at a slower rate than autonomous learning (ii)Quality Assurance initiatives provide more stable quality improvement results: the benefits persist over time.</br>
