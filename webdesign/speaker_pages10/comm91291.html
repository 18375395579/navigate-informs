        <br>Title: An Application of Risk Analysis of an R&D Pharmaceutical Portfolio</br><br>Author: Jack Kloeber, Partner, Kromite, LLC, 82 Nelson Drive, Churchville, 18966, United States of America, jkloeber@kromite.com</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The risk of an R&D Portfolio in the Pharmaceuticals Industry is most often tied to the technical risk of launching a new drug.  The uncertainty of the marketplace, once a drug is approved, provides another source of risk.  A risk analysis of a large portfolio (>50 drugs),should also include scientific, medical, manufacturing, regulatory, and marketplace dependencies.  I will briefly discuss an effort in which we attempted such an analysis, and the challenges and opportunities for future efforts.</br>
