        <br>Title: Implementing Innovation Strategy: The Effects of Organizational Structure and Project Scope</br><br>Author: Jeremy Kovach, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree Street NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, jeremy.kovach@scheller.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stylianos Kavadias</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: During the project definition (scoping) phase of a project, strategic initiatives are translated into executable objectives.  We investigate how the organizational structure, project scope, and performance metrics influence the implementation of innovation strategy.  We recognize the dual role of performance metrics: they communicate the project scope (what types of project outcomes are sought), and determine the organizational impetus (effort commitment) from the functional stakeholders.</br>
