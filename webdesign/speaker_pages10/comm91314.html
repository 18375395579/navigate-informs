        <br>Title: Promoters versus Preventers: Near-miss Events and Subsequent Risk Perception</br><br>Author: Florian Federspiel, PhD Candidate, IE Business School, Calle Maria de Molina 12, bajo, Madrid, 28006, Spain, ffederspiel.phd2014@student.ie.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jill Waymire Paine, Matthias Seifert</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Our experimental study focuses on changes in perceived risk after having experienced a near-miss event. We distinguish between different kinds of near-misses (salient versus non-salient; small loss versus no loss) and we measure perceived risk using different measures (a direct one and two kinds of utility assessments). We further focus on interaction effects between displaying a promotion versus prevention focus and the risk perception after experiencing the different kinds of near-miss events.</br>
