        <br>Title: The Impact of Web-based Risk Calculators on Health Risk Perceptions and Information Processing</br><br>Author: Christopher Harle, Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz School, HBH 242, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, charle@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rema Padman, Julie Downs</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Through statistical models embedded in health risk calculators Internet users can obtain personalized disease risk assessments. The perceptual and behavioral responses to these websites are unclear. We experimentally measured the impact of a personalized diabetes risk calculator on user information processing and subjective risk perceptions. Results suggest personalized risk estimates may actually reduce information usage and motivate modest changes in subjective risk beliefs.</br>
