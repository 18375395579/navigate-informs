        <br>Title: Revisit to Architectural Innovation</br><br>Author: Jin-Kyu Park, Assitant Professor, Florida International University, Industrial & Systems Engineering, 10555 West Flagler St. / EC 3100, Miami, FL, 33174, United States of America, kyupark@fiu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chanchai Tangpong, Young K. Ro</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: The widely accepted notion that incumbent firms falter in the market when dealing with architectural innovation begs the question of whether they can successfully introduce architectural innovations in a mature industry.  We investigate the U.S bicycle drive train component industries via in-depth case analyses.  This study highlights the importance of an incumbent’s prior innovation experience, new product architecture knowledge, and hierarchy mode for successful architectural innovation.</br>
