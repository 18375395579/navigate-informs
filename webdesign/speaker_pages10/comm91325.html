        <br>Title: On Two Dimensional Product Differentiation and Use of Personalization Technology</br><br>Author: Sunil Wattal, Doctoral Candidate, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, swattal@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Rahul Telang, Tridas Mukhopadhyay</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this research, we examine the economics of personalization in the case of information goods. We consider a more general 2 dimensional model of product differentiation where consumers attach different  importance to various product attributes. We also examine different market structures based on the locational differentiation. We report the equilibrium in terms of the ‘Quality-Fit?Ratio, which measures the relative strength of consumer preferences on each dimension of product differentiation.</br>
