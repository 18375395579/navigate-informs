        <br>Title: Coherent Approaches to Risk in Optimization Under Uncertainty</br><br>Author: R. Tyrrell Rockafellar, Professor Emeritus, University of Washington, Department of Mathematics, Box 354350, Seattle, WA, 98195-4350, United States, rtr@math.washington.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Decisions often need to be made before all the facts are in.  Essentially then, the outcomes are random variables which have to be quantified with respect to their inherent risk.  Constraints may need to be viewed in a probabilistic manner, perhaps with the introduction of safety margins.  This tutorial concerns the methodology for dealing with such issues.  Questions of whether a particular approach is coherent or not are addressed, in particular.</br>
