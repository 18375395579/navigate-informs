        <br>Title: Reliability Performance of Repairable Systems</br><br>Author: Wendai Wang, Senior Reliability Methods Manager, Applied Materials, 3320 Scott Blvd., M/S 1117, Santa Clara, CA, 95052, United States, wendai_wang@amat.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Many systems are indeed repairable in service. Reliability methodologies for repairables are so incomplete. Most engineering practices were adopted from non-repairable systems. Many assumptions are used consciously or unconsciously. This talk will review the existing methodologies for repairable systems, present studies on the TBF/TTR of the repairable systems, and provide some conclusions. The presentation is also intended to prompt more researches on reliability of repairable systems.</br>
