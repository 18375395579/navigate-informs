        <br>Title: Repeat Adopters and Adoption Patterns for Second Generation Automobiles</br><br>Author: Kwong Chan, Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 121 Presidents Drive, Amherst, MA, 01002, United States of America, kwongchan@mktg.umass.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A second product generation is offered to two adopter populations: repeat adopters, who consist of innovative adopters that purchased the first generation product, and a larger market of imitative new-adopters that did not. This study models social connections between adopters of second generation automobiles to test for cross-adopter influence. The findings indicate purchase by new adopters of a second generation automobile is accelerated by repeat adopters and to a lesser extent, new adopters.</br>
