        <br>Title: Imitative Competition: Implications for Strategic Sourcing and Technology Transfer</br><br>Author: Jiong Sun, Doctoral Student, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States, jiong@cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Laurens Debo, Sunder Kekre, Jinhong Xie</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Technology transfer offers global firms an opportunity to penetrate into emerging markets as well as source for their home markets. However, it also poses risks of potential technology imitation by local firms who may enter the emerging market and invade subsequently the global firms' home markets as well. We study how the competition affects a global firm's technology transfer and sourcing decisions, and a local competitor's imitation and exporting choices.</br>
