        <br>Title: Grease or Gamble? Corruption and Cross-country Productivity Differences</br><br>Author: Antti Saastamoinen, Aalto University School of Economics, PL 21220, Helsinki, Finland, antti.saastamoinen@aalto.fi</br><br>Coauthor(s): Timo Kuosmanen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The effects of corruption on macroeconomic aggregates are vastly researched area. However, the applications of frontier methods, such as DEA or SFA, to the study of the effects on aggregate productivity are few. We employ a new semi-nonparametric frontier method to study the issue. Our results indicate that in addition to lowering the productivity level, corruption also contributes significantly in making the production environment more volatile, a result not identified by earlier research.</br>
