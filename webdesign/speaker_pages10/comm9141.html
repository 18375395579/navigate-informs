        <br>Title: How to Sell Multiple Units? Competition and Social Preferences</br><br>Author: Elena Katok, Associate Professor, Penn State University, 465 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States of America, ekatok@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Richard Engelbrecht-Wiggans, Axel Ockenfels</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We consider a setting in which one supplier is selling multiple units to multiple buyers.  Our simplified setting can be thought of as the Ultimatum game with one proposer and multiple responder.  We extend a model of social preference to multiple responders and find that it implies that rejection rates should go down.  We test this prediction in the laboratory and find that our data confirms the theory.</br>
