        <br>Title: Modeling Secrecy and Deception in Homeland Security Resource Allocation</br><br>Author: Jun Zhuang, Ph.D. Candidate & Research Assistant, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 3237 Mechanical Engineering Building, 1513 University Ave, Madison, WI, 53706, United States, jzhuang@wisc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Vicki Bier</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: In this work, we develop a game-theoretical model for whether and how a defender should disclose her resource allocation in the homeland-security context. Our model allows us to explore whether the defender should disclose correct information about her defensive resource allocation, incorrect information, or no information. Although we study secrecy and deception specifically in the homeland-security context, our work could provide insights in other contexts, such as business competition.</br>
