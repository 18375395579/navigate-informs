        <br>Title: Mass Customization: An Enterprise-wide Business Strategy</br><br>Author: David J. Gardner, Management Consultant, Mass Customization Expert, 18603 Wedge Parkway #L170, Reno, NV, 89511, United States, djg@mass-customization-expert.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Mass Customization (also known as build-to-order, assemble-to-order and engineer-to-order) is a different business paradigm from Mass Production.   This presentation addresses why mass customization for manufactured products must be viewed holistically across the enterprise to ensure operational success.  It also discusses the notion of the extended enterprise where dealers and/or customers play a key role in configuring order configurations and how they must be connected to the enterprise.</br>
