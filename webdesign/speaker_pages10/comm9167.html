We introduce a holistic treatment of how workforce knowledge changes over time including phenomena such as knowledge depreciation, forgetting and obsolescence. The manager invests in learning-before-doing to reduce the extent of workforce knowledge obsolescence that occurs at a technology upgrade.</br>
