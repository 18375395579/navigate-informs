        <br>Title: Technological Development at the Boundaries of the Firm</br><br>Author: Jeffrey Macher, Assistant Professor, Georgetown University, G-04 Old North, Washington, DC, 20057, United States, jtm4@georgetown.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper examines how the knowledge-based view can be applied to firm boundary decisions and the performance implications of those decisions. A theoretical and empirical examination of how firms efficiently organize for technological development is conducted. Particular organization approaches are superior, depending on the structure of problems and the depth of technological area experience. Semiconductor manufacturing and pharmaceutical drug development serve as the empirical settings.</br>
