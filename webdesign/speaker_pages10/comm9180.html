        <br>Title: Hierarchies and Problem Solving Oscillations</br><br>Author: Juergen Mihm, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, jurgen.mihm@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bernardo Huberman, Christoph Loch</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The vertical hierarchy is the most common way of coordinating specialized groups and their separate decisions in organizations. The distributed nature of problem solving in NPD leads to oscillations and even instability (failure of design teams to converge to a solution). This talk shows, that such problems solving oscillations arise in large organizations under very general circumstances and that coordination through hierarchies can help to dampen such oscillations and create stability.</br>
