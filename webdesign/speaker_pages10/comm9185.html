        <br>Title: Dynamic Capability as a Creation of Novelty: Path-creation in the Context of Nanotechnology</br><br>Author: Krsto Pandza, Marie Curie Intra-European Fellow, The University of Leeds, Maurice Keyworth Building, Leeds, LS2 9JT, United Kingdom, kp@lubs.leeds.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This research investigates the path-creation processes in the context of emergent technology and the role of managerial agency in shaping the creation of novel capabilities. It analyses situations in which (1) firms intentionally develop new capabilities for exploring uncertainty in order to continuously create novel knowledge and (2) firms that base their identity on an emergent technology strive to transform their expertise in different domains of application.</br>
