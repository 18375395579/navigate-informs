        <br>Title: Relicensing Fees as a Secondary Market Strategy</br><br>Author: Nektarios Oraiopoulos, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree Street NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, nektarios@gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Ferguson, Beril Toktay</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Recent articles have criticized some OEMs who are perceived to be trying to eliminate the secondary market for their products. The tradeoff that needs to be examined is whether the benefit from maintaining a secondary market can outweigh the effect of cannibalization. We develop a model where the OEM can affect the resale value through a relicensing fee charged to the buyer of the used equipment. We derive the conditions that favor stimulating or deterring the secondary market.</br>
