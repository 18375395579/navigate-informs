        <br>Title: When Should the Majority of Remaining US Combat Troops Withdraw from Iraq?</br><br>Author: Tori Hinde, KGSB/University of Pittsburgh, Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, tjhinde@katz.pitt.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The goal of this project was to determine the optimal US troop withdrawal strategy. The synthesized results of the entire ANP model which took into account the weighting factors of the strategic rating model indicate that the highest rated alternative for the short run is to withdraw major US combat troops in 2-5 years. The long run results, and those that should be used, indicate that the alternative with the best results for all participants is to redeploy the US troops within the region.</br>
