        <br>Title: The Adoption of Multiple Dependent Technologies</br><br>Author: Soo-Haeng Cho, Assistant Professor, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, soohaeng@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kevin McCardle</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A firm often makes an adoption decision regarding an improvement of one technology depending on changes in other technologies. While the literature has attributed the slow adoption of an innovation mainly to uncertainties outside the firm, this paper shows that the economic dependence among multiple types of technologies that inherently defines cost relationships inside the firm can significantly influence the timing of adoption. We support results with evidence from the semiconductor industry.</br>
