        <br>Title: The Role of Absorptive Capacity and Industry Context in the Search for New Competencies</br><br>Author: Arvin Sahaym, University of Washington, arvin@u.washington.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeff Barden, Kevin Steensma</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Research and development (R&D) and corporate venture capital (CVC) are two fundamental modes by which capabilities are developed within industries.  However, there is some debate regarding how resources are allocated between these two modes of capability development, and the conditions under which internal R&D influences CVC. On the one hand, these modes of investment may be substitutes for each other.  The choice between developing capabilities in house and accessing them in the venture capital marketplace represents a classic “make or buy?decision.  On the other hand, these modes of investments may be complementary. Internally-developed knowledge can increase the ability to recognize and assimilate valuable technologies in potential venture targets. In this study, we examine the relationship between R&D investments and industry CVC deals. We find that R&D investments increase the number of CVC deals in an industry.  Moreover, we find that industry growth combined with rapid technological change enhances the complementary relationship between R&D and CVC.</br>
