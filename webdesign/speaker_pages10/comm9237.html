        <br>Title: Does Offshoring Impact Customer Satisfaction?</br><br>Author: Jonathan Whitaker, Doctoral Candidate, University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, jwwhitak@umich.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): M.S. Krishnan, Claes Fornell</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: While researchers have noted an increase in offshoring, there is limited work on the implications for firms and consumers.  This research begins to address these implications by studying the relationship between firms?offshoring activities and their American Customer Satisfaction Index?scores.  We analyze panel data of 68 firms from 1997-2004, and find that offshoring is associated with an increase in perceived value and perceived quality, the two key components of customer satisfaction.</br>
