        <br>Title: The Geography of Retail Inventory</br><br>Author: Richard Lai, Harvard Business School, Gallatin Hall, Boston, MA, 02163, United States, rlai@hbs.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: How different are retailers?inventory levels around the world?  I test various forms of global determinism: are levels constant across countries, converging, or at least co-integrating?  The tests use a novel dataset covering 4,100 retailers in 23 countries.  I find evidence to reject all the three forms of global determinism.  Instead, I report evidence consistent with an alternative hypothesis ?“local contingency??in which country effects are significant.</br>
