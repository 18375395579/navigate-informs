        <br>Title: Evidence of Heterogeneity in Technological Learning in the U.S. Electricity Industry</br><br>Author: Ekundayo Shittu, Assistant Professor, Tulane University, 7 McAlister Dr., New Orleans, LA, 70118, United States of America, eshittu@tulane.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Carmen Weigelt</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We investigate how technological heterogeneity affects knowledge acquisition and diffusion across evolving intra-firm and competitive inter-firm ecosystems. We use spatial and intertemporal panel data from U.S. electricity firms from 1999 to 2010 to investigate the measured approach to the adoption of renewable electricity. We find that technological heterogeneity introduces asymmetries in knowledge gain.</br>
