        <br>Title: Combating Child Labor: Incentives and Information Transparency in Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Ying Xu, PhD Student, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, yingx1@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sridhar Tayur, Soo-Haeng Cho</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: An estimated 158 million children aged 5-14 are engaged in child labor. Besides poverty in underdeveloped countries, extensive outsourcing has slowed child labor reform by encouraging firms to seek low labor costs. This paper examines the incentive of a multinational firm to induce or combat child labor via its supply contract and internal monitoring. We then investigate the potential effects of the new legislation in the U.S. that requires disclosures on corporate efforts to combat child labor.</br>
