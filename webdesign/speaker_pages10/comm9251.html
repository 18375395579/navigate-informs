        <br>Title: Testing a Theory of Network-Based Knowledge Spillovers in the Agglomeration of Technology Industries</br><br>Author: Ajay Kumar, Doctoral Student, The University of Minnesota, Carlson School of Management, Minneapolis, 55455, United States, akumar2@csom.umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert Kauffman</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We analyze the impacts of IT on the agglomeration of technology industries based on the multiple theoretical perspectives. We show that increasing use of IT diminishes the impetus of both market size linkages and congestion. It also leads to new IT industry agglomerations around thick labor markets. Agglomerated industries benefit from localized and network-based knowledge spillovers. The net impact of these effects leads to greater IT industry agglomeration.</br>
