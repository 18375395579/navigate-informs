        <br>Title: Aggregating and Distilling the Wisdom of Competitive Crowds</br><br>Author: Asa Palley, Duke University, The Fuqua School of Business, 100 Fuqua Drive, Box 90120, Durham, NC, 27708, United States of America, abp12@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jack Soll, Yael Grushka-Cockayne, Casey Lichtendahl</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Forecasting competitions offer a simple and widely-used mechanism for eliciting judgments from many experts. However, when information is both publicly and privately available, individual forecasters have an incentive to distort their responses, and the competitive crowd's aggregated judgment overweights public information. We test these results experimentally and examine procedures that can be used in forecasting competitions to recover private signals and better aggregate crowd information.</br>
