        <br>Title: Information Acquisition in Competitive R&D Markets: Market Research Vs. Competitive Intelligence</br><br>Author: He Chen, PhD Candidate, University of Maryland College Park, 3330C Van Munching Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, United States of America, hechen@rhsmith.umd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yi Xu, Manu Goyal</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Before key R&D decisions, firms often acquire information about important market characteristics.

We prove that competitive intelligence emerges endogenously, even when information through market research is free and generates higher value.</br>
