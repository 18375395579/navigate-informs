        <br>Title: A Unified Framework for Active Classifier Learning</br><br>Author: Maytal Saar-Tsechansky, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Maytal.Saar-Tsechansky@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Empirical active learning approaches for classification often offer intuition to explain how the policies identify informative examples for learning. However, the intuitions are sometimes inconsistent and do not help explain some empirical results. I will present a unified theoretical framework that can be used to explain the benefits of popular active learning policies. The framework also lays foundations for the development of new active learning policies.</br>
