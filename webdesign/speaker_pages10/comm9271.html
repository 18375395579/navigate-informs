        <br>Title: Social Network Modeling for Understanding Food Culture</br><br>Author: Ozgur Araz, Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, 68198-4365, United States of America, ozgur.araz@unmc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Terry Huang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Existing body of literature for understanding the influence of social networks on food consumption behaviors is limited in terms of taking the cultural influences and values into consideration. We built an agent based model to explore two different types of social networks for analyzing the impact of individuals?social relations on food values and culture. These weighing of different ties in individuals?network allow our research to explore social network characteristics more adequately.</br>
