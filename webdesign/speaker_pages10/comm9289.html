        <br>Title: IT Adoption, Business Process Isomorphism and the Development of IT Capabilities</br><br>Author: Andrea Masini, Assistant Professor, London Business School, Sussex Place, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, amasini@london.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper suggests that the generation of IT capabilities produces short-term performance advantages. Yet, in the long run the widespread diffusion of IT-based process templates may reduce performance differences among firms, thereby challenging the value of IT as a source of long-term competitive advantage. The role of environmental moderators in this process is also discussed.</br>
