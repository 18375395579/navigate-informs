        <br>Title: New Product Development: The Impact of Competition</br><br>Author: Janne Kettunen, Researcher, Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory, P.O. Box 1100, Espoo, 02150, Finland, jkettunen@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ahti Salo, Bert De Reyck, Zeger Degraeve, Yael Grushka-Cockayne</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We examine how the intensity and the type of competition affect the value of managerial flexibility in new product development projects and the value of obtaining information as to the market requirements. Uncertainties in our model are product performance, which is influenced by the company’s technological capabilities, and market requirements, which is driven by the competition. We draw managerial insights regarding the decisions to enhance development, abandon production, and launch product.</br>
