        <br>Title: Stakeholder Commitment: Product Development With Uncertainty</br><br>Author: Jeremy Kovach, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree St. NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, Jeremy.Kovach@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stylianos Kavadias</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We explore incentive structures used by firms to motivate functional stakeholders?resource commitment decisions during NPD projects.  We consider projects where as the project progresses, the locus of responsibility shifts from one functional stakeholder to another.   We design optimal contracts for the functional stakeholders, factoring in the stakeholder’s preference to resource commitment, in order to maximize project value based on the project uncertainty and project monitoring costs.</br>
