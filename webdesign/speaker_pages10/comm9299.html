        <br>Title: An Ecology of Innovation</br><br>Author: James Utterback, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States of America, jmu@mit.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Amid an increasingly diverse and chaotic scene of changing markets and widening competition, I will argue for thinking of innovation and firm formation as a process of experimentation in the market.
