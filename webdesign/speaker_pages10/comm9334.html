        <br>Title: Collaborating Effectively on Globally Sourced IT Projects</br><br>Author: Natalia Levina, Assistant Professor, New York University, Stern School of Business, New York, NY, 10012, United States, nlevina@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: It has been argued that offshoring complex and poorly defined IT projects is best accomplished through captive centers. I will discuss the case of a large global bank which used both captive centers and 3rd party vendors. Surprisingly, the data indicated that project effectiveness did not depend on whether the project was kept within firm boundaries. Instead, it depended on an effective engagement of mid-level managers in specific boundary-spanning practices.</br>
