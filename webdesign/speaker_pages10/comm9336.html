        <br>Title: Ambiguous Problem Complexity, Group Synergy and Performance: An Experiment</br><br>Author: Elliot Bendoly, Associate Professor, Emory University, 1300 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, United States of America, elliot_bendoly@bus.emory.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Stylianos Kavadias, Svenja Sommer</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Kavadias and Sommer (2009) describe a normative model predicting strong collaborative group problem solving in relatively simple settings, but weakness in increasingly complex ones. We revisit the issue through a computer-based experiment. The value of the normative model is strengthened through the consideration of member diversity, focus, control and accountability.</br>
