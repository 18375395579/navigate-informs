        <br>Title: Optimization Models for Policy Evaluation of Sex Offender Laws</br><br>Author: Tony Grubesic, Assistant Professor, Indiana University, Department of Geography, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN, 47405, United States of America, tgrubesi@indiana.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Alan Murray</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Effective management of convicted sex offenders is a challenging problem. Recent legislation uses geographic constraints to limit the residential options of convicted sex offenders.  Critics suggest that communities with less rigorous ordinances absorb a disproportionately high number of offenders, putting sensitive populations at risk.  This paper uses spatial optimization to evaluate spatial risk and the geographic distribution of sex offenders within a community in relation to public policy.</br>
