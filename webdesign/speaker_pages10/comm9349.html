        <br>Title: Appropriateness of Sequential and Simultaneous Innovation</br><br>Author: Karthik Ramachandran, The University of Texas at Austin, 4580 Huggins Street, San Diego, CA, United States, karthikr@Mail.utexas.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: While simultaneous creation of multiple variants allows leveraging complementarities in the product platform, sequential pursuit of improving variants enables focused execution of product development projects. We study the sequential vs simultaneous innovation problem faced by firms in developing products for multiple market segments. We show that the optimal simultaneity in development depends on resources available, technological characteristics, and most importantly, the maturity of the firm.</br>
