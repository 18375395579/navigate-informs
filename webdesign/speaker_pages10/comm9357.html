        <br>Title: Fire in the Belly? Employee Motives and Innovative Performance in Startups versus Established Firms</br><br>Author: Henry Sauermann, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 W. Peachtree St., Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, Henry.Sauermann@scheller.gatech.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We compare startup employees?pecuniary and non-pecuniary motives with those of employees working in small and large established firms, and examine the extent to which existing differences in motives distinguish employees?innovative performance. Using data on over 10,000 U.S. R&D employees, we find significant differences in motives and innovative performance across firm types and the former partly explain the latter.</br>
