        <br>Title: Supply Chain Disruption and Swift Knowledge Transfer</br><br>Author: Rebecca Clemons, Doctoral Student, Cleveland State University, 521 West Lakeshore Drive, Port Clinton, OH, 43452, United States of America, clemonsbec@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Raymond Henry</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Many manufacturers experience situations where disruptions in supply require a new supplier to be brought into production quickly.

The objective is to examine the critical factors that impact the swift transfer of knowledge within a supply chain.</br>
