        <br>Title: Making the Market Material: Managing Price Exceptions in B2B Markets</br><br>Author: Mark Bergen, Professor, James D. Watkins Chair in Marketing, Associate Dean of Carlson Executive Education Programs, University of Minnesota, Carlson School of Managment, 321 19th Avenue South, minneapolis, 55455, United States of America, mbergen@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mark Zbaracki</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We focus on three successive pricing directors and their battles over exceptions to their list prices at a large, Midwestern manufacturing firm. We find that each manager created a set of artifacts to improve pricing that were material steps in the directions they were hoping to accomplish, and that subsequent managers used parts of these artifacts in combination with new artifacts to implement their vision of pricing.</br>
