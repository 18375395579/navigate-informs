        <br>Title: Information Acquisition for Optimizing New Technology Adoption in Equipment Replacement</br><br>Author: Thomas Yeung, Associate Professor, Ecole des Mines de Nantes, 4 rue Alfred Kastler, BP 20722, Nantes, 44307, France, thomas.yeung@mines-nantes.fr</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bruno Castanier, Khanh Nguyen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Uncertain technology evolution strongly impacts asset replacement decisions as there is risk in replacing too early or too late. We investigate the optimal timing of information acquisition on new technology and how it affects equipment operation and replacement decisions. We develop a non-stationary Markov decision process model and provide analytical properties and sensitivity analysis on the optimal policy for information acquisition and illustrate them through numerical examples.</br>
