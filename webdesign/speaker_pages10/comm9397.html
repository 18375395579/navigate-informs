        <br>Title: An Analysis of Inflationary and Competitive Click Fraud</br><br>Author: Kenneth Wilbur, Assistant Professor of Marketing, University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business, 3660 Trousdale Parkway, ACC 306E, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, United States, kwilbur@marshall.usc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Simon Anderson, Yi Zhu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We use an analytical model to investigate the effects of click fraud. We find three main results. First, when inflationary click fraud is deterministic and known to both firms, it does not alter the auction outcome, firms' advertising costs, or gatekeeper revenues. Second, when inflationary click fraud is stochastic, the high bidder may reduce its budget to hedge against high levels of invalid clicks. Third, we show that competitive click fraud may increase or decrease gatekeeper revenues.</br>
