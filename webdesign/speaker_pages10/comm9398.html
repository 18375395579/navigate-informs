        <br>Title: The Geography of Trade on eBay and MercadoLibre.com</br><br>Author: Asis Martinez-Jerez, Assistant Professor, Morgan Hall 397, Harvard Business School, Soldiers Field Road, Boston, MA, 02163, United States, amartinezjerez@hbs.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ali Hortacsu, Jason Douglas</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the geographic patterns of trade in two large online auction sites, eBay and MercadoLibre. The online auction environment can be considered frictionless in certain important dimensions, so trade should not be distance-dependent.  However, we find that distance has a very negative and non-linear effect on trade as commerce is abnormally high within the city limits and abnormally low across borders.</br>
