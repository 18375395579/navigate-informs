        <br>Title: Designing Government Feed-In-Tariff Policies to Promote Green Technologies</br><br>Author: Saed Alizamir, PhD Student, Duke University, 100 Fuqua Drive, Durham, NC, United States of America, saed.alizamir@duke.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Francis de Vericourt, Peng Sun</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Incentive policies such as Feed-In-Tariff (FIT) are used by governments to promote green technologies toward market integration. In this paper, we model the widespread of a new green technology and the contributing factors such as learning curve and diffusion process, using a dynamic program. We study the optimal design of FIT policies and gain insights into how the government should dynamically adjust the prices or tariff levels as the technology grows.</br>
