        <br>Title: Complementary Benefits of Software Piracy - An Empirical Analysis of Piracy and PC Ownership</br><br>Author: Bin Gu, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Austin, CBA 5.202, B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States, Bin.Gu@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Prabhudev Konana</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This study considers the benefits of software piracy to the PC industry. Using a panel data on piracy and PC ownership from 77 countries from 1994 to 2002, we find that software piracy brings significant benefits to the PC industry. The effects are particularly pronounced for developing countries. The result indicates that prior studies may have overestimated the cost of piracy without taking into consideration its benefits to complementary industries.</br>
