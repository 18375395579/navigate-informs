        <br>Title: Effort and Quality in Online Crowdsourced Markets: Influence of Global Economic and Cultural Factors</br><br>Author: Jesse Bockstedt, University of Arizona, 1130 E. Helen St., Tucson, AZ, 85721, United States of America, bockstedt@email.arizona.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cheryl Druehl, Anant Mishra</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: One emerging consequence of crowdsourcing is increased competition in global labor markets for digital work. We analyze how economic and cultural factors influence the effort and quality of work contributed to these new virtual labor markets.  Using data from a popular online logo design contest site we demonstrate that GDP per capita, broadband penetration, and Hofstede's cultural dimensions are strong predictors of a global digital worker's effort and work quality.</br>
