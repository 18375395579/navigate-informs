        <br>Title: Social Networks and Information Flow</br><br>Author: Bernardo Huberman, Senior Fellow, HP Labs, 1501 Page Mill Rd, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, United States, bernardo.huberman@hp.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Given email’s ubiquity, it can reveal the hidden patterns of collaboration and leadership as well as the dynamics of information exchange within large social networks. This talk will describe several studies that have revealed the structure of informal communities within an enterprise, and surprising regularities among the millions of messages exchanged within an online social network. Finally, I will show how recommendation cascades within such networks affect the viral propagation of news.</br>
