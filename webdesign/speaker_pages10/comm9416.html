        <br>Title: Optimal Bargaining Power in an Entrepreneurial Market Process</br><br>Author: Mohammad Keyhani, York University, 4700 Keele St., Schulich School of Business, Toronto, On, M3J 1P3, Canada, mkeyhani08@schulich.yorku.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Moren Lévesque</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We investigate the role of bargaining power in the economic returns to agents engaged in repeated cooperative games over time representing an entrepreneurial market process in line with the Austrian economics of entrepreneurship. We find that as expected, players with greater bargaining power accrue greater returns under various conditions, but under certain conditions closer to the Kirznerian school of thought the pattern is more complicated and not necessarily monotonic.</br>
