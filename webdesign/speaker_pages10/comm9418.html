        <br>Title: Marketing Green Behavior Change: Seeding Norm-driven Moral-Motivation in Social Networks</br><br>Author: Gwen Spencer, Nuekom Fellow, Dartmouth College, 19A Maple Street, Hanover, NH, 03755, United States of America, gwenspencer@gmail.com</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In public management and private life, decisions to adopt sustainable behaviors often carry personal costs. In turn, these behaviors contribute to environmental quality (a common good). Ecological economists suggest that individuals feel personal responsibility to adopt green behaviors when many others also chip in.  This motivates a model of how environmentally-friendly norms spread (and stabilize) in networks. Theoretical and computational results depart strongly from information spread.</br>
