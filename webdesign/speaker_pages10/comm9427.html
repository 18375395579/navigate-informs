        <br>Title: Interaction Effects of Knowledge Component Interdependence and Uncertainty on R&D Scope</br><br>Author: Sebastian Fixson, MIT Sloan School of Management, 30 Wadsworth St, E53-343, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States, fixson@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Won Hee Lee</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: With this paper we investigate how firms change their R&D scope as a response to changes of technological uncertainty. We suggest that the relationship between technological uncertainty and R&D scope is moderated by the interdependence of knowledge components in a product. In an empirical study we find that the decrease of firms' R&D scope with increasing uncertainty is much stronger in high component interdependence regimes than in regimes of low component interdependence.</br>
