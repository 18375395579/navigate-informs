        <br>Title: Optimal Timing of Sequential Distribution: The Impact of Congestion and Day-and-Date Strategies</br><br>Author: Duy Dao, University of California-San Diego, Rady School of Management, San Diego, CA, United States of America, duy.dao@rady.ucsd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Terrence August, Hyoduk Shin</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: The window between a film's theatrical and video releases has been declining with some studios now testing day-and-date strategy (releasing different versions simultaneously). We study the optimal video release timing and the video pricing strategies for studios. We present a consumer choice model that examines trade-offs between substitutable products (theatrical and video formats), the possibility of purchasing both alternatives, and a congestion externality affecting consumption at theaters.</br>
