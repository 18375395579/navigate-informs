        <br>Title: Exploration and Exploitation in Complex Networks: Learning Rates and Interpersonal Networks</br><br>Author: Melissa Schilling, Associate Professor of Management, Stern School of Business, New York University, 40 West Fourth Street, New York, NY, 10012, United States, mschilli@stern.nyu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The rate at which superior solutions spread through an interpersonal network is strongly influenced by the learning rate utilized by individuals and the underlying network structure. We find that very low levels of random linking increase performance, but higher levels of random linking lower performance. Small-world network properties can enhance organizational learning by enabling short path lengths and semi-isolated pockets of heterogeneous knowledge to exist simultaneously in a network.</br>
