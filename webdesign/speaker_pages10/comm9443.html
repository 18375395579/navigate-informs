        <br>Title: Incentives of Contingent Options in Mutual Insurance</br><br>Author: John Liu, Lgtjliu@polyu.edu.hk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jiguang Yuan</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: A key drawback of mutual insurance is its indistinguishable principal-agent structure.  As a result, typical revelation mechanisms (e.g., non-linear deduction-based premium, etc.) can hardly be implemented in mutual insurance.  Intrigued by the fact that P&I Club, a marine mutual insurance with linear premium (i.e., tonnage-based premium rate), has over 150 strong years of history, we in this paper intend to examine alternative revelation scheme in mutual insurance.</br>
