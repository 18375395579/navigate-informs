        <br>Title: A MDP Based Optimal Price Markdown Tool</br><br>Author: Martin Puterman, Professor, Sauder School of Business UBC, 2053 Main Mall #470, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z2, Canada, Martin.Puterman@sauder.ubc.ca</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: While driving to our monthly poker game, my buddy, Frank, (owner of Current Fashions) noted, “Last year was awful, we marked down prices too late and our competitors really socked it to us!? Frank’s situation is not unique; retailers globally face this challenge. To help Frank, I developed an interactive Excel tool for use in teaching both MDPs and revenue management.  Using it the student can investigate sensitivity of the optimal markdown strategy to inputs and compare it to other strategies.</br>
