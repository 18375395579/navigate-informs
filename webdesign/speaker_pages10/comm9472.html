        <br>Title: Presence and Productivity in Virtual and Blended Workplaces</br><br>Author: Lamar Reinsch, Professor of Management, Georgetown University, Old North Building, Washington, DC, 20057, United States of America, reinschl@georgetown.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jeanine Turner, Rebecca Heino</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We offer the concept of interpersonal presence to clarify how persons use CMC and other technologies to project, imply, obscure, and allocate participation across multiple interactions. This concept can facilitate the study of CMC in organizational settings, settings in which participants increasingly use CMC to enhance or restrict accessibility, to unobtrusively monitor and influence interactions, and to participte in multiple simultaneous interactions, that is, to multicommunicate.</br>
