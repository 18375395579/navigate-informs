        <br>Title: Risk and Return of Information Technology Initiatives: Evidence from Electronic Commerce Announcements</br><br>Author: Fei Ren, PhD Candidate, University of California, Irvine, The Paul Merage School of Business, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697, United States, fren01@merage.uci.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sanjeev Dewan</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: This paper jointly examines wealth and risk effects of eCommerce announcements using event study. We estimate a generalized model allowing both systematic and unsystematic risk changes on 1996-2002 data. A striking result is wealth effects are not significant, inside or outside the Internet bubble, after controlling contemporaneous risk changes, which are quite significant. With a variety of robustness tests, it contributes to our nascent understanding of how IT affects firm risk-return profile.</br>
