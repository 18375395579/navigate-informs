        <br>Title: Exploring Organizational Identity and Organizational Design in Technological Transitions</br><br>Author: Mary Tripsas, Associate Professor, Harvard Business School, 219 Rock Center, Soldiers Field Rd, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, mtripsas@hbs.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Innovation research suggests that a separate new technology unit with its own identity increases the odds of a successful technological transformation. Identity research, however, has shown that multiple identities can be harmful, posing a dilemma. Through a comparison of FujiFilm and Polaroid’s reactions to digital imaging, we propose that establishing a separate new technology unit can cause dormant identity conflicts to surface, and reconciling those conflicts is critical to success.</br>
