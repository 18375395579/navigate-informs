        <br>Title: Linking the Cash-to-cash Cycle to Corporate Performance</br><br>Author: David A. Menachof, Sr. Lecturer in International Logistics, Cass Business School, City University, 106 Bunhill Row, London, EC1Y 8TZ, United Kingdom, d.menachof@city.ac.uk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study will attempt to link Cash-to-Cash(C-to-C) cycle (a key SC performance metric) and corporate performance on a global scale; an empirical link that is so far missing to date.  The implication is that the clearer the link, the more incentive the SC Manager has to actively manage this recognized metric.</br>
