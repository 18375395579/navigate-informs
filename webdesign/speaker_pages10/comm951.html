        <br>Title: On the Boundaries of Mass-customization: A Real World Case Study</br><br>Author: Silvia Ponce, Associate Professor, HEC Montreal, 3000, Ch.Cote-Ste-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 2A7, Canada, Silvia.Ponce@hec.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Valerie Paquin</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Mass-customization departs from traditional production systems and manufacturing strategies as described by Hayes & Wheelwright’s product-process matrix and Skinner’s focused-factories. Trade-offs between variety and volume, and among manufacturing-outputs, seem meaningless. Ulrich’s theory of boundary critique helps to understand a real-world case showing that mass customization boundaries are not always sharp.</br>
