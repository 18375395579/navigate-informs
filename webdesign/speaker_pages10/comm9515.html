        <br>Title: Precision Airdrop: C-5M vs C-17</br><br>Author: Alan Johnson, Air Force Institute of Technology, AFIT/ENS, 2950 Hobson Way, Bldg 641, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433, United States of America, alan.johnson@afit.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We compare the costs of using the Joint Precision Airdrop System with the C-5M aircraft versus the C-17 platform currently used.  Our research question is that the C-5M’s greater range and payload capacity renders it a more cost-effective overall delivery platform.  To test this hypothesis, we created a spreadsheet-based model that combines planning factors and optimization to estimate the cost associated with a wide range of payloads and mission distances.</br>
