        <br>Title: How Online Social Media Changes Volunteer Recruitment</br><br>Author: Amy Connolly, Doctoral Candidate, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, CIS1040, Tampa, FL, 33620, United States of America, ajconnol@usf.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Anol Bhattacherjee</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Volunteer recruitment in organizations poses a unique problem, because volunteers are not simply unpaid employees. Volunteers have competing demands on their time, and quality volunteers can be hard to find. This paper considers the role of online social media in attracting new volunteers to join the organization. We extend theories from psychology, sociology and information systems, to test the impact of online social media on an individual's willingness to volunteer.</br>
