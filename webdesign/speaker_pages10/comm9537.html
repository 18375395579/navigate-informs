        <br>Title: The Diffusion of No-Regrets Environmental Technologies</br><br>Author: Karl Ulrich, Professor, The Wharton School, 500 Huntsman Hall, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, United States, ulrich@wharton.upenn.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The International Panel on Climate Change reports that global greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by more than 2 gigatonnes of carbon per year at no net cost.
