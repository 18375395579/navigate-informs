        <br>Title: Analysis of Cellular and Wireline Voice Convergence in the Consumer Market</br><br>Author: Abdol Saleh, Lucent Technologies, Business Modeling Department, 101 Crawfords Corner Road, Holmdel, NJ, 07733, United States, asaleh@lucent.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yuliy Baryshnikov</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: To provide converged Cellular/Wireline services, telecom operators seek clear economic drivers to develop service offer strategies.  We study the impact of factors, such as market segment characteristics, price sensitivity, network investment, service bundling, operation cost and service differentiation in an environment where various operators adopt different go-to-market strategies. We quantify the impact of these strategies on market share acquisition and churn reduction for each operator.</br>
