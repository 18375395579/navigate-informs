        <br>Title: Capabilities of the IS Applications Portfolio and Relational Value in Inter-Firm Partnerships</br><br>Author: Nilesh Saraf, Assistant Professor, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive WMC 3323, Burnaby, BC, Canada, nsaraf@sfu.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sanjay Gosain, Christoph Schlueter Langdon</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We examine how the Information Systems applications portfolio contributes to the performance of business units, specifically focusing on process coupling and knowledge sharing in the extended enterprise as mediating mechanisms. Cross-sectional survey-based data shows that IS integration contributes to both mediators, which in turn contribute partially to performance. IS flexibility is a foundational capability contributing indirectly by enabling greater inter-firm IS integration.</br>
