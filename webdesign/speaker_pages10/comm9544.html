        <br>Title: The Role of Online Reviews in Mitigating Product Uncertainties</br><br>Author: Wael Jabr, Assistant Professor, University of Calgary, 2500 University Dr NW, Calgary, AB, T3A6L5, Canada, wjabr@ucalgary.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Mohammad Rahman</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: User reviews are widely recognized as an important resource that customers rely on to help guide their purchases. This paper evaluates the efficiency of the market for information at reducing the uncertainty of consumers. We use Bayesian Belief and Information Gain to quantify such efficiency. We then show that the market design for information release plays a major role in affecting this efficiency. We investigate the evolution of reviews and corresponding efficiencies and market design issues.</br>
