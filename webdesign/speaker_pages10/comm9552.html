        <br>Title: Planning for Equipment Rental and the Traveling Equipment Problem</br><br>Author: Hakan Yildiz, Michigan State University, 632 Bogue St. N341, North Business College Complex, East Lansing, MI, 48824, United States of America, yildiz@bus.msu.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We study a business model that provides services using its equipment, which are stored in a network of warehouses. We consider this problem in the context of seating and staging services in the entertainment industry, where the planning process is quite complicated as it involves managing thousands of pieces of modular equipment among warehouses and events, such as concerts and sports games. We investigate improvement opportunities in terms of inventory & transportation management and pricing.</br>
