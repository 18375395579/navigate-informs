        <br>Title: The Influence of Career Concerns on Task Choice: Experimental Evidence</br><br>Author: Enno Siemsen, Assistant Professor, University of Illinois, 350 Wohler Hall, 1206 S. Sixth Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, United States of America, siemsen@uiuc.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Elena Katok</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We use an experiment to test how people with career concerns select the difficulty of their organizational tasks. We subject participants to a context in which they act as agents for a principal. They have to convince this principal of their capability. To do so, they can increase the difficulty of their assigned task. The data from the experiment supports the notion that people can have a tendency to choose a more difficult solution as this choice increases their expected reputation.</br>
