        <br>Title: Logistics Contracts in Manufacturing</br><br>Author: Osman Engin Alper, University of California, IEOR, Berkeley, CA, 94530, United States, engin@ieor.berkeley.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Hyun-Soo Ahn, Phil Kaminsky</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: The value of integrating production and logistics operations is increasingly appreciated by managers, while at the same time logistics outsourcing is becoming a more prevalent across many industries.
