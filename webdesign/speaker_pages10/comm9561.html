        <br>Title: Collocation Matters: Conformance Quality and the Interdependence of R&D and Manufacturing</br><br>Author: Enno Siemsen, Associate Professor, University of Minnesota, 3-150 Carlson School of Management, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, United States of America, siems017@umn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Gurneeta Vasudeva, John Gray</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study investigates the manufacturing conformance quality benefits of collocating manufacturing units with research and development (R&D) activities using a large panel dataset of U.S. based pharmaceutical plants. The benefits of collocation are stable throughout the time period studied, which is surprising given the rapid development of advanced communication technologies in that period. However, the benefits of collocation are contingent on certain firm- and plant-specific characteristics.</br>
