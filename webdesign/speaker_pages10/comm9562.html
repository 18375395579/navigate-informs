        <br>Title: Integrating Ecosystems Values into Policy Decisions</br><br>Author: Chiew Chong, Senior Enconomist, Environment Canada, 10 Wellington Street, 25th Floor, Gatineau, QC, K1A 0H3, Canada, chiew.chong@ec.gc.ca</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper outlines waterfowl values to hunters in America supported by ecosystems in northern Canada. It analyzes how probabilities are used in estimating benefits from mining, and trade-offs of ecosystems values, and its support to climate change and policy research. It reveals how geo-referenced values will promote mining development and conservation of species identified as at risks. Therefore, it recommends integrating ecosystems values into policy decisions in the future.</br>
