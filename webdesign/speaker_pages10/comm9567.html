        <br>Title: Network Effects: The Influence of Quality and Diversity of Ties on Value of Software Innovation</br><br>Author: Ram Gopal, University of Connecticut, University of Connecticut, School of Business, 2100 Hillside Road, Storrs, CT, 06269, United States of America, Ram.Gopal@business.uconn.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Xinxin Li, Harpreet Singh</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Software innovations are heterogeneous in value with majority of them worth little. In this study, we investigate the impact of network social capital on value of software innovation. Based on empirical analysis on software patents data, we find that the count of quality weighted external direct contacts of a team and regional diversity of contacts significantly influence the value of innovation while the count of quality weighted external indirect contacts of a team has no significant impact.</br>
