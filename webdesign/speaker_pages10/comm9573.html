        <br>Title: Is Corporate Social Responsibility Good for IS Security?</br><br>Author: John D'Arcy, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, United States of America, jdarcy@udel.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Using a combined dataset of security breaches (2005-2010) and ratings on over 30 different dimensions of corporate social responsibility (CSR), we explore the relationship between CSR and IS security breaches. Drawing on signaling theory, we hypothesize that internal breaches are less likely as CSR practices increase. However, we also predict a positive relationship between CSR and external breaches. Contingency factors that influence these relationships will be discussed.</br>
