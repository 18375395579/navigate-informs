        <br>Title: Carbon Tariffs: Effects in Settings with Technology Choice and Foreign Comparative Advantage</br><br>Author: David Drake, Assistant Professor, Harvard Business School, Morgan Hall 425, Boston, MA, 02163, United States of America, ddrake@hbs.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: When firms can choose from a set of potential production technologies and foreign firms hold a comparative cost advantage, I show that carbon leakage due to offshoring and/or foreign entry can result despite the implementation of a carbon tariff. However, in such a setting, carbon leakage is shown to conditionally decrease global emissions, contradicting prevailing popular opinion and widely reported results that do not account for technology choice or foreign comparative cost advantage.</br>
