        <br>Title: Switching To Servicizing Systems: Agent Based Modeling Approach</br><br>Author: Vered Blass, Lecturer, Tel Aviv University, PO Box 39787, Tel Aviv, 61397, Israel, vblass@post.tau.ac.il</br><br>Coauthor(s): Igor Nikolic, Reinier van der, Tzruya Chebach</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Servicizing systems which are grounded on consuming functions rather than products could lead to economic and environmental benefits. The fact that both production and consumption patterns can be modified provide a unique opportunity to test under what conditions Servicizing can happen and the consequences of such shift. We present agent based approach and a model that was developed for testing the emergence of Servicizing systems and measure the potential consequences at the value chain level.</br>
