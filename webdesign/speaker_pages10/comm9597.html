        <br>Title: Strategic Manipulation of Internet Opinion Forums: Implications for Consumers and Firms</br><br>Author: Chrysanthos Dellarocas, R. H.

This paper analyzes the impact of such behavior on firm profits and consumer surplus. Contrary to intuition, we show that strategic firm manipulation can sometimes help consumers better assess the true qualities of competing products and, thus, improves the information value of online forums to consumers.</br>
