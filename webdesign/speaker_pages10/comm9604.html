        <br>Title: The Effect of NPD Team Structure on Project Termination Decisions</br><br>Author: Stylianos Kavadias, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States, Stylianos.Kavadias@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nektarios Oraiopoulos</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Numerous cases from the industry have indicated strong escalation phenomena among New Product Development (NPD) teams that led to monumental failures. We study the termination decision by modeling NPD teams as groups of decision makers that may evaluate the incoming information differently and thus result in diverse decisions on whether the project should continue or not. Our results indicate the detrimental effect of high dispersion of information perception among team members.</br>
