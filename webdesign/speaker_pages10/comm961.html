        <br>Title: Complementary Product Innovations in Competitive Supply Chains</br><br>Author: Ayhan Aydin, Assistant Professor of Information Systems and Operations Management, George Mason University, School of Management, 4400 University Dr, Fairfax, VA, 22030, United States of America, ayhan.aydin.us@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Dan Adelman, Rodney Parker</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Development of core (upstream) technologies by competitive industries depends on their diffusion in different downstream ones. Downstream firms may also need to invest to be able to use them. We investigate the effects of different industry and firm factors on the complementary R&D investments of two tiers of oligopolies. These investments improve the upstream technology and the final products?capabilities. We discuss which supply chain structures are more conducive to product innovations.</br>
