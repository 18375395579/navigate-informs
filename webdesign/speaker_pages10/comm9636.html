        <br>Title: Structuring Global Product Development</br><br>Author: Anshuman Tripathy, PhD Student, MIT-Sloan School of Management, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E53-388, Cambridge, MA, 02142, United States of America, atripathy@sloan.mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven Eppinger</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Distributed and offshore product development is challenged by product and process architecture constraints and high coordination costs.  We propose an evolving Global Product Development (GPD) structure model incorporating the influence of coordination costs and learning effects.  Through an example of optimizing an existing GPD organization, we observe that, contrary to conventional literature, offshoring need not increase with modularity of tasks.</br>
