        <br>Title: Centralization vs Decentralization and Referral Rate: A Behavioral Perspective</br><br>Author: Rosa Hendijani, PhD Candidate, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N4, Canada, rosa.hendijani@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Diane Bischak</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study examines centralization versus decentralization from a behavioral perspective. We designed an experiment to examine how a shift from a decentralized referral system, characterized by a close relationship between general practitioners and specialists, to a centralized referral system would affect referral rate. The results indicated that high confidence doctors referred significantly fewer patients in a close-relationship condition in comparison with the centralized referral system.</br>
