        <br>Title: Dynamic Complexity in Love and Interfirm Rivalry</br><br>Author: John Morecroft, Senior Fellow, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, UK, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, jmorecroft@london.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A tiny model of dynamic complexity in a love relationship paves the way for modelling and simulation of interfirm rivalry in fast-moving consumer goods.  Strategic insights into the launch of liquid soap products (and their growth dynamics) are reported.  The role of modelling in such strategic development is discussed.</br>
