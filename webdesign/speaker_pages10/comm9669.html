        <br>Title: A Service Classification Framework based on Joint Production</br><br>Author: Guillaume Roels, UCLA, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States of America, guillaume.roels@anderson.ucla.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This paper analyzes the economics of joint production in services between a customer and a service provider. We study how efforts change when they become more complementary and when their distribution shifts from one party to the other. Our analysis give rise to a product-process matrix for services with three extreme working modes: independent processing by the provider, independent processing by the customer, and direct interaction.</br>
