        <br>Title: Uncertainty Analysis of a Mass Flow and Economic Model of Electronics Recycling Systems</br><br>Author: Jeremy Gregory, Research Scientist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, E38-424, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, jgregory@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Boma Brown-West, Randolph Kirchain</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: As electronics recycling systems become more widespread, analyzing the performance of such systems is critical for the evaluation of existing systems and the design of new ones. This work involves performance analysis of electronics recycling systems using a mass flow and economic model that quantifies the variation in economic performance of a recycling system due to product, collection, and market uncertainties. The goal is to highlight scenarios that may lead to economic success.</br>
