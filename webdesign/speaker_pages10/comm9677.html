        <br>Title: Performance Measurement in Collaborative Product Development</br><br>Author: Paulo Gomes, Assistant Professor, Universidade Nova Lisboa, Campus de Campolide, Lisbon, PT, 1099-032, Portugal, pgomes@fe.unl.pt</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: We offer a framework that identifies key metrics and integration points across collaborative development processes. We identify areas in which these metrics may be misaligned. We discuss how goal setting, measurement, adaptation and corrective actions determine the effectiveness of outcomes in terms of the desired alignment.</br>
