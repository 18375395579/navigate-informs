        <br>Title: Mining Product Discussion Forums for Market Structure</br><br>Author: Ronen Feldman, School Of Business Administration, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, ronenf@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Jacob Goldenberg, Oded Netzer, Lyle Ungar</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Product discussion forums are a potential rich source of information  about how users view different products. Researchers and practitioners  are starting to extract user sentiment about products from user  product reviews. Users often compare different products, stating which  they like better and why. We present a case study in extracting  information about comparisons between cars, and running shoes,  describe an effective methodology, and show how it produces insight  into how consumers view the running shoe market and the cars market.</br>
