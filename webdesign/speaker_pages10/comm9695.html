        <br>Title: Market Watch: Information and Availability Cascades in the U.S. IPO Market</br><br>Author: Tim Pollock, Associate Professor of Management, Smeal College of Business, Pennsylvania State University, 417 Business Building, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, tpollock@psu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Patrick Maggitti, Violina Rindova</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this study we advance current research on the dynamics of social influence in markets by examining how information and availability cascades influence the attentional and evaluative choices that the media and investors make about newly public firms. We integrate emerging theoretical perspectives on information and availability cascades by examining the extent to which the media and investors follow the logics of each type of cascade in deciding which firms to focus their attention on and how to evaluate them. We extend current research on cascades by positing that the choices of market participants reflect both intra-cascade effects arising from imitation of others in one’s own professional community, and inter-cascade effects arising from efforts to glean information from the choices of others in another relevant professional community.</br>
