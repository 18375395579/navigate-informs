        <br>Title: Volatility and Valuation of Early Stage Firms with Jump Risk</br><br>Author: Nalin Kulatilaka, Wing Tat Lee Family Professor of Management, Professor of Finance, Boston University, School of Management, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, United States, nalink@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Feng Shu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We model early-stage firms as sequences of call options leading to mature firms, thus, volatility is critical to proper valuation. Ignoring jumps due to innovations or failure results in over-estimates of volatility. The impact on firm value also depends on whether the option is away-from or at-the money (investment requirement). Our results explain why volatility of firms undergoes discrete reductions when clearing investment stages and provide new insights regarding over- and under-valuation.</br>
