        <br>Title: Free Riding and Leadership Structure in Collaborative Projects</br><br>Author: Morvarid Rahmani, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree, N.W., Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, morvarid.rahmani@scheller.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Uday Karmarkar, Guillaume Roels</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Knowledge-based projects are inherently team-based and their major resource is labor.  We study the effect of leadership on effort choice and free riding in such projects. We show that there is always effort under-provision when members choose their effort. With a leader, there could be effort under- or over-provision. Comparing the efficiency of the two structures, we show that letting team members decide their effort generates a higher total surplus when both project reward and team are small.</br>
