        <br>Title: Organizational Strategy and Supply Chain Architecture: A Multi-method Study of Supply Disruptions</br><br>Author: Laird Burns, Michigan State University, N370 North Business Complex, Eli Broad Graduate School of Business, East Lansing, MI, 48824, United States, burnslai@msu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Steven A. Melnyk</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This study extends classical strategy-structure research by investigating firm performance differences under conditions of supply disruption. This study uses computational modeling to evaluate the interactive aspects of firm strategy, supply chain design/architecture, and risk management/risk planning using empirical firm data and actual supply networks. Implications for academics and practitioners will be presented on these critical areas of research.</br>
