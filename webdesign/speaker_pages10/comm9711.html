        <br>Title: Product Repositioning and Brand Inertia: The US Automobile Market</br><br>Author: Sengun Yeniyurt, Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, Rutgers Business School, 94 Rockafeller Road, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, United States of America, yeniyurt@business.rutgers.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): S. Chan Choi, Janell D. Townsend</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This study investigates factors affecting brand inertia in brand positioning changes over time. A longitudinal perceptual map is generated to track changes in brand positions of 24 major automotive brands competing in the U.S. between 1997 and 2005.  The effects of marketing efforts on changes in brand positioning, moderated by brand familiarity, are then estimated using an econometric model.</br>
