        <br>Title: Trust Formation in the Usage of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing Software</br><br>Author: Heng Xu, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 2, School of Computing, NUS, Singapore, 117543, Singapore, xuheng@comp.nus.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Kai Fischbach</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In this paper, we develop and empirically test a usage intention model which includes trust in the vendor of P2P sharing software and perceived risk as two major antecedent beliefs to the usage intention. Several trust antecedents are also identified in the model. Our preliminary results show the support for the model, and offer some important implications for software vendors in P2P sharing industry and regulatory bodies.</br>
