        <br>Title: An Empirical Analysis of the Survivability of New Sellers in an Online Marketplace</br><br>Author: Xue Tan, University of Washington at Seattle, Mackenzie 350, Seattle, WA, 98195, United States of America, xuetan@uw.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yong Tan, Ming Fan</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In this work, we empirically investigate the survivability of new sellers in a large online marketplace. Using a dataset of 13264 new sellers in a time span of 11 months, we formulate a survival model to estimate the effects of a series of traffic characteristics. We examine the interactive relationship among these traffic characteristics, and validate their time variant effects.</br>
