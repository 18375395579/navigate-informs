        <br>Title: Do Principal-agent Contracts Work in Real Life?</br><br>Author: Kay-Yut Chen, Principal Scientist, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, MS 1U-2, HP Labs, 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, Ca, 94304, United States, kay-yut.chen@hp.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bernardo Huberman, Basak Kalkanci</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We study the agency problem experimentally focusing on two issues. The first tests whether an incentive compatible mechanism performs well. The second addresses the issue of the principal’s lack of knowledge as to how types and effort levels relate to the final outcome. Our results reveal several behavioral effects that reduce the efficiency of the principal-agent mechanism. These behavioral issues may explain why contract designed by principal-agent modeling are seldom used in practice.</br>
