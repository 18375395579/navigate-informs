        <br>Title: Dynamic Testing of Wholesale Power Market Designs: An Agent-Based Computational Approach</br><br>Author: Junjie Sun, Economics PhD Candidate, Iowa State University, Economics Department, 280E Heady Hall, Ames, IA, 50011, United States, jjsun@iastate.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Leigh Tesfatsion</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: In 2003 the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed the Wholesale Power Market Platform (WPMP) for adoption by all U.S. wholesale power markets. Strong opposition to the WPMP persists among some industry stakeholders due largely to a perceived lack of performance testing. In this study we develop an agent-based computational model of a dynamic wholesale power market organized in accordance with core WPMP features, and we report experimental findings for a dynamic 5-node test case.</br>
