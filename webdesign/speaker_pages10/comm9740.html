        <br>Title: A Dynamic Learning Model for Adaptive Licensing</br><br>Author: Adam Elmachtoub, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, United States of America, ane@mit.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Retsef Levi</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: With the increasing ability to collect and utilize data, the pharmaceutical industry is gearing towards a continuous learning approach for drug development, compared to the traditional four phase approach.  Under this new approach, a drug may be released into the market as its quality is gradually understood. As more people take the drug, the quality information increases. Naturally, this leads to several interesting pricing, learning, and information challenges that we consider.</br>
