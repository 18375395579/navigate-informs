        <br>Title: Does Feedback Matter in Crowdsourcing Contests? Theoretical and Empirical Evidences</br><br>Author: Jiahui Mo, Ph.D, University of Texas at Dallas, 800 west campbell road, Richardson, TX, 75080, United States of America, jiahui.mo@utdallas.edu</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: In crowdsourcing contests, a seeker often provides performance feedbacks to solvers. A central problem in crowdsourcing contest is whether feedback matters and how feedback influences solvers' incentives in crowdsourcing contest. This paper builds a theoritical model to investigates the relationship between seeker feedback and solver behavior. Towards the end, using a unique dataset of an online crowdsourcing contest site in China from 2007 to 2010, we empirically test the relationship.</br>
