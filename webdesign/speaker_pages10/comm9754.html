        <br>Title: Using OR to make Urgent Sourcing Decisions in a Distressed Supplier Environment</br><br>Author: Erica Klampfl, Technical Leader, Ford Research & Advanced Engineering, Systems Analytics & Env. Sciences Dept., RIC Bldg, MD #2122, 2101 Village Rd., Dearborn, MI, 48124, United States of America, eklampfl@ford.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yakov Fradkin, Chip McDaniel, Michael Wolcott</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Ford was tasked with determining the best sourcing footprint for its $1.5 billion Automotive Components Holdings, LLC Interiors business. This extensive undertaking required a complete re-engineering of the supply footprint of 42 high-volume product lines over 26 major manufacturing processes and more than 50 potential supplier sites. We present a decision support tool and novel approach to solve the underlying large-scale Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program that resulted in savings of approximately $40 million in upfront investment over the previously preferred alternative.</br>
