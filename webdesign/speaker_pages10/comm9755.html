        <br>Title: Information Technologies and Supply Chain Process Initiatives: Complementary vs. Independent effect</br><br>Author: Pankaj Setia, Michigan State University, N 205 Acc and IS Dept., Eli Broad College, E Lansing, MI, United States, setia@bus.msu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Cornelia Droge, Shawnee Vickery, Vallabhajosyula Sambamurthy</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Recent research on IT value has focused on: i. mediation, through specific capabilities; and, ii. complementarities or synergies between IT and other practices.  Building upon this research, we examine agility as a mediator between the use of IT and firm performance and empirically test complementarities between the specific IT and supply chain initiatives. Results have implications for how manufacturing firms can position their IT investments to enhance their agility and overall performance.</br>
