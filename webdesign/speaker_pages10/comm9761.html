        <br>Title: Framing and Anchoring Effects in Forecast Sharing</br><br>Author: Jud Kenney, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A 1G5, Canada, jud.kenney@mail.mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Saibal Ray, Jim Engle-Warnick</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: This study builds on recent research regarding behavioral issues in the context of forecast sharing (e.g., Özer, Zheng, & Chen, 2011).  Our behavioral experiment establishes and measures the impact of framing and anchoring effects in forecast sharing.  Specifically, our framing treatment attempts to compare and contrast behavior between the retail sector where demand uncertainty plays a major role and sectors such as defense and aerospace, where supply uncertainty dominates demand uncertainty.</br>
