        <br>Title: Digital Innovation and the Division of Innovative Labor: Digital Controls in the Automotive Industry</br><br>Author: Jaegul Lee, Wayne State University, School of Business Administration, 320 Prentis Building 5201 Cass, Detroit, MI, 48202, United States of America, jaegul.lee@wayne.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Much of organizational scholarship holds that, accompanying a shift toward modular structures, suppliers tend to engage in invention around the components they supply.
