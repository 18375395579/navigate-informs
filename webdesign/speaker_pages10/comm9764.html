        <br>Title: Can Social Come to the Rescue? Monetizing Music in the World of Free</br><br>Author: Jui Ramaprasad, Assistant Professor, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, QC, H3H2V1, Canada, jui.ramaprasad@mcgill.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): Genevieve Bassellier, Remi Desmeules</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We examine the role of social media enabled features and shared social responsibility (SSR) on willingness to pay (WTP) for online music. Through a survey-based experiment, we find that a user’s WTP increases if an online music retailer incorporates the ability to build status and includes concepts of SSR in the distribution of revenues. This has implications for online music providers, artists, labels and the music industry as a whole, as well as other digital goods providers.</br>
