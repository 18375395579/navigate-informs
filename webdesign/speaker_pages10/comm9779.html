        <br>Title: A Case-Based Model of Intellectual Property Reuse</br><br>Author: Barrie R. Nault, Professor and Chair, University of Calgary, Haskayne School of Business, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N4, Canada, nault@ucalgary.ca</br><br>Coauthor(s): John D. Mitchell, Victoria L. Mitchell</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Based on cases from the semiconductor industry, we build a model of intellectual property (e.g., software) reuse. We consider designer skills, a reuse repository, and the role of quality standards and incentives. Our results highlight a tradeoff between quality standards motivating reuse while reducing incentives for building new repository contributions.</br>
