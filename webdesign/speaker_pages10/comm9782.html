        <br>Title: Measuring Firm Innovativeness: Towards a Composite Innovation Index Built on Firm Innovative Posture, Propensity and Performance Attributes</br><br>Author: Elias Carayannis, Professor, Department of Information Systems and Technology Management, George Washington University, Washington, DC, 20052, United States of America, caraye@gwu.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The ability to innovate is generally accepted as a critical success factor to growth and future performance of firms. Yet, this acceptance obscures a comprehensive perspective on how firms can influence their innovation capacity and resulting performance. This paper proposes a ?P?construct of innovation measurement that simultaneously considers the posture, propensity and performance related to a firm’s innovative capabilities. We propose and provide empirical support showing that robust measurement of the performance implications of innovation requires simultaneous consideration of input, throughput and output factors. Single or more limited indicators do not offer the degree of fine-tuning to a firm’s innovation system that managers require. Thus, e propose the development, and future research into contingent variations of a Composite Innovation Index. We further demonstrate its use in comparing innovators and allowing managers to design a firm’s innovation system.</br>
