        <br>Title: American Manufacturing - Fading or Phoenix?</br><br>Author: Wallace Hopp, University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-1234, United States of America, whopp@umich.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: By most measures, manufacturing has been shrinking as a part of the U.S. economy for decades.  Prevailing opinion among economists is that this represents a natural, even beneficial, progression toward a post-industrial economy. In contrast, politicians continue to be fond of factory photo ops and soaring rhetoric about the revitalization of American manufacturing.  So what is the truth?  How important is manufacturing to the economy of a developed country?  How healthy is the U.S. manufacturing sector?  Is a new era of manufacturing dawning?  What factors will determine success in the manufacturing landscape of the future?  To address these questions, we examine the economic data and argue that manufacturing in the U.S. is both more central to the economy and more cost competitive than commonly thought.  But we also note that a wide swath of the manufacturing sector is at risk, largely due to non-economic factors.  We discuss the implications of these findings for practice and policy, and highlight research questions where operations research scholars can play important roles in understanding and shaping the future of the manufacturing industry.</br>
