        <br>Title: Causes and Consequences of Entrepreneurial Entry in Bail Bonds</br><br>Author: A.M. Knott, Washington University in St. Louis, knott@wustl.edu</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Entrepreneurial entry is one of the boldest moves in the economy and we don't really understand it very well.  Even Bresnahan and Reiss's, Entry and Competition in Concentrated Markets isn't really about entry per se, it's about the equilibrium number of firms.  While there is prior work examining when we obtain excess entry and whether that entry is beneficial to the economy, that work was in an industry (banking) where entry restrictions are so severe (11 million dollars, prior executive experience, a business plan and demonstrated market void) that firm turnover rates are an order of magnitude lower than in the broader economy.  This study examines a complementary setting (Bail Bonds) where entry is quite liberal (rates are twice the economy average).  This allows us to examine 1) how cross-market variance in regulations affect the rate of entry and 2) how that entry affects innovation (improvement in economic outcomes: incarceration rates, failure to appear rates and fugitive rates).</br>
