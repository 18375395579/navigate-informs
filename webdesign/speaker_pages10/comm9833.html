        <br>Title: Indirect Reciprocity in Contributions to a Peer-to-peer Sharing Network- An Empirical Analysis</br><br>Author: Bin Gu, Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Austin, 2100 Speedway B6500, Austin, TX, 78712, United States of America, Bin.Gu@mccombs.utexas.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yun Huang, Wenjing Duan, Andrew Whinston</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This study assesses the influence of indirect reciprocity on individual contribution to a P2P network.  We find that users show strong indirect reciprocity when they first join the P2P network.  However, their level of indirect reciprocity decreases as the individual gains more experience.  The phenomenon is consistent with findings from economic experiments, suggesting that individuals in the P2P network learn over time to become more economic oriented.</br>
