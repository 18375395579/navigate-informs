Based on a unique dataset of location-based services (Foursquare and Yelp) for restaurants in New York City, we utilize cross-sectional analyses and find that customer engagement exhibits spatial interdependency that persists over time. Our time-series analysis shows that spatial correlation dissipates with distance, indicating a strong agglomeration effect in restaurant industry.</br>
