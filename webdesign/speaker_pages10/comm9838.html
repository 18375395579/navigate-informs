        <br>Title: Component Modularity, Team Network Structure, and Attention to Technical Interdependences</br><br>Author: Manuel Sosa, Professor of Technology and Operations Management, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, 77305, France, manuel.sosa@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Martin Gargiulo, Craig Rowles</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We study the determinants of teams´capability to attend to technical interdependences in complex product development projects. We found that teams?communication network structure plays a critical role on the capacity of teams to attend to their interdependences. Yet, its impact is contingent upon the modularity and redesign of product components.</br>
