        <br>Title: Market Heterogeneity and Local Capacity Decisions in Services</br><br>Author: Dennis Campbell, Harvard Business School, Soldiers Field, Boston, MA, 02153, United States, dcampbell@hbs.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Frances Frei</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: We empirically document factors that influence how local managers balance the tradeoff between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service times.  We find that (1) customer-sensitivities to service time vary predictably with market characteristics;  (2) capacity supply decisions of local managers reflect market specific sensitivity to service time; and  (3) experience affects how local managers evaluate the tradeoff between capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service time.</br>
