        <br>Title: Social Preferences and Performance in Buyer-Supplier Relationships</br><br>Author: Christoph Loch, Professor of Technology Management, INSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, Fontainebleau, France, christoph.loch@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Yaozhong Wu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Economically rational buyer-supplier partners need incentive contracts in order to efficiently coordinate. However, social preferences, or concerns for status, fairness and relationships, can allow parties to collaborate without formal contracts. We show in a model that social preferences can lead to successful coordination, and we show experimental evidence with human subjects that manipulating social concerns in subjects indeed reliably influences their behavior in a buyer-supplier setting.</br>
