        <br>Title: When Users Pledge to Take Green?Actions, Are They Solving a Decision Problem?</br><br>Author: Michael Johnson, PhD, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Boston, 100 Morrissey Blvd., Dept of Public Policy and Public Affairs, Boston, MA, 02124, United States of America, michael.johnson@umb.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Susan Fussell, Deanna Matthews, Jennifer Mankoff</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: A Web-based system provides users with alternative choices of actions to reduce energy consumption. While users in the field have consistently chosen from 60 actions to pursue, laboratory experiments have not indicated any impact of verbal descriptions or graphical representations on decision quality and speed. We examine user actions and descriptions of their actions to determine the extent to which users optimize utility in making action choices and make recommendations for system redesign.</br>
