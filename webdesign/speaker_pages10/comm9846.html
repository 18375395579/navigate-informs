        <br>Title: Market Engineering and Agent-based Simulation</br><br>Author: Clemens van Dinther, Department Manager, Forschungszentrum, Informatik an der Universität Karlsruhe, Haid-und-Neu-Str. 10-14, 76131, Karlsruhe, Germany, vanDinther@fzi.de</br><br>Coauthor(s): Christof Weinhardt</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Bidders normally are not perfectly informed. Rather, people  acquire relevant information over time. The problem of uncertainty about  one’s own valuation is modeled as a Markov Game and studied with an  agent-based model using reinforcement learning. Different settings have been  studied in order to understand changes in the information cost structure,  the participants structure (number and type), and institutional rules. The  data is analyzed regarding 16 hypotheses that were derived from 5 general  research questions and propositions from literature.</br>
