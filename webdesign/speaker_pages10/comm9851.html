        <br>Title: Pharmaceutical-Biotechnology R&D: Implications for Alliance Performance</br><br>Author: Jongwook Kim, Assistant Professor, Western Washington University, 351 Parks Hall MS9075, 516 High Street, Bellingham, WA, 98225, United States, JongWook.Kim@wwu.edu</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Alliance opportunities are often characterized by information asymmetry, particularly where key resources are intellectual property. In the context of biotechnology-pharmaceutical alliances, I test how alliance characteristics impact performance. The data support the claim that utilization of network ties may be informational in nature where the role of reputation and network ties in latter stages diminish as the odds of success are higher, and more emphasis is placed on firm competence.</br>
