        <br>Title: Dynamic Managerial Capabilities and Adaptive Change</br><br>Author: Margaret Peteraf, Professor of Strategic Management and Organization, Tuck School of Business at Darmouth, 100 Tuck Hall, Hanover, NH, 03755, United States, Margaret.A.Peteraf@Dartmouth.EDU</br><br>Coauthor(s): Randal Reed</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: This paper explores the question of how the differential exercise of  managerial choice can facilitate organizational adaptation and improve  efficiency over periods of regulatory change. This is an adaptive  mechanism that helps firms adjust to environmental change or maneuver  over a rugged landscape.  We view this as a type of dynamic managerial  capability for achieving dynamic fit under changing conditions.</br>
