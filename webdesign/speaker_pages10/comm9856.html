        <br>Title: Online Expert Elicitation Tools: Development and Case Studies in Energy Technology Assessment</br><br>Author: Steve Davis, Senior Research Associate, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 260 Panama Strett, Stanford, CA, 94305, United States of America, sjdavis@dge.stanford.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Karen Fries</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We are developing innovative tools to facilitate online expert elicitation in order to reduce the time and resources required to characterize uncertainty and the sources/scope of disagreement among experts. Such characterization is critical to directing R&D efforts on technical topics. We focus on experts?subjective judgments on energy technologies. Here we demonstrate the tools under development and present results of testing with experts on solar PV and airborne wind energy systems.</br>
