        <br>Title: Holding PBL to its Promise ?the Analytical Challenge</br><br>Author: John Millhouse, Chief Scientist, TFD Group, 70 Garden Court, Suite 300, Monterey, CA, 93940, United States of America, john.millhouse@tfdg.com</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: If PBL has an Achilles heel, it is that incentives may fail to induce support providers to invest enough in resources to ensure support recipients get the things they need, where and when they need them.   An illustration of what can go wrong has been derived through use of readiness-based sparing techniques to evaluate the likely performance outcomes of applying actual incentive provisions of an existing PBL contract to the spares support of a notional weapon system.</br>
