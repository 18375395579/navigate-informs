        <br>Title: Optimizing the Resource Allocation of an Entrepreneur: The Role of Learning Externalities</br><br>Author: Onesun Yoo, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, onesun.yoo@ucl.ac.uk</br><br>Coauthor(s): Bilal Gokpinar, Yufei Huang</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: We study the problem of an entrepreneur trying to sell his service to two potential buyers by providing them information about the service. Buyers learn and update their beliefs about the service quality both directly from the entrepreneur himself, and indirectly through the purchase decision of the other buyer. By developing an analytical model, we characterize this learning and purchasing process, and analyze the optimal resource allocation policy for the entrepreneur.</br>
