        <br>Title: An Exploration of Inter-Organizational Heterogeneity in Organizational Goal Setting</br><br>Author: Cynthia Penaflor, Research Assistant, Brigham Young University, 2112 Margalene Way, Austin, TX, 78728, United States of America, cynthiapenaflor@gmail.com</br><br>Coauthor(s): Peter Madsen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Limited availability of data on organizational goals has necessitated the imputation of organizational goals in empirical tests of the behavioral theory of the firm; but this approach cannot account for inter-organizational heterogeneity in goal setting. Our project plans to overcome this challenge by analyzing newly-available data from all companies that have been members of the S&P 500 index from 2006-2011. We test how closely imputed goals approach self-reported organizational goals.</br>
