        <br>Title: A Probabilistic Preference Model with Applications to Electricity Tariff Choice</br><br>Author: Markus Peters, PhD Candidate, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, 3062PA, Netherlands, peters@rsm.nl</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wolf Ketter</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: Information systems that make autonomous decisions based on consumers?preferences will play an important role in the smart retail electricity markets of the future. We present a computational preference model that learns unobtrusively from limited data and that quantifies the certainty of its own predictions as input to autonomous decision-making tasks. We evaluate our model on real-world tariff preference data collected through a commercial crowdsourcing platform.</br>
