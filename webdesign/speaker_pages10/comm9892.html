        <br>Title: “Look at me! Look at me!? The Competitive Dynamic of Wikis and Online Communities</br><br>Author: Brian Butler, University of Pittsburgh, 226 Mervis Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States of America, bbutler@katz.pitt.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Web 2.0 systems, such as wikis and online communities, are often assumed to be spontaneous, emergent, collaborative structures.
