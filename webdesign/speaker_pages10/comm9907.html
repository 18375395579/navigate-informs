        <br>Title: Transaction Utility and Culture</br><br>Author: Kim Huat Goh, Assistant Professor, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue S3-B2A-34, Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technol, Singapore, Si, 639798, Singapore, akhgoh@ntu.edu.sg</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sharon Ng</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We examine the impacts of culture on consumers?transaction utility. We argue that Easterners have steeper transaction utility functions than Westerners. We found that the higher transaction utility experienced by Easterners is associated with higher arousal levels.  We conducted studies to isolate the effects of higher transaction utilities; to measure higher levels of arousal in Easterners (scale and skin conductance measures); to refute alternative explanations and test boundary conditions.</br>
