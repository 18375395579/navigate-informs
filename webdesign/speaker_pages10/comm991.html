        <br>Title: Impact of Yield Uncertainty on Cournot Competition: Case of the US Influenza Vaccine Market</br><br>Author: Sarang Deo, PhD Candidate, UCLA Anderson School of Management, 110 Westwood Plaza Gold Hall B501, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, United States, sdeo@anderson.ucla.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Charles Corbett</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: Current economic theory predicts that a market characterized by Cournot competition post-entry will experience excess entry and oversupply. However, we show that presence of yield uncertainty in the production process can result in less entry and production than is socially optimal. Using parameter values that approximately represent the US influenza vaccine market, we show that our model offers one potential explanation for the high degree of concentration and undersupply recently observed.</br>
