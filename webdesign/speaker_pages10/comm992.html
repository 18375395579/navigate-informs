        <br>Title: Deployment of Food Desert Remedies in Urban Areas</br><br>Author: Christopher Wishon, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States of America, Christopher.Wishon@asu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Nicholas Mason, Rene Villalobos</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: The existence of urban food deserts, areas with limited access to healthy and affordable food, and their relationship to obesity rates is an ongoing debate. Some remedies to food deserts include opening new supermarkets, introducing farmers markets, or starting urban farm trucks (a commercial vehicle selling fresh foods). This research seeks to identify a method to determine which remedy to employ based on the region with respect to costs, potential health benefits, and environmental factors.</br>
