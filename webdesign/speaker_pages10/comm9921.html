        <br>Title: A Comparison of Regime-switching Models for Electricity Spot Price</br><br>Author: Dipeng Chen, PhD candidate, London Business School, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, dipengchen.phd2004@london.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Derek Bunn</br><br>Year: 2007</br><br>Abstract: Through analysing the complex relationship between British spot price dynamics and fundamental/strategic factors under Markov regime-switching and logistic smooth transition modelling frameworks, we gain a better understanding of the market. In addition to including conventional fundamentals, this work also studies the influence from high-frequency market structure variables as well as the carbon emission trading on spot price. Two models?forecasting performances are also compared.</br>
