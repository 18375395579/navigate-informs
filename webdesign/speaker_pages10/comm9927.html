        <br>Title: Institutional Environments & Network Emergence: The Case of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research</br><br>Author: Jeff Furman, Assistant Professor, Boston University, 595 Commonwealth Ave - 653a, Boston, MA, 02215, United States of America, furman@bu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Fiona Murray</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: This paper examines the role of institutional environments on the emergence of scientific networks.  Specifically, we consider the case of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research. We exploit the fact that key research materials are subject to different IP restrictions in the US and Europe to examine the relationship between institutional environments and the growth and structure of the hESC research communities.</br>
