        <br>Title: Not all Cloud Users are Equal: Who Benefits from Technical Support?</br><br>Author: German Retana, PhD Candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology, 800 West Peachtree NW, Atlanta, GA, 30308, United States of America, german.retana@mgt.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Chris Forman, Sridhar Narasimhan, Marius Florin Niculescu, D.J. Wu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Based on an analysis of firm-level data on cloud infrastructure services usage, we examine how customer-level attributes moderate the effects of support on customer demand for the service. We find, for example, that the younger customers are, the stronger the positive effect that adopting higher levels of support has on their demand for IT capacity and on their ability to employ the advanced features of the cloud.</br>
