        <br>Title: Analysis of Role of Service Variety and Real Options in Resort Timeshare Service Value</br><br>Author: Gregory Heim, Associate Professor, Mays Business School at Texas A&M University, 320 Wehner Building, 4217 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843-4217, United States of America, gheim@mays.tamu.edu</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Although a major class of hospitality/travel experience service, little empirical research has examined timeshares or other fractional hospitality services. This paper examines whether service variety, in terms of breadth of vacation service experiences, or real options more strongly affect the perceived quality, valuation, and ownership of resort hotel timeshare services. We analyze hypotheses using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data sets.</br>
