        <br>Title: Motivating Contributions to Online Knowledge Communities: Virtual Rewards and Reputation</br><br>Author: Xiahua(Anny) Wei, Department of Economics, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, Ca, 92093, United States of America, xiwei@ucsd.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Wei Chen</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Online communities are important for external innovations. The success depends on attracting voluntary contributions of members. In this study, we investigate the effects of two motivating mechanisms, virtual rewards and reputation, on community contributions. By analyzing panel data from StackExchange.com, we find that these two mechanisms have positive effects on both the quantity and quality of user contributions. Our results provide important implications for theory and managerial practice.</br>
