        <br>Title: Using Decision Analysis to Regulate Medical Devices</br><br>Author: Telba Irony, telba.irony@fda.hhs.gov</br><br>Coauthor(s): David Chan, Larry Kessler</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: The Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the FDA is investigating the use of quantitative decision analysis in regulating medical devices across the total product life cycle. The idea is to analyze certain situations and determine how much evidence is needed in each case in order to make a decision about a certain medical device product.  In this talk we will describe the ideas being explored and request feedback from the audience on how to streamline our efforts.</br>
