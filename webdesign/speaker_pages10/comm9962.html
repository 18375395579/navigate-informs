        <br>Title: A Quantal Choice Paradox in a Newsvendor Experiment: The Anchoring Bias Effect</br><br>Author: Andrew Davis, Assistant Professor, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States of America, adavis@cornell.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Li Chen</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We conduct a simple newsvendor experiment with a two-point demand distribution and find that many of the typical models used to explain newsvendor decisions, include the quantal choice model, cannot explain our data.  However, we find that a simple behavioral model where decision makers anchor on demand forecasts fits our data well.</br>
