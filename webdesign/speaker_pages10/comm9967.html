        <br>Title: Social Influence and Consumer Behavior: Evidence from an Online Music Community</br><br>Author: Yijen Ho, Ph.D. Student, UC - Irvine, SB 318, UC - Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92617, United States of America, hoy1@uci.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Sanjeev Dewan, Jui Ramaprasad</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We examine social influence in an online music community by exploiting natural experiment data. We find that music consumption decisions are driven by observational learning of popular music choices. However, these effects vanish within a few days of popularity information disclosure. Social network influence is also observed, but it is more through friends' favoring rather than listening behavior. Put together, our results shed light on the impacts of social on consumer behavior on music.</br>
