        <br>Title: Incentives and Competitive Crowds</br><br>Author: Yael Grushka-Cockayne, University of Virginia, 100 Darden Boulevard, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, United States of America, GrushkaY@darden.virginia.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Casey Lichtendahl, Phil Pfeifer</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: When individuals are asked to forecast an uncertain quantity, they often face incentives to be the most accurate. Despite the desire to elicit honest forecasts, such competition induces forecasters to report strategically and non-truthfully. The question we address is how incentive schemes influence the accuracy of the crowd’s forecast. We show that forecasting competitions may be attractive alternatives to prediction markets because they are easy to implement and may be more accurate.</br>
