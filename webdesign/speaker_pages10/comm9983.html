        <br>Title: Combining Probability Distributions: A Hierarchical Model of Experts?Information</br><br>Author: Ilia Tsetlin, Associate Professor of Decision Sciences, INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Avenue, Singapore, 138676, Singapore, ilia.tsetlin@insead.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Robert L. Winkler, Anil Gaba</br><br>Year: 2013</br><br>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to represent information acquisition by experts who see common information and also private information from distributions with different means. The model is investigated under different assumptions about the amount and balance of common versus private information as well as the experts?interpretation of the information. We discuss implications for issues such as combining distributions and overconfidence.</br>
