        <br>Title: Gains from Others' Losses: The Technology Trajectories and the Global Division of Firms</br><br>Author: Chia-Hsuan Yang, Carnegie Mellon University, Dept. EPP, Baker Hall 129, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States of America, chiahsuy@andrew.cmu.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Erica Fuchs, Rebecca Nugent</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: After the burst of the telecom bubble in March 2000, the majority of U.S. optoelectronic component firms moved manufacturing offshore. This research explores (1) whether due to the different offshore production economics, the firms who move manufacturing offshore stop or slow U.S.-based R&D activities in particular technologies and (2) whether inventors originally within these offshoring firms, leave, and continue to innovate in the pre-offshoring technologies at different institutions.</br>
