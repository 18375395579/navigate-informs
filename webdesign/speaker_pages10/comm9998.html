        <br>Title: Adverse SOX Disclosures and Persistent Portfolio Underperformance</br><br>Author: Bruce Weber, Professor of Information Management, London Business School, Regents Park, London, NW1 4SA, United Kingdom, bweber@london.edu</br><br>Year: 2008</br><br>Abstract: Portfolios made up of companies disclosing SOX corporate governance weaknesses in the period 2003-07 underperform the market. Mandatory disclosures began with 2005 10Ks of firms valued $75 million+.  Noncompliant firms performed in line with an equal weighted index before 2005, but underperform after. Firms that fail to remediate and disclose material weaknesses in their 2006 10Ks have annual returns 29% below an index benchmark. Firms that remediate underperform by 22% annually.</br>
