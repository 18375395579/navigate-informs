Title: Supply Chain Contracting with Limited Demand InformationAuthor: Houyuan Jiang, University Senior Lecturer, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom, h.jiang@jbs.cam.ac.ukCoauthor(s): Serguei NetessineYear: 2012Abstract: The well-known buy-back contract in supply chains is investigated when only limited demand information is available to both retailer and supplier. When the demand support is the only available information, we show that the buy-back contract can never coordinate the supply chain except for the degenerate solutions under certain conditions. We explore demand information requirements as well as contract enhancements for coordinating supply chains.
