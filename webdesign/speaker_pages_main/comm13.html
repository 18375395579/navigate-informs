Title: Noncooperative Scheduling Games with AuctionsAuthor: Zhixin Liu, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan-Dearborn, United States, liu.573@osu.eduCoauthor(s): Nicholas G. HallYear: 2007Abstract: We consider models where a group of agents, each with a set of jobs, schedule their jobs on a common processing facility. Each agent wants to minimize an objective function which depends on her own jobs' completion times. Sequencing positions or time slots are allocated to alternative jobs based on the bids of participating agents. We investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of auction mechanisms, and the optimization, closure, effectiveness and equilibrium of agents' bidding policies.
