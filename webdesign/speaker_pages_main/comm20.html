High-Performance analytics exploits massively parallel processing to reduce dramatically the run time needed for the construction of analytical models. A brief overview of various computing approaches is given. This workshop then highlights the similarities and differences between the High-Performance nodes in SAS Enterprise Miner 12.1 and the classical nodes that have been available for same time in previous versions of Enterprise Miner. A software demonstration is included.</br>
