Constraint restriction combines propagation with an arbitrary narrowing of the domains. It can narrow several domains simultaneously, while preserving consistency. We show how to incorporate constraint restriction into a MAC based backtrack search algorithm without compromising the algorithm completeness. We demonstrate several cases where it is useful to apply this technique.</br>
