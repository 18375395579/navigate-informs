There is a gatekeeper and losses incur when a job is turned away at the first station or when the second is full upon service completion at the first. We fully characterize the optimal policy to minimize long run average cost for systems with small to moderate buffers at the 2nd station. We also propose an easily implementable heuristic policy that yields near optimal performance.</br>
