Title: Optimal Admission Control Policies for Two Station Tandem Queues with LossAuthor: Daniel Silva, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30363, United States of America, dfsi3@gatech.eduCoauthor(s): Hayriye Ayhan, Bo ZhangYear: 2012Abstract: We study a system of 2 queues in tandem, the 1st station has a buffer of size one, the 2nd has an arbitrary buffer. There is a gatekeeper and losses incur when a job is turned away at the first station or when the second is full upon service completion at the first. We fully characterize the optimal policy to minimize long run average cost for systems with small to moderate buffers at the 2nd station. We also propose an easily implementable heuristic policy that yields near optimal performance.
