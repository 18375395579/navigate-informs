Title: An Integrated Evaluation Platform for Regional Planning Methods for Freight Transportation SystemsAuthor: Rajeev Namboothiri, Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, CIRRELT, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128, succ.

We develop methodologies to perform an actual multimodal, multi-product freight transportation system simulation. These tools efficiently model the different components of these systems, and their complex interactions. They provide a realistic representation of the current state of the system, and serve as a comprehensive analysis tool for system state changes in the future.
