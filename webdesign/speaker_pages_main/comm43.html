Title: Weather Normalization for Evaluating National Airspace System (NAS) PerformanceAuthor: Jing Xiong, NEXTOR, UC Berkeley, 107E McLaughlin Hall, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, United States, jingxiong@berkeley.eduCoauthor(s): Mark HansenYear: 2007Abstract: The need to benchmark air traffic management performance, predict future performance, and improve our understanding of air traffic operations has created a growing literature on the statistical modeling of delays in the National Airspace System (NAS). We will quantify delays by casual factors such as traffic, weather, and etc.
