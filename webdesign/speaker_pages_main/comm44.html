Title: Network Reliability Lower Bound via Petri NetsAuthor: Jose Ramirez-Marquez, Assistant Professor, Stevens Institute of Technology, Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ, 07030, United States, Jose.Ramirez-Marquez@stevens.eduCoauthor(s): Stuart Van WeeleYear: 2007Abstract: Petri nets have been used for graphically representing information and material flow through a discrete system. In this research, Petri nets have been implemented for modeling classic network reliability problems. Moreover, based on the results obtained, data mining has been used to propose a lower bound for network reliability. This technique allows for the evaluation of reliability without the need to resort to simulation whenever changes in the reliability of network components occur.
