Title: Bayesian Opinion PoolsAuthor: Casey Lichtendahl, Assistant Professor of Business Administration, University of Virginia, Darden School of Business, Charlottesville, VA, 22902, United States, lichtendahlc@darden.virginia.eduCoauthor(s): Robert WinklerYear: 2006Abstract: Opinion pools are popular ways used in practice to combine expert forecasts of a continuous random quantity into a single forecast. We propose several Bayesian opinion pools as directly assigned posteriors of the random quantity given an expert's forecast and compare the implied likelihoods to likelihoods in other Bayesian combination models.
