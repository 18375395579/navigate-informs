Title: Information-Theoretic Learning for Stimulus-specific Clustering with fMRIAuthor: Chun-An (Joe) Chou, University of Washington, 3900 Stevens Way, Seattle, WA, United States of America, joechou@uw.eduCoauthor(s): Kittipat Bot Kampa, Art ChaovalitwongseYear: 2012Abstract: Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a popular approach for cognitive recognition with functional MRI (fMRI), as it is consistent with a neural system that mental operations/representations are instantiated in a neural population code spanning multiple voxels. In this work, we employ an unsupervised clustering with an information-theoretic measure to identify the spatial patterns of voxels in response to stimuli. The results illustrate that there are specific clusters for different stimuli.
