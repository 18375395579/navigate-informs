Universitaria, San Nicolas de los Garza, NL, 66450, Mexico, roger@yalma.fime.uanl.mx</br><br>Coauthor(s): Ana Laura Gonzalez</br><br>Year: 2012</br><br>Abstract: Recently, Church proposed a reformulation and solution procedure for the p-median problem.  Later, Elloumi proposed a different reformulation for the problem suggesting this could be embedded within  an exact optimization method. In this talk we present an algorithm for the p-median problem that relies in the Elloumi's problem reformulation.  The algorithm is compared to the procedure proposed by Church  on a set of benchmark instances.</br>
