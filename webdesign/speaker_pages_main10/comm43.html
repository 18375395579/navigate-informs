After the original booking, the firm offers an upgrade so that the consumer can pay a fee to upgrade the product to a high-quality one if there are leftovers at the end of the booking period. Consumers anticipate the upgrade probability when making booking decisions. We characterize the firm's optimal upgrade price and discuss when and why the conditional upgrade strategy is beneficial to the firm.</br>
