We map data points into a space defined by the class probability estimates from a pool of two-class classifiers. We define the new distance measure to be the Euclidean distance between data points in this space. We dynamically pick classifiers (features) to be used and the k-nearest neighbors of a test point by minimizing the distance between the neighbors and the test point.</br>
