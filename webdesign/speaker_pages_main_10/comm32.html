<br>Title: Hypergraphic Structures for Solving Hard Mixed Integer Programming Instances</br><br>Author: Eva Lee, Associate Professor, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, evakylee@isye.gatech.edu</br><br>Coauthor(s): Siddhartha Maheshwary</br><br>Year: 2006</br><br>Abstract: We continue our report on hypegraphic facial structures and its application in solving hard mixed integer programming instances arising from marketshare, and cancer treatment applications. The talk will first present recent theoretical results, next it will focus on the separation routines and parallel implementation of an efficient branch-and-cut environment. Computational results of real instances will be presented.</br>
