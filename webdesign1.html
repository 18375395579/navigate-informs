2008"This talk presents an evaluation platform dedicated to strategic regional planning of freight transportation systems. We develop methodologies to perform an actual multimodal, multi-product freight transportation system simulation. These tools efficiently model the different components of these systems, and their complex interactions. They provide a realistic representation of the current state of the system, and serve as a comprehensive analysis tool for system state changes in the future."
