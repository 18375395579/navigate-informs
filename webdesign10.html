2013"In the past few years, the number of metagenomic projects in natural (such as soil and water) or host-associated (such as human gut and oral cavity) environments has grown exponentially.  Based on the short reads sequencing data, we propose a mixture model to characterize the taxonomic composition of a metagenomic sample. The method is comprehensively tested on both simulated and real data, and is able to accurately identify and quantify multiple genomes."
