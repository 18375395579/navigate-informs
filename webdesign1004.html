2012"This research addresses the determination of the onset and duration of contraflow operations for hurricane evacuation planning. A modeling framework is developed featuring (1) an underlying traffic flow model to describe traffic dynamics; (2) incident identification and characterization using artificial intelligence; (3) various optimization techniques for decision making under uncertainties; and (4) a computer-based decision support system. A case study of I-65 in Alabama is provided."
