2012"In modern manufacturing scale-up efforts, both experimental and observational data are available for material, process and quality. Current research efforts limited their scope on modeling quality-process relationship based on single type of data. This paper presents an innovative method to model the quality-process relationship by the fusion of the two types of data. An ensemble modeling strategy is developed, and case studies in both simulation and wafer manufacturing are provided."
