2006"Previous Laplace inversions for Asian options are complicated and have some stability problems. In this paper we present a new representation so that Laplace transforms can be obtained easily and inverted in a stable way. Furthermore, the method works in a broader setting include both the classical Brownian model and models with jumps."
