2006"There have been recent advances in benchmarking based on frontier estimation that are underutilized in critical care.  A revised Rapoport-Teres Graph for benchmarking will be presented that is now based on regression models derived from 124,855 patients in the Project IMPACT database from 2001-2004: the Mortality Probability Model (MPM0–III) and a length of stay model.  Frontier efficiency models will then be introduced as alternatives and their benefits and limitations will be discussed."
