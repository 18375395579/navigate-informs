2008"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major public health problem in China.  Newborn vaccination rates have increased significantly in recent years, yet many children still remain unprotected from HBV.  We used a mathematical model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of catch-up vaccination programs for children in China.  We found that catch-up vaccination is cost-effective.  We also examined the drivers for the cost-effectiveness of this program to determine when the intervention could be discontinued."
