2007"This study develops a methodology for the analysis of airlines on-time  performance characteristics.   Gate delays are computed by using Performance  Data Analysis and Reporting System (PDARS) actual arrival times (plus taxi-in times) and the Official Airline Guide (OAG) scheduled gate arrival times.  The proposed model suggests new airport gate policy alternatives as a function of gate delay variations that relate to (i) origin airports, (ii) airline characteristics, (iii) utilized runways and (iv) weather conditions."
