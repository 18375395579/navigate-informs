2013"A comprehensive framework for diver detection by a sensor network in an urban harbor is presented. For each detection period, sensor outputs are aggregated into a linear statistic, whose coefficients and detection threshold are optimized for each noise scenario. On a short time scale, the serial dependence of sensor outputs is modeled by a hidden Markov chain, and optimal sensor placement is formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with respect to different noise scenarios."
