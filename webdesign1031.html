" 1 - Hierarchical State Space Model for Short Microarray Time Course Experiments"
Ming Yuan, myuan@isye.gatech.edu"
2006"Four common tasks in microarray time course experiments are hypothesis testing, pattern recognition, trajectory formation and network/pathway reconstruction. In this work, we propose a hierarchical model integrated with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) structure and auto-regression (AR) to model the temporal gene expression profile on both expression level and state level so that all these tasks can be addressed in a unified framework. We illustrate the method on a vaccacine study."
