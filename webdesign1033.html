2013"In this paper we develop a novel methodology to simultaneously optimize locations  and designs for a set of new facilities facing competition from some pre-existing fa-  cilities. Known as the Competitive Facility Location and Design Problem (CFDLP),  this model was previously only solvable when a limited number of design scenarios was  pre-specied. Our methodology removes this limitation and allows for solving of much  more realistic models. The results are illustrated with a small case study."
