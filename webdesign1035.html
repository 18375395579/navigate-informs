2012"The Global Nuclear Detection Architecture (GNDA) uses a multi-layered, time phased, defense in depth strategy. The architecture uses materials protection, control, and accountability; security of radioactive sources, point of departure screening, at-sea interdiction, border protection, and maritime inspection.  We provide the structure of an integrated modeling framework to use for system architecture trade-off analyses."
