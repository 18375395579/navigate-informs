2013"We study the misspecification bias that arises from using a single DEA-model to evaluate activities that are in fact separable. The bias can be attributed to activity aggregation and input aggregation, respectively. The former effect is non-negative, whereas the latter, known in the literature as intra-input aggregation, is non-positive in the absence of allocative inefficiency. We demonstrate, using simulated data, the total effect of model misspecification on technical and cost efficiency."
