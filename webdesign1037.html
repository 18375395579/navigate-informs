2013"With current technology, environmental variables and usage information can be easily recorded over time. It is important to incorporate those environmental variables into the degradation path. Physical knowledge often suggests nonlinear degradation path. We propose a nonlinear mixed effects model incorporating with dynamic covariates to model the degradation path. Shape-restricted splines are used and an alternating algorithm is proposed. An outdoor weathering dataset is used for illustrations."
