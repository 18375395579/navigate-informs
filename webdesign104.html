2012"In certain manufacturing processes, low resolution categorical observations could be obtained as feasible and low-cost surrogates for accurate readings. In this work, a new online approach for parameter estimation and run-to-run process control using categorical observations is developed. The new approach is built in the Bayesian framework; it provides a convenient way to update parameter estimates when categorical observations arrive gradually in a real production scenario."
