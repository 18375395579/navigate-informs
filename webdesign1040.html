2008"Existing day-to-day traffic equilibration processes assume that travelers?behavior adjustments are based on their experiences. This assumption fails when the network is unexpectedly disrupted. We assume travelers?choices are based on their projected traffic states. Perception change is formulated as an individual dynamical system. The proposed framework offers a good estimation of traffic equilibration process, demonstrated by traffic pattern evolution after the I-35W bridge collapse."
