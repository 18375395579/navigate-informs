2008"One of the most critical challenges in national security is the detection of a nuclear or radiological weapon in the midst of common radioactive materials.  We are developing a unique approach that combines inputs from multiple radiation sensors with contextual information (e.g., location, manifest information, etc.). We use physics-based techniques to reduce the measurements and contextual information into a series of feature vectors, and machine learning algorithms to classify the incident."
