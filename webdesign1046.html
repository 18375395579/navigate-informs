2012"Modeling joint production of multiple outputs under stochastic noise remains an important challenge in productive efficiency analysis. This paper extends the axiomatic semi-nonparametric StoNED approach to the general multi-input multi-output setting. Our theoretical model contains both the parametric distance functions and the nonparametric DEA as its special cases. Assuming radial inefficiency and noise, consistent estimators of the input and output distance functions are developed."
