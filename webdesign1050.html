2013"We propose a mathematical model to derive OSPF routing policies in the presence of router active queue management.  We discuss the computational complexity of the proposed general model.  A modified model is proposed to ensure edge weights are realizable and feasible.  We conclude by showing the derived routing policies tend to perform better than those used in a real world network."
