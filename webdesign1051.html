2012"We analyze a novel switching-station based business model for the deployment of electric vehicles. The firm charges customers for the miles driven and establishes a network of battery swapping stations to enable rapid change of batteries.  We compare this new service model to the traditional EV sales model in terms of market adoption and environmental impact. We also investigate how the advances in battery technology influence the adoption and environmental impact of the new model."
