2013"Advances in nanotechnology have enhanced the performance of sensors. In this talk we focus on the reliability of a Palladium nanowire network based hydrogen sensor. We use a square lattice to model the structure and assume the sensor is operating in an environment where the probability of a wire breaking changes after hydrogen exposure. We also consider the case where the probability does not change. The results are applicable to any nanodevice where the proposed model is a reasonable choice."
