2008"Using the sample average approximation method for solving a stochastic LP results in a biased estimate of the optimal objective value.  In this research, we investigate the use of bootstrapping to reduce this bias.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of using bootstrapping to reduce this bias on a set of test problems."
