2013"We use Logical Analysis of Data, a sophisticated and robust classification method based on the theory of Boolean functions, optimization, and combinatorics, to analyze the clinical and proteomics chronic kidney disease (CKD) data collected as part of the African American Study of Kidney Disease & Hypertension. The goal of our study is to identify combinatorial biomarkers (combination of highly influential clinical and serum proteomic features) that accurately predict the progression of CKD."
