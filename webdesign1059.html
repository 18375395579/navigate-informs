2008"We integrated demand scheduling and destination choice to synergize their potential benefits to emergency evacuation.The result is an optimal spatio-temporal evacuation (OSTE) model and tool that helps evacuees to decide where to go, when to go, and how to get there. A case study applying the model to a portion of Downtown Toronto in a simulated environment is also presented. The model results and findings are discussed."
