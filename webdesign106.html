2013"The availability of sensor technology has facilitated the capability of monitoring systems degradation. In this research, we develop a multi-sensor prognostic methodology to dynamically estimate residual lifetime (RL) of partially degraded systems. First, a regularized functional regression model is developed to identify sensors whose signals are correlated with degradation processes. These signals are then fused via multi-dimensional functional PCA that is used to predict the RL of a system."
