2013"We use video data collected at retail stores to assess the value of sale employees in engaging customers. We develop several econometric models that use different types of video data, which differ in the frequency of samples collected and the amount of information of the customer's shopping experience. We use these models to quantify the economic value provided by sales employees and thereby support staffing decisions."
