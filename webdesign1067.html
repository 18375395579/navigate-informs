2006"This study develops a sampling methodology to comprehensively evaluate over 9000 unstaffed facilities of the National Airspace System infrastructure assets. Because the FAA has near accurate information for some of the facilities with very high repair costs, we define a sampling methodology for the rest of the facilities based on such incomplete data. We approach the problem as an exercise in stratified sampling, with each strata representing certain set of facility over a region."
