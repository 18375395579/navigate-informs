2007"The total aggregate delay experienced by aircraft in the United States is a measure of performance of the air traffic management system. Weather is a major factor causing delay. This paper describes a classification methodology and a three-step regression model to provide a comprehensive approach to estimate delay. The methodology is verified using national traffic, weather and delay data for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006."
