2007"Computerized clinical reminders (CCRs) are useful tools for alerting healthcare providers of upcoming or overdue events. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of CCRs users from 104 different VA facilities using a 5-point Likert scale. The survey data were analyzed using a cross-validated regression tree algorithm to measure the factors affecting clinician’s perceived usefulness of CCRs."
