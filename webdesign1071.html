2013"We present a system dynamics mathematical model and multi-agent-based model (MABM), which model and simulate the innate immunity and adaptive immunity of sepsis, especially getting insights into the time and intensity of intervention of anti-inflammatory cytokines in sepsis evolution. By comparing the results from both models, we conclude that MABM is more realistic approach to simulate sepsis progression."
