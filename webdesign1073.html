2012"LAMM is capable of generating three dimensional microscale features in hard metals. An engineering-driven force model that captures the effect of thermal softening due to laser heating has been developed. We proposed a systematic way to estimate unknown model parameters with experimental force measurements. This model provides accurate force predictions over a range of production conditions in a timely manner which facilitates the LAMM process optimization to yield the maximal force reduction."
