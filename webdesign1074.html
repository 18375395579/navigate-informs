2006"We develop common performance assessment measures and analyze correlation levels for a portfolio of National Airspace System modernization technologies. We then propose a portfolio optimization model to determine the optimal allocation of available resources to the technologies in consideration. In addition, the computational difficulty of the proposed model is analyzed, and appropriate solution methods are described."
