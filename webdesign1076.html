2006"Statistical models often inform the analysis of networks of scientific interest (Fienberg et al. 1985; Wasserman & Pattison 1996; Watts & Strogatz 1998; Kossinets & Watts 2006). We introduce a hierarchical model of "network evolution" that combines mixed membership (Airoldi et al. 2006) and a latent space (Hoff et al. 2002) for learning dynamic connectivity patterns among nodes. We develop a fast, approximate posterior inference algorithm, and analyze Enron's email communication network."
