2006"This paper reports on the findings and lessons learned from a hardware and human-in-the-loop experiment conducted in May 2006 for the Joint Staff. The experiment linked a network simulation called QualNet with a human-in-the-loop version of the agent based tool Map Aware Non-Uniform Automata. Several areas will be investigated, such as the choice of models, design of experiments, analysis of similar efforts, as well as the technical challenges encountered in modifying the model for HITL use."
