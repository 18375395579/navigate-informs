2006"There are often competing multiple objectives when planning military resource allocation. Many times, the measures of effectiveness (MOE) and tradeoffs used in the optimization objective function are ill-defined or non-existent. We discuss applications where decision analysis has been used to help prioritize the MOE’s and define weights for the objective function."
