2008"In this paper we analyze risks from information deficiencies in credit application and ensuing financial implications. We first employ the use of record matching software and design optimal configuration to minimize financial costs. Next we explore the option of procuring additional information to improve accuracy of record matches. We develop models to decide conditions under which it is optimal to exercise the option of information procurement."
