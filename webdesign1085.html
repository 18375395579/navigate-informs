2007"In this talk, we present discrete-time traffic assignment models for managed lanes such as HOV and HOT lanes.  Unlike discrete-time models for general networks, our models have a simple network structure and their upper bounds can be obtained by solving mixed-integer optimization problems using, e.g., Benders decomposition.  Also, numerical results will be presented."
