2012"Despite their economic significance as the primary sources of electricity, synchronous generators have not benefited from sensory-based prognostics. The difficulty arises due to the large number of subcomponents and the complexities in their corresponding failure processes. This work uses physics of failure models to provide a closed-form expression for the remaining life distribution of synchronous generators. Degradation is modeled as a competing risks type stochastic process."
