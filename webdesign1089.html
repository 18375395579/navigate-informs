2006"The paper uses state-space specifications of time series and develops dynamic, stochastic, multivariate infrastructure performance models that capture the effectiveness of maintenance activities, exogenous factors and uncertainty. A fully and a partially aggregated specifications are proposed. Their predictive power and poolability of data are evaluated by a benchmark model."
