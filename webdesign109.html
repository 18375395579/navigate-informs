2007"Building multiattribute value functions requires translating the preferences of a Decision Maker into precise numbers, which is often problematical even in the additive case. Hence, procedures such as SMART and Even Swaps have been proposed. We discuss elicitation of information which, albeit not precise, may facilitate the cognitive burden on the analysis. The incomplete information can then be used to provide guidance on the best choice using tools like simulation or mathematical programming."
