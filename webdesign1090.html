2012"Social Network Analysis?techniques can be investigated through Design of Experiments (DOE).  Analysis of network models using DOE is sometimes accomplished through traditional ordinary least squares regression, which may result in non-normality of residuals of fitted models.  A full factorial design augmented with a nearly orthogonal Latin hypercube of a SNA technique is examined via a linear model constructed using quantile regression to mitigate the non-normality of the error terms."
