2008"Optimization problems with underlying expensive black-box evaluations are arising in various applications, e.g. when results from computational expensive simulations, or even laboratory experiments are needed to evaluate the objective function and the constraints. We will discuss how surrogates can be used for the arising problems, even when beside of the resulting noisy function output and the absense of gradients furthermore integer-valued variables are included beside of continuous ones."
