2012"In this paper we examine the interactions between the parameters of virus epidemiology, social behavior, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This examination is conducted using an agent-based simulation model and designed statistical experiments. Results are used to design effective NPI strategies for pandemic influenza mitigation. Some numerical results are presented for various virus transmissibility scenarios."
