2007"We present models employing alternative objectives for integrated topology control and routing in wireless sensor networks. The models attempt to promote energy efficiency with the purpose of prolonging network lifetime. We develop efficient heuristics reinforced with exact methods and cut generations. We provide computational results  demonstrating that employing combined objectives based on energy usage and remaining energy characteristics helps to significantly extend the network lifetime."
