2008"We describe an integrated decision-making framework and model for supporting the unification of the fragmented European air traffic management systems, developed to aid Eurocontrol in its vital role in the construction of a Single European Sky. Combining multi-criteria decision analysis with large-scale optimization, our model facilitates the process by which the numerous European aviation stakeholders evaluate and select technological enhancements. We take into account multiple objectives and potential disagreements and differing priorities among stakeholders."
