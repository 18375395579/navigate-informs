2013"Focusing on nonlinear relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty which has been discussed in the literature, we propose non-linear modeling of customer satisfaction index(CSI).  We empirically show that nonlinear model is better than linear model, and non-linear patterns are different across industries according to the competitive environment in a market and consumer's degree of involvement."
