2013"Since its introduction by Kaplan and Norton in 1992 the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has started a remarkable triumphal march. It is surprising that most often the process of creating BSCs is methodological poorly exercised and established techniques of decision analysis are not considered. We introduce a systematic, consistent and efficient approach of creating a BSC using Value-focused Thinking. In a case study, we illustrate the procedure and create a highly individualized media-specific BSC."
