" 1 - Sensible Validation for IW Simulations"
Michael Bailey, USMC, 3300 Russell Road, Quantico, VA, United States of America, michael.bailey@usmc.mil"
2008"The USMC has led an effort to tailor the concept of simulation validation to analytical applications used to explore irregular warfare issues.  This effort has produced a set of guidelines that require actions from model developers and from analysts.  We provide a vernacular and a structured framework for exposing the adequacy of a simulation to support a typical irregular warfare analysis task, and give guidance concerning the assessment of positive and negative validation results."
