2012"Recently GAMS made a first cut at supporting stochastic programming. With a few changes uncertainty can be added to an existing deterministic model. For this, the Extended Mathematical Programming (EMP) framework is used to replace parameters in the model by random variables. This way multi-stage recourse problems and chance constraint models can be formulated."
