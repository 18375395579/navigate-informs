2012"We extend Newell's car-following model to incorporate time-dependent parameters, and use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm for model calibration. By synthesizing NGSIM driver trajectory data, we will examine driver heterogeneity in car-following behavior, as well as the driver's heterogeneous situation-dependent behavior within a trip."
