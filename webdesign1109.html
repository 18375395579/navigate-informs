2006"We propose a tree-based data masking method for protecting privacy against record linkage attacks. The method recursively splits a dataset into smaller subsets such that data records within each subset are more homogeneous after each partition. The partition is made at the maximum variance dimension represented by the first principal component of the data at each partition. The confidential attribute values of a record in a subset are then masked using a rank-based swapping method."
