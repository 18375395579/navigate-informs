2006"Standardly, bids by distinct firms in the day-ahead market for electricity are combined to produce a kinked supply curve.  We report results from an agent-based model in which a stochastic demand curve for electricity is given exogenously and in which two agents learn to bid to supply electricity. We report on the design of the model, the behavior of various learning regimes, and the conditions under which tacit collusion by the bidding agents may be arrived at, sustained, and destroyed."
