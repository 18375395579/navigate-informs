2007"The changes in banking regulations in 2007 mean credit scoring models need to be extended to help build credit risk models of portfolios of consumer loans. In particular there is a need to include the impact of macro economic conditions on the default risks of borrowers, which would allow stress testing of the models. This paper outlines one approach to this problem based on survival analysis ideas. It is applied  to the data from four years performance of over 50,000 loans."
