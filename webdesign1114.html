2013"Julia, a new high-level programming language for scientific computing, claims to bridge the performance gap between languages such as Python and MATLAB and low-level languages such as C and C++. We will evaluate these claims in the context of algorithms and software fundamental to the field of operations research, including the simplex method and algebraic modeling. We provide extensive cross-language benchmarks and comparisons with state-of-the-art modeling packages such as AMPL and Pyomo."
