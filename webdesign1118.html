2006"The Anisotropic mesoscopic Simulation (AMS) model is a mesoscopic traffic simulation approach that is based on directional influence of car-following mechanism.  This talk gives an overview of the model with the focus on the calibration and validation procedure and results of the AMS model using the NGSIM data."
