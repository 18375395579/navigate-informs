2007"It is common to model terminal airspace as a queuing system in order to determine performance metrics such as delay.  The input data for such models, when taken from the most common databases, are confounded with a large variety of other influences, and model performance typically suffers as a result.  We show some techniques for filtering and remediating these influences, and the subsequent performance gains that can be expected."
