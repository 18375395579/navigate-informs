2013"This talk focuses on the monitoring of incomplete dynamic profiles with time-varying mean, variation and length. Taking the ingot growing process as an example, we propose to use dynamic-time-warping (DTW) to align profiles having different lengths first, and then compare online but incomplete profiles with a baseline profile for faults detection. Both numerical simulations and real examples are demonstrated for performance comparison."
