2007"Traditional inventory management assumes the precise knowledge of the underlying demand distribution and a risk-neutral manager. New product introduction does not fit this framework because (i) not enough information is available to compute probabilities and (ii) managers are generally risk-averse. In this work, we investigate the impact of information when the optimal cost is computed using a robust, distribution-free approach. We derive optimality conditions and present simulation experiments."
