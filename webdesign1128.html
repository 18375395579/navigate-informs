2012"In prior work we highlighted problems with conventional Top-N news recommenders and presented a probabilistic alternative. Here we introduce a new class of recommendation techniques with feedback and discuss various properties of it both analytically and through simulations. Urn models from probability theory have been used to discuss the various properties of the proposed recommendation mechanism in a special case."
