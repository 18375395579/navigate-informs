2008"An important component of virtually any model of emergency service operations (an analytic model or optimization model) is the travel time of vehicles, especially of those en route to a call. In this paper, we present a semi-parametric statistical model for estimating travel times for emergency services using unique data from ambulance operations of the city of Calgary, Canada."
