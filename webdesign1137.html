2006"Kriging is a useful method for developing meta-models for product design optimization. However, the commonly used kriging predictor has some problems; it is not easy to interpret, not robust to the misspecifications in the correlation parameters, and in some cases may lead to poor predictions. In this article, we propose a modified kriging method that overcomes the foregoing problems. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated with several examples."
