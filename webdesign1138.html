2013"In manufacturing scale-up, both quantitative and qualitative responses are often used to measure the quality of products. In this work, we propose a novel method of jointly modeling quantitative and qualitative responses. The constraint likelihood approach is used to incorporate the inherent features of data and accommodate the association between two types of responses. The merits of the proposed method are illustrated by simulations and a real case study in semiconductor manufacturing."
