2013"We model callers' decision making process in call centers as an optimal stopping problem. The utility of a caller is modeled as a function of her waiting cost and reward for service that are estimated from the data of calls made to a call center. Our analysis reveals that modeling endogenous caller behavior can be important when major changes (such as a change in service discipline) are performed, and that using a model with an exogenously specified abandonment distribution may be misleading."
