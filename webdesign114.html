2013"In this talk, we show the equivalence of two fluid models for G_t/GI/N+GI queues, the two-parameter fluid model by Whitt (2006) and the measure-valued fluid model by Kang and Ranaman (2010).  We also explore connections between fluid models tracking residual times and fluid models tracking elapsed times."
