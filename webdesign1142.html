2008"Following up on the work of Megiddo and Vazirani \cite{MV.2007}, who  determined continuity properties of equilibrium prices and  allocations for perhaps the simplest market model, Fisher's linear  case, we do the same for:    1. Fisher's model with piecewise-linear, concave utilities    2. Fisher's model with spending constraint utilities    3. Arrow-Debreu's model with linear utilities    4. Arrow-Debreu's model with piecewise-linear, concave utilities."
