2007"This paper presents a noble formalism of human-involved automated systems using finite state automata, which incorporates the ecological concept of affordances. The system complexity of human involved manufacturing systems can be tremendously increased when the human acts as one of system components. Humans have limitations, which come from system affordances. We investigate these limitations and map them to the system affordances, in order to analyze and control  via simulation."
