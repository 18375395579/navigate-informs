2008"We propose a combination of optimization and simulation models to improve decision making in yard operations of a distribution center (DC). The optimization model decides truck - dock assignments considering the shipment deadlines, late penalties, loading times etc. Loading times depend on the operations inside the DC modeled by a real time simulation. The models are applied in a large DC in South America and improvements are discussed."
