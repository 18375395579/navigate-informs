2012"We employed Dirichlet process based Gaussian mixture models to handle the matrix inversion and stationary covariance assumption issues in Gaussian processes, and investigated it for complex system multiple-step forecasting. The application in atomistic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of carbon nanotube synthesis process indicates that this forecasting approach can save over 80% of the MC simulation computational expense."
