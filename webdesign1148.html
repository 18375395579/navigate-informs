2008"CODELCO, the largest mining firm in Chile, has developed large scale models to support detailed planning of mine extraction.  For purposes of corporate planning or when incorporating uncertainty, aggregate planning is adequate. We use cluster analysis and both a priori (on raw data) and a posteriori (on the detailed LP formulation) aggregation. Computational results show significant reductions in problem size and CPU run time, while guaranteeing a moderate bound on the error due to aggregation."
