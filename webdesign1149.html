2013"In the framework of active portfolio management, we propose a model based on generalized hyperbolic distributions to incorporate the relative confidence given to the consensus excess returns and the forecasted ones. This methodology provides a simple and intuitive way to incorporate distribution uncertainty, and to find closed-form expressions for the optimal portfolio weights."
