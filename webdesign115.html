2008"Frontier outliers attain upper or lower limits of the magnitudes not just in one dimension but also when these are combined. They are naturally interesting since they may expose risk, profit, fraud, or security. Their identification is a challenge especially when no weights are designated for combining the attributes and when the data set is massive. We present a framework for defining and processing frontier outliers in general magnitude data sets."
