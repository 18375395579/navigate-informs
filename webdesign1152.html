2008"We incorporate short sales and derivatives to our recently developed log-robust optimization model, where the uncertainty is on the continuously compounded rates of return - in line with the traditional Lognormal model - but probability distributions are not known. We develop heuristics and present insights into the structure of the optimal policy as well as numerical results."
