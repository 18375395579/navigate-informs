2012"A proper Phase I analysis is essential to the success of Phase II monitoring. This research develops a Phase I location control chart for multivariate processes.  The resulting in-control reference sample can then be used to estimate the parameters for Phase II monitoring.  The proposed method is compared to the Hotelling's T2 Phase I chart.  The proposed method is shown to perform significantly better under non-normality."
