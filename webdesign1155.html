2012"In this talk, we present an overview of Bayesian Reliability Growth Modelling. Further, we  develop a new model  for Bayesian Reliability Growth Modeling which can account for various a priori growth patterns. The posterior distributions for all quantities of interest must be obtained via MCMC methods. We illustrate our methodology with real and simulated data."
