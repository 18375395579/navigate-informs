2012"Health condition prediction is a key part for condition based maintenance (CBM). It is observed that the prediction accuracy improves with the increase of the age of the component as it approaches the failure time in many applications. In this paper, we model the relationship between the prediction accuracy and the age of a component relative to its predicted failure time. A numerical method is presented to evaluate the cost of the CBM policy."
