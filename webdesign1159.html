2012"Patient movement within a constrained health care delivery system is a dynamic and stochastic process that often defies analysis through standard analytical and predictive tools. Therefore, to adequately understand and optimize the management of ICUs, simulation modeling approaches may be taken. In this work we apply metamodeling tools to evaluate a simulation model over a range of values of parameters pertaining to available resources, clinical rules and patient Length of Stay."
