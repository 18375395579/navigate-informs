" 4 - Robust Sensitivity Analysis for Stochastic Systems"

2012"We propose a parameter-free sensitivity analysis framework for stochastic systems, by using Kullback-Liebler divergence as a measure of distributional discrepancy to compute well-defined derivative estimators. These estimators are robust in that they automatically choose the worst-case directions to move along in the (typically infinite-dimensional) model space. The main methodology is a characterization of the involved optimal changes of measure as solutions to functional fixed point equations."
