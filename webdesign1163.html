2007"This talk concerns the facility layout problem, which is an extremely difficult optimization problem.  We discuss two recent modeling efforts, a top-down approach to facility layout and the sequence-pair representation, and combine them into a new model.  Unfortunately, the saga continues in that the new model is still an extremely difficult optimization problem.  However, we are able to provide evidence of why the top-down model, rather than the traditional, bottom-up model, is the one to use."
