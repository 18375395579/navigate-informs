2008"This research proposes an online Bayesian framework for parameter estimation when only categorical observations are available for Run-to-Run process adjustment. Low-resolution observations are assumed to become available at the end of each run; the proposed method works in a recursive manner to incorporate new information for parameter estimation. Simulations results are also presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme."
