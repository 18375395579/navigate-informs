2008"STRONG  is a newly developed DOE-based simulation optimization framework. It has nice convergence guarantee and does not require human intervention in the process. We will present a general version of STRONG which relaxes the normal assumption of the responses (compared to the traditional response surface methodology) to any general distribution with bounded second moment."
