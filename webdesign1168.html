2012"A k-club is an induced subgraph of diameter at most k which is a distance-based graph-theoretic generalization of a clique. The k-clubs can be used to model clusters in social networks, biological networks and internet graphs. This talk will outline the research challenges associated with k-club model because of its non-hereditary nature. New complexity results, theoretical results concerning the 2-club polytope and preliminary numerical results will be presented."
