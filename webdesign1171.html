2007"I will continue our introduction to systems biology and focus on our method for network inference, which learns regulatory influences for genes and/or gene clusters from mRNA and protein expression levels. The procedure can simultaneously model equilibrium and time-course expression levels, such that both kinetic and equilibrium expression levels may be predicted by the resulting models. We discuss the results from an initial application of this method to the extremeophile, Halobacterium NRC-1."
