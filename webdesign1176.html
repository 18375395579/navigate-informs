2012"We discuss GDXRRW (GDX-R Read/Write), a tool for moving data between GAMS and R.  This data exchange benefits both user communities.  It gives R users the capability to use the superior modeling  and optimization capabilities of GAMS, and it allows for visualization  and analysis of GAMS data directly within R to take advantage of R's  wide range of functionality.  The freely available tool is based on  GDX (GAMS Data eXchange), a well-established and public API for  sharing data."
