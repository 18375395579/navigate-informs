2013"We study the problem of jointly locating sidewalks and bus shelters in order to maximize both mobility and safety for walk-and-ride transit users. Our models, which include both hub location and network design decisions,  investigate two objectives: travel time and safety. We employ Benders's decomposition and branch-and-price strategies along with a fast heuristic. A set of computational experiments, using data from Starkville, MS, investigate the robustness and tractability of the models."
