2008"We use heavy-traffic limits and computer simulation to study the performance of alternative real-time delay estimators in overloaded multi-server queuing models, allowing customer abandonment. These delay estimates may be used to make delay announcements in call centers. We exploit established approximations for performance measures with a non-exponential abandonment-time distribution to obtain delay estimates that effectively cope with non-exponential abandonment-time distributions."
