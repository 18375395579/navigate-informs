2007"A fuzzy control framework is used to enhance, based on real-time data measurements, the consistency of a controller-estimated driver behavior model which is a key component in the determination of information-based traffic routing strategies. Enhancing the consistency of the controller-estimated driver behavior model results in more consistent/reliable information-based traffic routing strategies."
