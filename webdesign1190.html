2006"We describe a goal programming based planning system to generate IMRT treatment plans that are robust against patient movement during treatment. The medial line core of an object is used to capture morphological information of each target and OAR. The weight of each voxel is calculated using its distance from the core and is employed into the dose-volume objective functions to steer the local dose distribution. We show the clinical benefits of this planning system dealing with difficult cases."
