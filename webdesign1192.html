2006"Regression and linear programming are two popular techniques for estimating efficiency.  A purported disadvantage of the regression based models is the inability to allow multiple outputs without additional data on input prices.  In this paper, a multiple output regression model is developed.  Notably, technical efficiency can be estimated using Corrected OLS in multiple-input, multiple-output environments without input price data."
