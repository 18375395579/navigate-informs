2008"We study multiproduct dynamic pricing problems with time-dependent customer arrival rates in the retail industry using the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. An integral transformation is employed to translate the time-dependent customer arrival rate model to the well-studied time-homogeneous one. A computational optimal control algorithm is proposed to produce the real-time optimal pricing, which is only based on the total customer arrivals without knowing the actual distribution of arrival rates."
