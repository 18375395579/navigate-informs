2012"Recently, we proposed a robust optimization formulation that unifies several machine learning classification models. In this talk, we show that our model, the robust classification model (RCM), is extendable to other learning methods such as regression, novelty detection, etc. The RCM can be regarded as financial risk measure minimization. Based on such interpretation, we show that some RCM has guaranteed generalization performance."
