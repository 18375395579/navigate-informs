2006"We develop a goal driven stochastic optimization model that takes into account an aspiration level or target. Our model maximizes the shortfall aspiration level criterion, which encompasses the probability of success in achieving the goal and an expected level of under-performance or shortfall. The key advantage of the proposed model is its tractability. We propose a decision rule based deterministic approximation in the form of second order cone optimization problems."
