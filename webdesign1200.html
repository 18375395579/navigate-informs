2007"In fitting linear models often interaction and polynomial terms of the original predictors are used. This can substantially increase the total number of predictors and can cause problems with frequentist estimation. A Bayesian approach can overcome these. Because the predictors are related, specifying a prior for the parameters in the linear model is not easy. In this work, we propose a simple approach to prior specification. The advantage of the approach is illustrated with real examples."
