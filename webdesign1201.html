2006"A formulary is a list of drugs that will be reimbursed by an insurer. In Canada, the public drug plans in each province require drug manufacturers to submit an economic analysis as part of the formulary submission process. In this talk we discuss the use of cost effectiveness analysis, decision trees, Markov models and other decision analytic techniques that are commonly used by drug manufacturers to produce the required economic analyses."
