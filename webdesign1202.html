2006"We introduce an adaptive control variate scheme for estimating steady-state performance measures for stochastic systems using simulation. We use a procedure based on sample average approximation for tuning the control variate estimators. The underlying processes are assumed to be regenerative which allows establishing consistency of these estimators in an efficient way under mild conditions."
