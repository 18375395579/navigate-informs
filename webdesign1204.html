2013"There are two kinds of bidders in sponsored search: those who keep their bids static and those who actively manage their bids.  We develop a model of bidder behavior in sponsored search that applies to both types. All advertisers see substantial variation in rank, which motivates a discrete choice approach that bypasses bids and directly models an advertiser's choice of rank. An empirical evaluation confirms that our model performs well in terms of predicting realized ranks and clicks."
