2012"Stochastic kriging is a metamodeling technique for effectively representing the mean response surface implied by a stochastic simulation. We show that incorporating gradient estimates into stochastic kriging tends to significantly improve surface prediction. We also evaluate the properties of infinitesimal perturbation analysis and likelihood ratio gradient estimators when incorporated into stochastic kriging."
