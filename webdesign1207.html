2007"In the aftermath of a natural disaster, urban planners need to decide how neighborhoods should be restored with limited resources.  Inspired by the events of Hurricane Katrina, we develop a multiobjective optimization model for urban redevelopment that minimizes the future risk of flood and maximize net social benefit under spatial and equity constraints.  Computational results, using data from New Orleans, are encouraging both for model outputs and solution efficiency."
