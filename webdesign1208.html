2008"Risk-based models are in full bloom at FDA, particularly to inform decisions to direct field activities for inspections and imports.  Now that the models are developed, an evaluation strategy will be developed to ensure the models are on a continuous improvement path.  This talk will describe research being conducted into linking public health outcomes to FDA activities as a means for validating and improving these risk based models."
