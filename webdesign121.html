2013"Two different approaches are taken to quantify the impact of the three New York airports on delay throughout the NAS. First we apply an econometric model using a large historical dataset. The other model is the FAA SWAC model that simulates flights and tracks the daily system performance. The counterfactual scenarios in these two models are adjusted to be comparable. Both results conclude that the portion of delay in the system caused by New York airports is much less than publicized estimates."
