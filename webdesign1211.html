2013"Excel's widespread use makes it an ideal tool for teaching and delivering optimization models. However, serious modellers often prefer to use modelling languages such as AMPL, GAMS, PuLP or COOPR/Pyomo. SolverStudio integrates these two worlds by allowing optimization models to be easily developed and solved in Excel. Available free from http://solverstudio.org, SolverStudio also includes support for Python-based Gurobi models, the SimPy simulation environment, and cloud-based solving via NEOS."
