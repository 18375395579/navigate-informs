2013"When we use simulation to evaluate the performance of a stochastic system, the input models are often estimated from real-world data. We derive a confidence interval that accounts for both simulation and input-model uncertainty by using a metamodel-assisted bootstrapping approach. Our approach is rigorously supported with both theoretical analysis and an empirical study."
