2012"Mathematical models facilitate the characterization and recognition of underlying biological patterns. However, there are practical issues pertinent to model efficacy, robustness, and generality. This paper presents a multiscale adaptive basis function approach to model space-time cardiac pathological behaviors, using the "best matching" projections of characteristic waves onto a dictionary of nonlinear basis functions. The model performance is experimentally evaluated with real-world signals."
