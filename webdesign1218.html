2012"Spatial Multicriteria Evaluations are rapidly gaining traction for planning and policy-making as useful tools to make decision processes effective and reliable.  The contribution proposes a Spatial Multicriteria approach based on the integration of Geographic Information Systems and the Analytic Network Process for the development of a land suitability analysis in the context of undesirable facilities location problems. The integrated approach is able to cope with complex decision problems."
