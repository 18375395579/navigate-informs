2008"This model is based upon a Homeland Sercurity's System Modeling Infrastructure Resiliency created by Driscoll and Goerger. The small example considers 6 variables (3 in each layer) while the big model consdier 30 variables (15 in each layer). We hit the dynamical system with a shock effect and analyze the effect on the Iraqi system."
