2012"By integrating network analysis with text sentiment mining techniques, we propose product comparison networks as a novel construct, computed from consumer product reviews. To test the validity of the therefrom derived product ranking measures, we conduct an empirical study based on a digital camera dataset from Amazon.com. The results demonstrate significant effect of network-based measures on product sales."
