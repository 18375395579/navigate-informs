2008"This paper aims at presenting a model of supply chain activities in healthcare within the context of eBusiness and its four behavioral components: information distribution and search, transactions, collaboration and decision-making. The supply chain model of eBusiness in healthcare integrates a process, a document, and a functional model that are all geared to the combined view of clinical and economic issues related to the procurement, provision, and use of medical supplies."
