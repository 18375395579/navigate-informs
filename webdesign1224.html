2012"This work extends existing heuristics to accommodate the additional complexity of emissions, time windows, and fleet heterogeneity on solutions to the Vehicle Routing Problem.  The model is tested and refined using real-world case studies to evaluate the influence of the differing constraints on the solutions. Each case study is unique with differing vehicle heterogeneity, network connectedness, and load characteristics."
