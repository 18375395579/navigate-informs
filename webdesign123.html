2012"Reserve requirements are used to ensure reliability in electric power systems since endogenously modeling all N-1 contingencies is too computationally burdensome. Reserve zones ensure that reserves are dispersed across the network in order to ensure deliverability. This research develops a mathematical program to determine zone partitions for day-ahead unit commitment models while considering the impact on market economics and reliability. Results based on IEEE test cases will be presented."
