2013"Directed acyclic graphic model has been suggested to model the interactions among random variables where directed edges represent the causal influence of components of the system. This presentation discusses the estimation of the structure of the directed acyclic graph by the L1-penalized likelihood approach. We formulate the problem by a linear structure with latent variables under the assumption that the variances of latent variables are unequal and unknown, and a natural ordering is unknown."
