Thomas Rutherford, 4829 Northgate Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48103, United States, tom@mpsge.org"
2006"Alan Manne was a pioneer in the adaptation of energy-economy models to climate policy issues. The talk will highlight aspects of these models which were pathbreaking and remain state of the art: putty-clay technology, stochastic equilibria, integrated treatments of climate and economic systems, and the solution of large-scale equilibrium models with tax distortions and public goods solved by use of iterative optimization."
