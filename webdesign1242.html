2012"A university operates an aging fleet of shuttle vehicles that facilitate travel by its affiliates to, from and around campus.  This paper presents an animated discrete-event simulation model that can be used by campus planners to make capital planning decisions about the fleet.  Experiments were run to identify the best type of shuttle to replace existing vehicles and to quantify how different fleet configurations might accommodate various future increases in ridership."
