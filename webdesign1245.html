2006"Tamoxifen and Aromatase Inhibitors(AIs) are the endocrine therapy agents used  for breast cancer. Although the trial data comparing AIs with tamoxifen show superior efficacy of AIs, the optimal treatment plan is not known yet. Given the patient information, our aim is to design an effective treatment plan, which minimizes risk of recurrence, increases survival chances and keeps side effects within some tolerable limits, by using regression analysis and several mathematical models."
