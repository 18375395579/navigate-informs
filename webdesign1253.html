2012"We propose a novel information-theoretic feature selection method using discrete k-median (DKM) clustering, where the center for each cluster is represented as a set of samples. Normalized mutual information (NMI) scores between the output of DKM and the clusters formed by the projection of center samples are used for feature selection. Average of NMI scores are used for determining the number of clusters. We present results on simluated data and real-life neural time series data."
