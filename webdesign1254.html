2007"We discuss frameworks that use ideas from MIP heuristics such as local branching and RINS to search for feasible solutions simultaneously on many different processors on a grid or high performance computing architecture. Our frameworks are designed to ensure that the work done on different processors does not significantly overlap. Computational evidence suggests that such frameworks can obtain good solutions for many problems faster than commercial solvers."
