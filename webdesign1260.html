2008"We address the problem of assessing cross category associations from market basket data using Bayesian Networks. Specifically, we study how associations across categories vary based on marketing mix activities and demographics. The data set we employ is an IRI market basket data set that contains transactions including 22 categories over 2 years for 500 panelists. Bayesian Networks are learned from this data and are used to identify the underlying dependencies across product categories."
