2008"Current city evacuation plans are highly centralized and require complex coordination of multiple government agencies for implementation.  In research, conventional models used today to strategize for an evacuation are often heavily dependent on behavioral assumptions, generating non-robust solutions.  We propose an innovative approach to modeling a city evacuation process that can produce robust solutions.  These solutions have the potential to lend insight for the development of simple, decentralized strategies for evacuation."
