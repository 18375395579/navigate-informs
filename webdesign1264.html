2012"Parking is a significant component of any urban transportation system. This presentation introduces a network-based parking search model in a stochastic environment, along with a multi-user equilibrium formulation with recourse.  This formulation can be used to predict the impact of changes in parking pricing or availability policies, or the introduction of parking information systems."
