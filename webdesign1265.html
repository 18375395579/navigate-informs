2012"The widely studied Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model is formulated in Eulerian coordinate system. We formulate the LWR model in the Lagrangian coordinates and propose a numerical algorithm for solving the PDE with multiple value conditions. This is applied to highway mobile sensing, data fusing and traffic estimation."
