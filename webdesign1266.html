2007"SDG assists many energy companies with major environmental investment decisions.  While we typically use a traditional decision analysis framework to address such investments, we have found it valuable to apply real option analysis as a parallel, complementary tool.  In this presentation, we will revisit differences between real options and decision analysis, build an integrated framework, and review a case study where we applied this technique to an emissions control investment decision."
