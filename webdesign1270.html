2008"Two heuristic systems, Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems, are developed to estimate option prices. The models are tested on S&P-500 Index options. The results are compared to those obtained by Black-Scholes method. A detailed error analysis is carried out comparing the relative efficiencies of all the three methods."
