2012"Although building and validating simulation models of complex systems is no easy task, the real value of the models comes from their use and acceptance after validation is complete.  While continuing to build additional hump yard models with Innovative Scheduling, CSX has worked to create processes that derive value from the existing models.   This presentation will show how CSX has used the Hump Yard Simulation System to make better decisions in tactical, strategic and conceptual scenarios."
