2008"We investigate whether airlines that are close to their productivity or asset frontiers face steeper tradeoffs between aircraft utilization and performance, than those that are further away, using ten years of data, and controlling for variability in travel time, capacity flexibility, load factor, and other key variables. Our analysis enables us to explain differences in on-time performance across airlines as a function of key operational variables, and provide insight on how to manage delays."
