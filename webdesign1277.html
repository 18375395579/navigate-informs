2007"Contact tracing (also known as partner notification) is a primary means of controlling infectious diseases such as TB, HIV, and STDs. However, little work has been done to determine the optimal level of investment in contact tracing. We develop and apply a simulation model of contact tracing and the spread of an infectious disease among a network of individuals in order to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of different levels of contact tracing."
