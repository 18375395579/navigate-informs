2013"In this paper Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the impact of uncertainties in biomass availability and cost, moisture content (MC), higher heating value (HHV) and electricity price on the profit of a biomass power plant. The deterministic optimization model considers biomass procurement, storage, electricity production and ash management. It is a mixed integer non-linear model with monthly time-steps over a one-year time horizon."
