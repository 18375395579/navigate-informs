2008"We consider a large-scale stochastic simulation with correlated inputs and develop a Bayesian framework that provides point estimates and confidence intervals for performance measures by accounting for stochastic and multivariate input uncertainties. We demonstrate the importance of the joint representation of stochastic and multivariate input uncertainties for multi-product inventory simulations."
