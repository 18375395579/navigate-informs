2013"We study a model for cascade effects over finite networks based on a deterministic binary linear threshold model. We first characterize the limiting behavioral properties of the dynamics. We then study the complexity of decision/counting problems that arise within the context. We finally propose a measure of network resilience that captures the nature of the involved dynamics, prove bounds and investigate the resilience of different network structures under this measure."
