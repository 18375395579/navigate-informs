2007"Two well-grounded motivational models, command-and-control and self-regulation, which are viewed as competing explanations of why individuals follow rules, are used to explain employees' adherence to information systems security policy (ISSP).  We aim to identify specific factors drawn from each of the two competing approaches that determine the level of employees' adherence to ISSP, and to develop and empirically test a conceptual model based on the two groups of determinants to be identified."
