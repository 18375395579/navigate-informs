2007"The study goal was to assess the costs and effectiveness of a HIV behavioral intervention to reduce the transmission risk from the HIV-infected persons to their uninfected sexual partners. We considered various behavioral interventions from published studies.  The Monte Carlo simulation model was used to convert the intermediate outcomes of theses studies to the number of infections averted, quality-adjusted life years saved, and monetary benefits/costs."
