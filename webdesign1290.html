2008"We look at whether lodging properties can use occupancy data to improve demand forecast accuracy in their food and beverage outlets, using 4 hotels with a total of 41 outlet & day part combinations.  We examine 27 forecasting methods, which we test using an 8 week holdback.  In 34 cases, the best forecast originated with one of the models incorporating occupancy, and the accuracy improved over 14% on average.  Our findings will be of interest to food and beverage managers in lodging properties."
