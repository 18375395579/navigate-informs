2007"Classical approaches to manufacturing line design have usually concerned serial configurations of identical machines. We developed mixed integer programming models for maximizing (1) cost-effectiveness of line configurations for multiple product models by the appropriate combinations of dedicated and flexible machines, and (2) the similarity of manufacturing tasks assigned to a machine for different product models."
