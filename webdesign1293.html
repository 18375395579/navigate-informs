2007"In this research a decision making model proposed for dynamic portfolio management. An agent who has some initial wealth invests in a market. Two types of asset are considered, riskless asset (bank account or bond), and risky asset (stock). The agent should choose an action to change the portfolio based on the environment. An action may have a fixed space or unfixed space. If the agent does not take any action, events (observable and unobservable) will change the market and value of portfolio.  The general problem is how to enable an agent to maximize an external reward signal by taking an action in an environment. Here, dynamic portfolio management is studied as mathematically modeled by a Semi-Markov Decision Processes (SMDP). To optimize this model, Q-learning as reinforcement learning technique has been applied."
