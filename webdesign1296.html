2012"This paper presents a dynamic control model for optimizing lane-based signal merge (LBSM) operations at freeway work zones. The control objective is to maximize the throughput. GA is employed to solve the model. Results reveal that the proposed method yields much better performance than traditional merge strategies under heavy traffic conditions."
