2008"We consider the problem of monitoring data corresponding to a sequence of lifetime tests. The main difficulty of the monitoring problem is related to the dynamic nature of the data acquisition process, as the information collected at consecutive points in time generally affects data for a broad range of lifetime tests in progress. In this paper we present an approach to monitoring such type of data and give examples related to the problem of monitoring reliability of computer components."
