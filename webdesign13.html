2012"We compute the value of a variance swap when the underlying is modeled as a Levy subordinated diffusion process.  The underlying in this framework may exhibit jumps with a state-dependent Levy measure, as well as local stochastic volatility and default intensity.  Moreover, the Levy subordinator can be obtained directly from European call/put prices."
