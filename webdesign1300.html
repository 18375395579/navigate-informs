2013"A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is presented to optimize green building design over multiple performance objectives. Performance objectives are predicted via treed regression models developed using design and analysis of computer experiments with eQUEST software as the computer experiment. Results of single story building case study were studied. Future study includes sequential design of experiments to minimize the computer runs and improve the optimization."
