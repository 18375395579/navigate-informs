2007"The rise of service oriented software architectures and formal  ontologies presents an opportunity for integration of previously standalone optimization and other models into enterprise-wide systems. This paper describes a service which links the Army's Mobility Common Operational Picture data model and ontology with a network flow optimization application, a command and control system, and a discrete event simulation to explore intelligent route finding in response to unexpected events."
