2007"This talk presents a service allocation model developed to support a long-term planning exercise in Fraser Health, a British Columbia Health Authority with a population of over 1.5 million and overseeing the operation of 12 acute care hospitals in a vast geographic region.    An optimization model is used to decide the clinical service mix and capacity to be allocated at each hospital in the network in every decision period, based on population needs and leading clinical practices."
