2008"Currently there is much interest in mapping genes involved in complex human diseases using whole-genome association studies. Harnessing the full power of these studies requires addressing several challenging computational problems including genotype phasing, genotype error detection, and missing data imputation. This talk will review inapproximability results and efficient heuristics for finding maximum-likelihood solutions to these problems based on Hidden Markov Models of haplotype diversity."
