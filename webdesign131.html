2006"We propose a methodology for corporate bond portfolio optimization in a multi-period environment with transaction costs. Our methodology melds stochastic programming with receding horizon control, essentially breaking down the portfolio optimization problem into a sequence of problems solved over time. Through Monte Carlo simulation of reduced form defaultable bonds, we demonstrate results showing our methodology can significantly outperform other methodologies."
