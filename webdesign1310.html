2007"We formulate a model to assess the impact on the spread of  mosquito-borne diseases of a strategy that releases male insects homozygous for a lethal genetic trait. A dynamic model for the female mosquito population, which incorporates the competition for female mating between released mosquitoes and wild mosquitoes,  density-dependent competition during the larval stage, and realization  of the lethal trait either before or after the larval stage, is embedded  into a human-vector epidemic model."
