2013"This article studies selective assembly for a two-component assembly system with finite buffers, where each component can exhibit different quality behaviors. Such a model is applicable to battery assembly process to improve quality. Analytical methods based on a two-level decomposition procedure are developed to evaluate the system performance, and the estimation accuracy is justified numerically. In addition, structure properties are investigated to provide insights on performance improvement."
