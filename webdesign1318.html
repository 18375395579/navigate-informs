2008"The analysis of event sequence data that contains failure events is becoming increasingly important in the design of service and maintenance policies. This paper presents a systematic methodology to construct a statistical prediction model for failure event based on event sequence data by combining the frequent failure signature and Cox model approaches. The proposed method can help proactively diagnose machine faults with a sufficient lead time before actual system failures."
