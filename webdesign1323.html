2013"Unit commitment is one of the most critical tasks to determine the generator schedules in power grid operations. Robust unit commitment models align with the high reliability standards in the power industry. This talk focuses on the whole process from modeling the historical data as uncertainty sets jointly with the robust models to determine reliable solutions. Numerical experiments show the computational efforts and solution reliability with alternative approaches to model the uncertainties."
