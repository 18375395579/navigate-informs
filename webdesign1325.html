2008"Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) has been widely used in semiconductor manufacturing industry to polish surface of wafers with more planarity. This paper proposes a method of online dynamic modeling to estimate and predict process state parameters, and further predict MRR. The fundamental challenge of this task is the non-linear nature of the CMP processes. This challenge is tackled by applying particle filtering method, to capture the non-linear dynamic of the CMP process."
