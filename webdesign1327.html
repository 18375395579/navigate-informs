2013"We extend the theory of importance sampling to estimate a system's reliability with a stochastic computer simulation. The proposed method aims to minimize the variance of failure probability estimator in a complex stochastic system. The method is applied to evaluate the reliability of a wind turbine based on computationally expensive aerodynamic simulations. The implementation results show that significant computational gains can be obtained, compared with other methods."
