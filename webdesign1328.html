2007"There are about 98,000 annual U.S. deaths due to medical errors.  The potential to reduce this error exists by conducting systematic analysis of near-misses. A dynamic methodology is proposed to report, classify and analyze near-misses to then assess the likelihood of the occurrence of errors and trigger a timely alarm."
