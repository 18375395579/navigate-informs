2008"A common problem in engineering is that the models developed based on the underlying physics of the process do not always match satisfactorily with reality. This work proposes engineering-statistical models that combine the advantages of engineering models and statistical models. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated using the prediction of surface roughness in a micro-cutting process and the optimization of a laser assisted mechanical micromachining process."
