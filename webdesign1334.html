2013"Many patients face difficulties to access medical facilities in the U.S. To alleviate these difficulties, several medical centers offer shuttle services to patients. In this paper, we study an integrated routing and scheduling model for a stream of patients with outpatient surgery requests with the objective of minimizing the total service time cost for all the patients. Our numerical study reveals that health care providers can improve the quality of their services by our unified framework."
