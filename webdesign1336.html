2007"The problem of detection and identification of an unobservable  change in the distribution of a random sequence is formulated via a  hidden Markov model approach.  The formulation is Bayesian, on-line,  discrete-time, allowing multiple disorders with dependent  observations, statistical dependencies between the change-time and  change-type, and general discrete-time disorder distributions.  Optimality results and numerical examples will be given."
