2012"We introduce the Sustainable IT  Services (SUITS) framework to develop models for operational  performance of an IT Service Provider in a global environment  with carbon taxation and carbon credit trading markets. The  models are used to formulate a revenue optimization problem  for the IT Service Provider in this environment. The model  solutions can provide guidance for designing operational level  of different IT components and for creating effective strategies  for trading in carbon markets."
