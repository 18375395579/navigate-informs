2008"Given that Malmquist productivity index can be decomposed to identify technical change relative to a variable returns to scale technology, it is shown that the "technical change" component does not fully characterize the shift in the frontier if the change is "non-neutral", meaning the frontier shift is not uniform across all input and output combinations. A general model and the nonparametric regression is presented to solve the problem. The method is applied to a commercial banking data set."
