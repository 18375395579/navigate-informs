2008"We use genetic algorithm for learning heterogeneous classification of network intrusions. Exploiting GA&#8217;s ability to find multiple intrusion patterns with similar accuracies, modified bagging techniques are used in a layered intrusion detection model, improving the intrusion signaling through provision of type of intrusion. Our approach also significantly increases detection accuracy for all classes of intrusions accompanied with reduced false positives compared to traditional methods."
