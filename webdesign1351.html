2012"This study investigates emission and stock abatement policy decisions by the use of a stochastic optimal control model. We begin with our discussion by applying an absolute continuous control to emission flow abatement and management. Then, we extend the model to a direct control of carbon stock. We introduce a specific feature of the cost structure for stock control and assume the cost function is described as a discontinuous and subadditive one. For this extension, we use an impulse control."
