2007"Inefficiency, as measured by the input oriented data envelopment analysis model, assumes two warehouses that can reduce different inputs by the same proportion are equally inefficient.  A new directional distance model (DDM) has recently been developed that allows contraction of inputs at different rates.  However, methods for identifying the direction of improvement are currently lacking.  We will discuss how to identify the direction to use in the DDM for the case warehouse evaluation."
