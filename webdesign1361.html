2013"We present a novel predictive-control approach that allows an electricity provider to monitor and proactively manage peak and off-peak residential intra-day electricity usage in an emerging smart energy grid using time-dependent dynamic pricing incentives. We develop a forecast model for intra-day shares of a total daily load, which is then embedded within a global optimization framework for managing the daily electricity usage."
