2013"POET (Purdue Optimization model Education Tool) is a web-based visual interactive tool to help students form optimization models from word problems. We assessed its effectiveness with 79 engineering students in an undergraduate optimization course. Our pre- and post-test results show that POET did not drastically improve students?modeling skills,  but did help them avoid particular types of errors. We will present how instructors can use POET as a supplementary tool in an optimization class."
