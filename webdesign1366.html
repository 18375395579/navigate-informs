2006"A new diagnosis methodology is proposed for identifying multiple process faults in multi-stage manufacturing processes (MMP).  Engineering knowledge represented as a pattern matrix is employed in directing the rotation of factor loadings, which are extracted from measurement covariance matrix, to estimate the true geometric relationships between process faults and quality variables."
