2006"This talk presents a general framework in which motor vehicle travel risks can be systematically estimated, flexibly displayed, and interactively compared.  Drawing upon existing data (FARS and NHTS), this tool determines risk estimates using per mile, per trip, or per minute measures for millions of attribute combinations (age, gender, time of day, day of week, month, vehicle type, geographic region, etc.)."
