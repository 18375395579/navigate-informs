2008"We consider a market with several large-scale service-providers that compete on both prices and service-levels. We introduce a framework that combines many-server heavy-traffic analysis with the concept of $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium to obtain first-order and second-order characterization for the equilibria in this market. The framework allows us to go significantly beyond the tractability boundaries imposed by the regular Nash equilibrium analysis."
