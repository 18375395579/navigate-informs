2012"While the development of splitting rate model (Smith and Mounce, 2011) overcomes the unrealism in path-based models, it contains an ad-hoc step of flow adjustment, for the purpose of maintaining the flow conservation. In this talk, we propose a general formulation for a class of flow splitting models, which endogenously preserves the flow conservation. We also analyze the asymptotic stability of a flow splitting model, when we specify the outflow splitting function as a projection operation."
