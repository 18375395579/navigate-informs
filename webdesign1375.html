2013"We model an innovation ecosystem as a directed network of firms, simulate a full spectrum of such networks with varied hierarchy degrees, and evaluate their “performance landscapes?using "NK model". Results show hierarchy in ecosystems gives rise to landscape ruggedness, indicating a higher chance for an ecosystem to be locked at local optima and unable to evolve, and higher tendency of firm behaviors and strategies toward exploitation rather than exploration."
