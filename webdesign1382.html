2013"SIR models that account for distributed susceptibility, adaptive contact/mixing rates, and affinity are studied. We highlight the use of a variety of techniques in the modeling heterogeneities within an SIR context.  Model outcomes are evaluated under random mixing and alternative forms of heterogeneity: qualitative equivalence, relative disease severity, and tractability."
