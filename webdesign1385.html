2013"After a disaster, humanitarian organizations quickly assemble a workforce to serve a community's needs. However, these needs and the volunteer base can change over time. We compare the use of two volunteer assignment methods: a scenario-based math programming model and a system dynamics model. We examine the changes in volunteer assignments based on several key cost parameters, need likelihood scenarios, and volunteer training opportunities. Numeric examples are then presented and discussed."
