2007"The CIP Modelling and Analysis (CIPMA) Program will provide Australian governments and industry with a quantitative understanding of the vulnerability or resilience of national CI systems and networks across a number of priority industry sectors (including energy, communications, water, etc.). CIPMA integrates the geospatial analysis and visualisation of CI networks, with system dynamic models that simulate system behaviour and business rules that are applied to network disruptions."
