2013"In this paper, we explore the economics of free under perpetual licensing for modular software. We focus on two emerging software business models: feature-limited freemium and seeding. We benchmark their performance against a conventional business model under which software is sold without free offers. Our model accounts for WOM effects and cross-module synergies. Our analysis uncovers conditions under which freemium and seeding are the dominating models under both constant and dynamic pricing."
