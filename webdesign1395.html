2012"Image analysis is an important method of statistical process control in manufacturing. It is difficult to obtain suitable images for defect detection and analysis when products have irregular surfaces. Three-dimension surface scanner can get the surface information, but the data is difficult to analyze directly due to massive data points. We propose a method to generate image by point cloud data from surface scanner, which can be used in defect analysis."
