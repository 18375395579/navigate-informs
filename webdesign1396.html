2012"In an outpatient setting, patients arriving for a single appointment may unexpectedly find that they must return for one or more follow-up  appointments. This paper develops a Markov decision process (MDP) to model this phenomenon when the regular patients have to book their visits in advance. We derive an approximately optimal policy to this MDP and evaluate its performance by simulations."
