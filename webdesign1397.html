2008"This paper studies a way to increase stability and reliability of the Internet interconnection network. First, we summarize various interconnection options. Then, conducted is a series of experiments to identify the weakest point of the current Internet interconnection system. Based on our simulation results, we present not only the guidelines for a robust interconnection architecture, but also a risk analysis framework to evaluate pros and cons of interconnection alternatives."
