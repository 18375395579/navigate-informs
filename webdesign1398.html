2013"Revenue management models heavily rely on the carrier’s historical booking patterns to forecast passenger demand and to recommend optimal inventory controls.  We are presenting a new integrated model for pricing airline tickets that takes into account the perceived value of multiple services in different competitive environments.  Our integrated model includes a classical aggregate planner for services as well as a share of choice model and can be implemented as a decision support tool."
