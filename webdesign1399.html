2006"We present an IP model for heterogeneous workforce tour scheduling, which has wide range of applications in public services. Its modeling capabilities include multiskill workforce, productivity, multiple tour types, variable start-times, and multiple breaks. We report on the computational performance of a column generation approach to solve this model efficiently."
