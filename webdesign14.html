2012"In this presentation, we will discuss various roles data can play when running a Monte Carlo simulation analysis, starting from data collection, distribution modeling, and sensitivity analysis. We will also discuss a few data-cleansing procedures, and some best-practices. We will use Oracle Crystal Ball as an example implementation."
