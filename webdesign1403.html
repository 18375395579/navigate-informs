2007"In the event of an earthquake first responders will be routed from their bases to the hot-spots. Nevertheless, the road network might have suffered such disastrous damage in unknown links, that routing through these links is impossible. In our study, we provide a robust operational response methodology for addressing the problem of routing in a network of unknown condition. A case study is presented in the seismically prone region of South-West Indiana."
