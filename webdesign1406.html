2012"We present a system dynamics mathematical model and agent-based model, which model and simulate the basic components of innate immune response of Acute Inflammatory Response (AIR), the initial stage of sepsis. Results show different pathological situations of patients under various interventions of anti-inflammatory cytokines in AIR evolution. We also suggest a strategy for intervention of anti-inflammatory cytokines as potential therapeutic agents in the clinical settings."
