2008"The operations of an air charter service for conference sports are modeled in competition with existing scheduled travel options.  The demand subset and the routing and scheduling of aircraft are done in the same framework.  Through this modeling we develop an innovative method for formulating and accommodating continuous time windows and competitive market dynamics.  We apply the model to a specific sports conference, which provides insight into the market for such a service."
