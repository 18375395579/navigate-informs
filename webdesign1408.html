2013"Among various sensing techniques, image sensors have attracted special attention in process monitoring due to rich process information provided by these sensors. The main objective of this research is to use low-rank tensor decomposition techniques and develop image-based monitoring methods that effectively utilize the spatial and color information of image data. Using simulation and a case study, the performance of the proposed methods is evaluated under various scenarios."
