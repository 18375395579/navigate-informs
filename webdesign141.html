2007"In this study, we develop a Markov modeling framework to represent the community-based care delivery process of chronic diseases. This approach enables us to represent the patient flow information in a compact form and to analyze the care delivery process in terms of the flow patterns and to assess the impact of the flow patterns on health outcomes. The model constitutes a tool for clinicians and system planners in developing an understanding of the disease-specific community care process."
