2013"We develop a structural model for multi-unit sequential Dutch auctions in a complex B2B context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explicitly models the sequential aspects of Dutch auctions using structural econometric analysis. Further, we demonstrate how the structural properties can be used to perform policy counterfactuals and develop intelligent software agents that facilitate auctioneer’s real-time decision making."
