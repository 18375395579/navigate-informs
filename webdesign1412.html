2007"Agent-based simulations (ABS) produce results similar to conventional simulations, but the agent focus adds some new dimensions not addressed in discrete event simulation output analysis. A goal of agent-based simulation is to better understand how system behavior at the macro-level results from the agents?behavioral rules at the micro-level. Another challenge is to recognize and characterize emergent behavior. This presentation identifies unique aspects of ABS output analysis."
