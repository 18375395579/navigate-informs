2013"We make a probability analysis of airport's flight delay factors based on Bayesian Network to modify the flight delay propagation tree.A set of measuring indices is developed to evaluate schedule reliability and economy.This model can evaluate the influence of airports,airlines and passengers on flight delay.Two flight schedules from an Chinese airline are compared and shows that this modified delay propagation tree is feasible and has practical value."
