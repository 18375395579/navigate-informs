2007"We describe a cost optimization model that can be applied to establish location usage targets and control traffic to meet performance requirements within a distributed Internet service platform.  We describe the common structure used to price resource utilization per deployed location. The structure of the model shares much in common with a large scale stochastic mathematical program.  We conclude by describing how the model can be applied to manage resource costs across a billing period."
