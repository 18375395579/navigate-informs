2013"Access to quality healthcare services is often a challenge for rural patients. It is even more challenging when a patient tries to make appointments with multiple providers. The underlying cause is related to the lack of timely sharing of patient medical information. A patient scheduling problem using a healthcare information sharing system is discussed here. A simulation analysis is used to model and analyze the problem providing insights into the value of shared information."
