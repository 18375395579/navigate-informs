2013"Motivated by its rising prominence, we investigate to what extent the offshore outsourcing approach can effectively transfer to complex and uncertain knowledge-intensive work like R&D, by developing a simulation model based on a sample of such projects by a leading vendor. We contrast the global delivery model with a consulting model, and find that each approach is more efficacious at handling different types of tasks, bearing implications for notions of firm boundaries and organizational forms."
