2008"Modeling and predicting the performance of interdependent infrastructure systems in order to prepare for and recover from catastrophic events is important for emergency management and resource allocation. This work will show how a synthetic, yet realistically developed city can be used for modeling and evaluating the performance of power and water systems during fire spread events."
