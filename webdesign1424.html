2013"A methodology is proposed to compliment the subjective “value?of intelligence with an objective metric of “impact?of information on network models.  It would measure the impact of a piece of information on a network’s metric, in this case being used to answer intelligence analyst questions.  In this paper, we explore data of tweets and apply the methodology to the links between twitter users to determine their quantitative impact on the overall network."
