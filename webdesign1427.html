2008"An empirically grounded model of the operating curve a high tech manufactuiring facility, which is sufficiently accurate to make capitalization decisions, has been developed. The model is used to simulate the performance of a hypothetical facility that operates  under very realistic conditions. Results of the simulation show that the value of additional technological knowledge can be negative. Learning more of a good thing is not always a good idea!"
