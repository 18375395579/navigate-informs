2013"Network models have been widely used in many subject areas to characterize the interactions between physical entities. A typical problem is to identify the network for multiple related tasks. We proposed a transfer learning approach that can leverage the knowledge gained during the modeling of one task to help better model another task, by adopting a Bayesian hierarchical model framework and L1-regularization. We used this model for biomarker discovery for Alzheimer's disease from fMRI data."
