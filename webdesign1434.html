2008"We present a new nonparametric method for generating patient-specific survival distributions at the time of kidney transplantation or addition to the transplant waitlist, based on a K-nearest neighbors approach.  Separate forecasts are generated for each donor scenario (living, SCD, ECD).  The method can be used by patients and physicians as a decision-support tool to compare treatment options. Predictive accuracy results are presented."
