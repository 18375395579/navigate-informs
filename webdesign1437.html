2013"Medical surveillance data often fail to deliver precise categorization of cases. However, imprecisely categorized cases still carry more specific information than uncategorized ones; and utilizing this while mining the data may hence improve the results. With real-world data from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, we show how fully utilizing such data contributes to population studies of cancer patients. Challenges of using imprecise categorical data are also discussed."
