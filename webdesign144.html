2006"We describe and make available three web-based simulations that help to teach concepts related to process flow and variability.  These programs simulate, (i) A G/G/1 queue, (ii) A single-stage process to demonstrate the long-run validity of Little’s Law and (iii) A continuous-time reorder point/reorder quantity inventory system.  We offer evidence of how the simulations have helped the students to learn, including documentation from a web-based exercise with the queueing simulator."
