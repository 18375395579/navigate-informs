2006"Machine learning has had success in modeling and optimizing commercial processes.  A recent trend is to observe that the scientific method is a process that can be approached similarly.  We consider discovery of CNS drugs using in vivo behavioral testing.  We discuss: kernel density estimators for improved probabilities in multi-class problems; semi-supervised learning for training data with uncertain class labels; and active learning to control experimentation for drug discovery."
