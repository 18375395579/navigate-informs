2012"We present a stochastic optimization model in which decisions for wind generation are implemented at a far greater pace than those for thermal units.  This multi-scale model adopts a combination of approximate dynamic programming and stochastic decomposition (ADP/SD) to accommodate the different time-scales.  Our computational results are based on injecting wind simulations into the ADP/SD algorithm."
