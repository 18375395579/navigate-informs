2013"When the defense and attack efforts are continuous, contest success functions (CSFs) are used to model the probability of a successful attack as a function of the defender and the attacker investment. Most CSFs in the literature assume diminishing marginal returns, which may not hold in practice when the investments are small. We use a class of partially-concave-partially-convex CSFs to model such “warm-up?effects, and study the impact of such effects on equilibrium attack and defense efforts."
