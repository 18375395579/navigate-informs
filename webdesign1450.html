2006"The logit route choice model allows one to model commuter behavior in a network both realistically and in a computationally affordable way. We consider a network toll-setting problem based on a bilevel programming framework where the reaction of the commuters is modelized with a logit model. Observations will be made concerning the general features of the revenue function and a parallel with the deterministic toll setting problem established."
