2012"We consider optimal ambulance diversion control policies with the objective of minimizing patients' waiting time higher than a recommended safety time threshold. We model the problem using a Markov decision process formulation, and characterize the optimal ambulance diversion decisions. We compare the performance of our policy with simple heuristics using a simulation model, and analyze the value of information in ambulance diversion decisions."
