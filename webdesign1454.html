2013"In rail dispatch each absent employee must be covered by a qualified extra board dispatcher or through the use of overtime.  Using data on historical absences, we employ a Poisson regression to identify factors influencing the number of absences. We then analyze the qualifications of current dispatchers and develop a simulation model to predict how changes in the workforce size and qualifications impact the cost of handling unplanned absences."
