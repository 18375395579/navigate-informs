2013"The U.S. has begun development of high-speed rail (HSR) services since 2009. Many of planned or proposed HSR systems use shared corridors in which freight and passenger trains with heterogeneous configurations and operating characteristics will use the same tracks. This talk will present a decision support model that can help evaluate the impact of high-speed passenger trains on freight corridor capacity."
