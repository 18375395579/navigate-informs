2013"In this talk, we introduce the use of a simulation metamodeling technique for efficient estimation of risks and their sensitivities. In particular, stochastic kriging is employed to build metamodels for value-at-risk, expected shortfall, and their sensitivity surfaces. We also show how the standard stochastic kriging can be generalized to enhance the predictive performance of the MSE-optimal stochastic kriging predictor."
