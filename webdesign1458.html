2012"Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models represent the state of the art in economic impact analysis.  With assistance from the University of Southern California's Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) has recently begun to develop a CGE model to advance the input-output (I-O) models currently used to estimate losses associated with terrorism, natural hazards, transnational crimes, and industrial accidents."
