2007"A stochastic model that captures the vaccine supply during production interruptions is used to assess the impact of vaccine stockpile levels on the probability that all children can be immunized according to the childhood immunization schedule. The model evaluates the recommended vaccines stockpile levels in the US. Results suggest that a moderate investment in higher vaccine stockpile levels would reduce the risk of vaccine shortages for production interruptions lasting more than six months."
