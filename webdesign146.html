2012"Humanitarian operations are often subject to severe resource and time constraints.  In order to make the best use of these limited resources and to incorporate learning into subsequent disaster recovery efforts, the humanitarian efforts need to be evaluated along both quantitative and qualitative measures.  This research effort seeks to contribute to the ability to tie together long-term decision-making and policy analysis to create more sustainable and disaster-resilient communities."
