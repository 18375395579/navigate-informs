2012"Statistical inference for nanostructure growth models is typically drawn from small scale laboratory-level experiments. To scale up nanostructure growth, it is necessary to expand the scope of inference to super-populations which mimic actual manufacturing conditions. A framework for causal inference, based on potential outcomes, can provide a solution to this challenging problem."
