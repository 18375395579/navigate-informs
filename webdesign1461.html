2012"Decision making in infrastructure systems involves both preparedness and post-disaster decisions. Using a set of stochastic metrics, network resilience is modeled to minimize the cost and the time to full recovery of the failed system, consequently guiding decision making and resource allocation after the disruptive event. This methodology is applied to the Mississippi River Navigation System using simulation scenarios of possible accidents, natural disasters, or manmade attacks."
