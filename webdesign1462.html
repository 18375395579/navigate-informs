2012"Telemedicine is critical to ensure the timely delivery of health care to patients, especially those who live in the rural areas. However, there are a number of uncertainty factors inherent to the telehealthcare, for e.g., the personnel with minimal training. This paper presents our efforts to integrate multiscale recurrence analysis with self-organizing map for controlling the signal quality. The efficacy and robustness of this approach are validated using real-world telemedicine recordings."
