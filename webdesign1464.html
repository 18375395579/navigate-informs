2008"We consider the problem of predicting the likelihood that a company will purchase a new product from a seller. We extend previous structured firmographic models to include text-based features based on analysis of company websites. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating such web content can significantly improve customer targeting. Furthermore, we present methods to actively select only the web content that is likely to improve our models, while reducing the costs of acquisition."
