2012"We developed a discrete-event simulation model of a local health department and its response to a pertussis outbreak. Contact tracing, a key mitigation method for pertussis, is modeled using the NC DHHS case data. The impact of the time to initiate response and the resource availability of the health department on outbreak management policies are explored and optimal response policies are developed."
