2008"The representation of  technological change in large energy-economic model remains highly  stylized relative to the state-of-the-art of understanding about the economics of innovation.  We address this by combining expert elicitations with a bottom-up manufacturing cost model to simulate the cost reductions that result from technology-push and demand-pull technology policies for organic photovoltaics."
