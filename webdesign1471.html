2008"Effects-Based Operations (EBO) is a modern military planning concept that approaches the planning from a systems perspective by taking into account multiple goals of an operation. We present a new EBO planning process based on multi-criteria decision analysis. In the process, a system model and a method for evaluating effects are needed. We illustrate a case including a multi-criteria influence diagram."
