2012"We describe, model and optimize the reverse logistics of our industrial partner, a Fortune 500 company that sells consumer electronics. Based on real data, we introduce a discrete-time model that captures the dynamics of this reverse logistics system. In addition, using an approximate dynamic programming approach, we propose a closed-loop data-driven policy  for managing inventory. The performance of this policy is analysed theoretically and through numerical experiments."
