2012"In many applications such as bio-informatics, the estimation of the starting and ending points of drop-down in the longitudinal data is one of the key problems. We used a partial spline model based on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based spline and multiple change points. Since the existing criteria for the smoothing parameter selection in partial spline with change points are not proper, we propose simple and better criteria to estimate change points."
