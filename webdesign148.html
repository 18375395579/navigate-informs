2008"We present a new quality control strategy for unsynchronized batch processes. In our proposition, data arising from such batch processes are completed using a straightforward scheme to preserve all information on the variability in batch profiles along the time axis. The completed data set is reduced using a three-way method and monitoring of batch performance is accomplished directly on principal plane graphs, from which non-parametric off-line and on-line control charts are derived."
