2013"We present a model for predicting the reliability of systems subject to degradation and impact loading considering the effect of system’s age on damage due to impact. We then extend this model by considering the correlation between the degradation and impacts.  The system reliability expressions of the proposed models are presented which are then validated through simulation modeling."
