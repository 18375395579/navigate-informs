2012"Variation control of surface shape becomes a key enabler of high-precision machining. This talk presents a method for efficiently measuring and monitoring variations of machined surfaces. Cutting force modeling is conducted and is correlated with surface spatial data to improve surface profile prediction. Using the prediction, a strategy under Bayesian framework is proposed to monitor surface variations without significantly increasing false alarms. A Ford case study demonstrates the method."
