2007"Medical decisions involve the interplay of many probabilistic variables, and decision alternatives with disparate outcomes, making model design and implementation difficult.  Structural conditions on the ID related to d-separation can determine if a variable's presence or absence will impact the scope and/or the normative results of the model.    We demonstrate the impact of these conditions by constructing two versions of a decision model for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism."
