2013"Graphene has many important properties and has been identified as a very efficient and cheap ingredient in a lot of industrial applications. Unfortunately, there has not been much work done in understanding the kinetics that drive the graphene growth process. We propose a rate-based model that correctly quantifies the uncertainty in our model parameters. We further extend the graphene shape model to account for possible spatial dependence using a lattice spatial model."
