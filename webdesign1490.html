2012"This presentation describes an optimization model to adjust the hourly load level of a given consumer in response to electricity prices. The objective of the model is to maximize the consumer utility. Price uncertainty is modeled through robust optimization techniques. The model materializes into a simple LP that can be integrated in the Energy Management System of a household or a small business. A simple bi-directional communication device enables the implementation of the proposed model."
