2006"We propose a methodology to price and hedge volatility derivatives. We derive a no arbitrage relationship between variance swaps and other volatility derivatives. Using this argument, we derive a partial differential equation to price volatility swaps and variance options in the Heston stochastic volatility model and compute the volatility and variance strikes using numerical transform inversion techniques and simulation."
