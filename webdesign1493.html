2008"The Haiku Electricity Market Model is a highly parameterized model of the US electricity sector with endogenous components for investment in generation capacity and pollution abatement technology, electricity prices and demand, interregional power trading, fuel markets, and pollution allowance markets. The model, presented here, is designed for policy analysis, particularly for environmental and climate policies."
