2006"Successful deployment of prognostic models requires prior knowledge of degradation processes. This information is available in databases consisting of degradation-based signals. Unfortunately, these databases may not be available for legacy systems, and their development can be very expensive. This research proposes a mathematical framework that enables the development of adaptive prognostic models for predicting residual life distributions in the absence of prior degradation information."
