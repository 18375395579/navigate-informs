2012"This paper measures the value of the stochastic solution for a system with penetration of renewable energy sources, by comparing it to a deterministic formulation with fixed locational reserves. Our model of the electricity network has a system planner seeking to minimize the cost of providing both energy and ancillary services using a security constrained Optimal Power Flow and explicitly reproducing the uncertainty in the system by using a Markovian transition probability matrix."
