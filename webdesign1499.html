2013"In this talk, we propose a risk-averse stochastic unit commitment model to hedge against incomplete information upon the volatile renewable energy. Our proposed model is based on real data samples collected in practice, and can ensure renewable energy utilization with a high probability. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence property of the risk-averseness of the model as the sample size grows."
