2006"We discuss non-overlapping packings of uniform and non-uniform size spheres into containers. The generic objective is to provide "tightest possible" packings: this leads to context-dependent model forms. We present model variants and illustrative numerical results, using MathOptimizer Professional (MOP). MOP is our Mathematica package with an easy-to-use interface to the LGO global/local optimization solver suite."
