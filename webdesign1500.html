2008"Low Latency Queueing (LLQ) is an Internet Protocol (IP) router discipline that is being used to ensure that performance-sensitive high priority traffic  receives a high level of performance, while allowing less performance-sensitive traffic to receive some portion of the bandwidth. We present a discussion of our experiences in modeling the performance of this system. The discussion involves the roles analytics, simulation, and the use of approximations have had in this development."
