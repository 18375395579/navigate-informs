2006"Community Health Centers (CHCs) provide family-oriented  health care services for people living in rural and urban  medically under-served communities; they are an important part of  the government's plan to make health care more affordable. We  develop an optimization model to determine the best location and  number of new CHCs in a geographical network, as well as what  specific services each CHC should offer at which level.  We  maximize the weighted demand coverage of the needy population  subject to budget and capacity constraints, where costs are fixed  and variable. We use statistical methods on national health  databases to determine important predictors of healthcare need,  and we apply these methods to Census data to obtain county-based  estimates of demand.  Using several healthcare performance  metrics, we analyze the results of the system approach to location  using the state of Georgia as a prototype.   We apply our model to  compare policies such as access versus coverage."
