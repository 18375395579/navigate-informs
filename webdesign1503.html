2012"We use patient flow data at a not-for-profit, specialty eye care clinic to investigate the impact of case-mix heterogeneity at the physician level on time spent by patients in the clinic after controlling for other operational factors such as overall workload, complexity of patients, fresh vs. follow-ups, appointments vs. walk-ins, paying vs. non-paying etc. We use the results of our analysis to empirically characterize the trade-off between efficiency and flexibility of individual physicians."
