2006"We extend the guaranteed service supply chain modeling framework to allow for an arbitrary integer review period or ordering frequency at each stage. We accommodate three different periodic review operating policies - constant base stock, constant safety stock, and adaptive base stock. We apply the model to real-world data and show that inventory metrics of the new model differ by more than 30% from those derived through the simpler modeling approach of aggregating a review period into leadtime."
