2012"As air traffic returns to its pre-recession levels, estimation of airport capacity for efficient planning of landing and takeoff and mitigation of congestion-induced delays, especially at nation’s busier airports, have become critical once again. Approaching representative airport’s capacity, however, in parametric fashion (i.e., analytic and numerical methods) provides an abstraction that, in many cases, may not be equivalent to tactical and the observed capacity. Using ASDE-X and combined with other publicly available data, we present an analytical and non-parametric empirical framework to estimate and project airport capacity that takes into account dependencies of runways to gate, taxiways and movement areas and airport systems; observed aircraft mix, types of queuing and other ATM requirements, weather conditions and runway characteristics."
