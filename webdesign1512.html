2013"A data-driven approach integrating discrete event simulation and meta-heuristic is proposed to find the optimal number of grafting workers and the size of cold storage in grafted seedling propagation simultaneously. The objective is to minimize the average order loss rate under various demand patterns while keeping certain investment payout period.  A large grafted seedling propagator (over 12 million plants grafted annually) in North America is used to demonstrate the proposed approach."
