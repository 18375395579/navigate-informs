2008"How do Wikipedia pages become stable and trusted information sources?  We analyze highly edited Wikipedia pages and show that they almost  inevitably converge to a stable state instead of continuing to accrue  edits (the expected behavior under traditional growth models).  We  present a stochastic model of information growth for Wikipedia pages  and show that this model provides an excellent fit to the actual  accumulation of edits on highly-edited Wikipedia pages."
