2006"We introduce a new simulation model, named VTASIM, developed for the analysis of airfield operations. Unique features of VTASIM are: 1) It is a discrete-time simulation model; 2) It can capture the communication activities between pilots and controllers; 3) To find efficient taxiing paths between gates and runway exits, the time-dependent shortest path algorithm is implemented, and 4) For runway operations, two types of aircraft sequencing (i.e., FCFS and optimized) methods are applied."
