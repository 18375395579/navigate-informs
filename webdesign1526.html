2012"We propose a multi-level polarity sentiment analysis framework that utilizes a Natural Language Processing technique: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to reduce feature dimensionality and a multi-classifier SVM to detect sentiment level. We conducted a series of experiments to estimate the optimal kernel parameters and the dimension of features. The results shows that LSA can effectively reduce term feature dimensions and the optimal dimension and kernel parameters can boost the performance."
