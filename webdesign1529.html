2012"Pay-for-performance (P4P) advertising schemes such as pay-per-click have grown in popularity. Meanwhile the traditional pay-per-impression (PPI) scheme persists, and advertising providers start to offer a hybrid mix of PPI and P4P schemes. We examine optimal pricing schemes and demonstrate a trade-off between using P4P schemes to reveal superior quality and using PPI to minimize allocative inefficiencies. We shed light on several provider strategies, including increasing use of hybrid schemes."
