2008"A new control chart will be developed to monitor a stationary autocorrelated process for a step change in the mean utilizing the likelihood ratio approach.  In addition to have excellent detection capabilities, the proposed control chart provides estimates for the change point and new value of the process mean.  Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the average run length performance of the proposed control chart applied to stationary first-order pure and mixed ARMA models."
