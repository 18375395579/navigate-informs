2012"We present a Bayesian predictive modeling approach for functional response systems. The goal is to optimize the shape, or profile, of the functional response under a robust parameter design scenario in which there are controllable and noise factors. The method is illustrated with real examples and model building and diagnostics aspects of the assumed mixed effects model are discussed. Alternative modeling strategies beyond those in the JQT paper (2012, 44(2)) will be presented."
