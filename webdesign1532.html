2012"The development of constraint-based scheduling solvers has been biased towards the satisfaction of the global constraint cumulative. Hence, a successful use of them to tackle many problems depends on leveraging such constraint in the model. In this work, we consider the scheduling of vessels to convey pipes that will connect offshore oil wells to producing units. To guarantee the loading of pipes by activities scheduled after their release, a qualitative property is modeled with such constraint."
