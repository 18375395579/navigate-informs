2012"We use operations management theory to study the effects of change in ambulance diversion policy in LA County, CA. We utilize a unique dataset obtained by combining ambulance dispatch data and hospital diversion status data over a period of 9 years from a network of seven closely located hospitals. We find that extent of time on diversion reduced significantly after the policy change but the number of diversions did not. We build empirical models provide possible explanations for these effects."
