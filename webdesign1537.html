2012"Inspired by a practical geographical detection problem, we examine the problem  of locating M/G/k+M type stations on a network in order to minimize abandonments.  We develop heuristic algorithms based on M/G/k+M queueing  approximations and use detailed simulation models to evaluate and enhance our   suggested policies."
