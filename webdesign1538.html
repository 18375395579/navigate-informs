2013"In condition based maintenance (CBM), component health condition is predicted using condition monitoring data. It is observed that the prediction accuracy improves with the increase of the age of the component. In this research, we develop a method to quantify the remaining life prediction uncertainty considering the prediction accuracy improvements, and an effective CBM optimization approach to optimize the maintenance schedule."
