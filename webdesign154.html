2006"Infectious disease co-epidemics involve the related spread of two or more diseases. We present two mathematical models of co-epidemics, including calculations of the basic reproduction number and stability analysis of equilibrium points.  We simulate the HIV-TB co-epidemics in India and evaluate the effects of various treatment and prevention programs on disease prevalence, new infections, and deaths over time. This research was in part supported by the Seth Bonder Scholarship for Applied Operations Research in Health Services."
