2006"We present a synthesis for parking capacity planning models incorporating demand uncertainty, and public bus transportation availability. Efforts include developing mathematical programming formulations to evaluate strategies that may increase the use of transit services. Models will assist decision-makers when determining future parking expansions in terms of timing, dimensions, and locations."
