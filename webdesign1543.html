2012"Mass-casualty triage currently relies on a fixed priority ordering among different classes of patients and does not explicitly consider resource limitations. The nominated study separates medical classification from prioritization and incorporates survival probabilities and resource limitations. Based on analytical and simulation results, additional lives can be saved by using the proposed policies to support decisions made by medical providers."
