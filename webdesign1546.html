2007"When quality characteristics cannot be measured on a continuous scale due to either inherent or outside constraints, qualitative observations can be collected alternatively. Under these situations, most conventional run-to-run (R2R) process control algorithms that are developed based on quantitative measurements cannot be implemented. In this paper, we develop a novel run-to-run control scheme that uses qualitative information for process adjustments."
