2012"This paper presents an optimization model to maximize the overall value of the supply chain of a typical forest biomass power plant with uncertainty. It considers biomass procurement, storage, energy production and ash disposal in an integrated framework at the tactical level. The nonlinear mixed integer programming model is solved using an outer approximation method. The developed model is applied to a real case biomass power plant and uncertainties are considered using different scenarios."
