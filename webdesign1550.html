2013"We present a pharmaceutical supply chain network model with outsourcing under price and quality competition in equilibrium and dynamic versions. This model allows for the determination of the optimal product flows of in-house and outsourcing activities and provides the firm the optimal make-or-buy and contractor selection decisions. We state the variational inequality formulation and the dynamic adjustment processes of the model, and present several numerical examples with sensitivity analysis."
