2013"In this paper, we develop two delayed degradation models based on destructive degradation test data to evaluate the reliability of a product with a random degradation initiation time. Fixed-effects and random-effects gamma processes are considered, respectively. EM algorithm is implemented to calculate the MLE in both models. Monte Carlo approach is used to obtain the confidence intervals."
