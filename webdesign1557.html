2013"Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is a method of predictive analytics that attempts to predict or classify using a set of continuous or categorical variables. In this research, using CART, a simulation model has been developed to observe transition states of stocks in a portfolio. Utilizing design of experiments, objective values are observed from the simulation at selected portfolio points. We then approximate the objective function to use in prescriptive analytics."
