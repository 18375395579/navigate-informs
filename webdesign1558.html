2007"A model of airport passenger security checkpoint operations using system dynamics and social judgment theory is presented. We model screening operations as a detection-selection problem of judgment embedded in a dynamic decision-making environment with multiple competing goals and strong socio-technical interactions. The model aims to capture a feedback-rich representation of the security checkpoint process in order to identify leverage points, leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness."
