2008"An integrated Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) modeling framework is proposed for human decision behavior, which involve Bayesian belief network, Decision-Field-Theory, and probabilistic depth first search technique.  Attributes of the model are reverse-engineered from human experiments conducted in CAVE.  The proposed BDI model is demonstrated for human’s evacuation behaviors under a terrorist bomb attack.  The environment and agents are implemented in AnyLogic agent-based simulation software."
