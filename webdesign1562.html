2012"N-1-1 contingency analysis considers the consecutive loss of two elements in a power system, with intervening time for operator adjustments. In this talk, we use mixed-integer programming approaches for N-1-1 contingency analysis. We test our models and algorithms on several IEEE test systems. Our computational experiments indicate potential for the models to augment comprehensive system operations models, such as unit commitment."
