2013"Supplier evaluation and selection is among the most critical logistics decisions in the supply chain management. In this paper, the results of an establishment survey are used to identify important criteria in evaluating and selecting a supplier from decision-making point of view. An optimization model is also developed for supplier selection for different industry sectors. The proposed model will be eventually implemented in an activity-based freight demand modeling framework for Chicago."
