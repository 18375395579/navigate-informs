2013"Stochastic discrete-event simulation models are developed to analyze the performance of the supply chain of forest-based biomass to wood pellets (solid biofuel) and combined heat and power. The models take into account the uncertainties in the quality of raw materials and interdependencies between different stages of the supply chain."
