2007"Adjustment factors play a crucial role in Taguchi's  approach to robust parameter design. However, the notion of  adjustment factors is not well defined and ambiguities exist in  the selection of those factors. In this article, we propose a  criterion for selecting adjustment factors. This new criterion can  be used to explain and extend Taguchi's approach. The concept is  illustrated using two examples."
