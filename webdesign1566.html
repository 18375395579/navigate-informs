2013"Managing toll lanes for profit is becoming increasingly common.  We consider the problem of finding revenue-maximizing tolls for a managed lane operator -- that is an operator who can charge a toll for some lanes on a highway while the others remain free to use.  We present some structural results on optimal tolls and use a simulation to evaluate the performance of different tolling schemes such as myopic, static, and dynamic tolling."
