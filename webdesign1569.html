2008"The talk presents case studies of taxi-out time prediction at Detroit, Washington Reagan, and Tampa International airports using approximate dynamic programming (ADP). The talk focuses on the quality improvement in airport surface management systems by better departure planning that can be achieved through accurate taxi-out time predications. The talk also points out the advantages of ADP over traditional regression and queueing models."
