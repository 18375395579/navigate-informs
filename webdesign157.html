2008"In this work we study a unique data set on the Chilean combinatorial auction for school meals, which runs every year to feed 1.3 million children with a budget of $200 million. We use bidding data to identify important features of the firms?cost structure. We use this information to evaluate changes to the allocation mechanism, such as changes in the set of combination bids allowed. More generally, our work shows how empirical analysis can be used to improve combinatorial auction design."
