2007"We present a dynamic model for the annual flu vaccine composition decision. An optimal threshold policy is derived for this decision. Due to the greater uncertainty in production yields of new vaccines, the optimal thresholds are neither symmetric between retaining and updating the composition nor monotonic over time. We apply our model to past decisions using parameter values estimated from a historical case. Our analysis shows that the optimal policy can significantly improve social welfare."
