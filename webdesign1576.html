2006"This paper proposes a W control chart to detect the sensor mean shift faults in discrete manufacturing processes based on a linear fault-quality model. The sensitivity of the W chart to the occurrence of sensor faults is studied.  A parameter called sensitivity preserving ratio (SPR) is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the control chart. In comparison with the control chart directly monitoring the product quality characteristics, our W chart can separate sensor faults from the process faults."
