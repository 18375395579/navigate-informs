2013"We propose a mathematical model for T2 Diabetes that comprehends the interactions of screening policies and preventive interventions. We use the model to design an integrated preventive care policy. We calibrate the model using real data, and compare the model outcomes with clinical recommendations. We conclude by providing insights on multi-level chronic disease prevention."
