2008"CSX Transportation is partnering with Innovative Scheduling to develop and implement several locomotive models and implementing them. In this presentation, we will describe the motivation for developing these models, how we developed them, how we are using them, and what are the benefits derived from the use of these models. We will also share with the audience the lessons learnt in this process."
