2006"In this paper we investigate several classes of stochastic models for customer choice, and their calibration from shopping data. We discuss different specifications of these models in terms of choice attributes, and study the implications for ticket pricing.    These methodologies are exemplified with a large data set of customer purchases of airline tickets."
