" 1 - Computational Modeling of Brain Activities in a Perceptual-motor Task"
Changxu (Sean) Wu, Assistant Professor, SUNY, Buffalo, 438 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14260, United States, changxu@buffalo.edu"
2007"In this talk, we describe how to use a queueing network approach and other computational methods to model brain activities when human subjects are performing a perceptual-motor task. The extension of our modeling approach in quantifying human performance and mental workload is also discussed."
