2007"The question of whether a given model is suitable for a given data series is not investigated rigorously in many cases. We review a commonly-used model for forward prices - the Schwartz-Smith two-factor model ?and develop formal specification tests to see if the model is an adequate representation of Californian power and gas prices. The answer is an unequivocal no. We conclude with recommendations and challenges for further research."
