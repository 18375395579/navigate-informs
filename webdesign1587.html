2008"There is an increasing interest in the behavior of learning curves for performance analysis.  In Physics, half-life is used to assess the stability of radioactive substances.  This provides an analogy for modeling half-life of learning curves with recognition of diminishing cost with respect to increases in production level.  In this paper, we introduce computational equations for half-life analysis of classical and contemporary learning curves with applications to project performance analysis."
