2012"Analysis of medical imaging data for monitoring disease progression or treatment efficiency has been extensively studied. However, the capability of imaging devices to produce repeatable measurements is yet to be studied. In this research, we utilize mixed-effect models to analyze repeatability of medical imaging systems using longitudinal brain MRI data when repeated scans are not available."
