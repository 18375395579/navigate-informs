2013"Complex systems usually demonstrate nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics. Time series data from those systems can represent casual and dynamic information about the underlying dynamics, and provide a unique way to monitor the system state evolution. We reviewed the recently developed models for nonlinear nonstationary time series prediction, and provided a comparative study."
