2013"We describe how to create a consistent and accurate simulation of how a sexual network changes over time using ego-centric network data collected from a longitudinal survey.  We then add HIV transmission to the model and use it to address various questions of interest.  The data is from a survey of young men who have sex with men in Chicago.  We describe how to overcome the key challenge: determining an accurate model for the formation of new partnerships."
