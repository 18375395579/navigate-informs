2007"A prototype is presented for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (D/FW).  Deicing and anti-icing fluids have a high concentration of glycol that can lead to increased bacterial growth in the receiving waters and reduced dissolved oxygen. Our prototype uses actual data for two primary tasks: (1) Construction of simulation model and (2) Development of a stochastic dynamic programming based optimization tool to dynamically assign airplanes to deicing pad locations."
