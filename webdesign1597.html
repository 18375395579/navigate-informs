2013"Nowadays railway network are instrumented with various wayside detectors. Previous railcar failure prediction method only utilizes single data source, such as wheel impact load detector (WILD). In this work, we present a methodology to fuse data from a variety of detectors, such as WILD, machine vision (MV), and optical geometry detector (OGD). Several data mining techniques are implemented and compared to predict the remaining life of railcar components in a national wide railway network."
