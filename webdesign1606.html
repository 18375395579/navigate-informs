2008"Patients with Type 2 diabetes are often prescribed statins as part of their treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. We propose a Markov decision process model that optimizes the statin treatment decision. We consider three different perspectives: the patient, society, and third-party payer. We present our model formulation, discuss structural properties, and present numerical results comparing the optimal treatment policy for the three different perspectives."
