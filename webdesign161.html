" 3 - Uncertain Aggregate Arriving Aircraft Operations in Atlanta Airspace"
Dr. Kenneth Kuhn, University Affiliated Research Center, kkuhn@arc.nasa.gov"
2007"This research translates radar echo top heights and vertically integrated liquid measures into measures of the aggregated behavior of aircrafts around Atlanta, Georgia.  A new methodology for this translation problem is introduced, notable for its ability to overcome the limitations on sizes of data sets considered and the restrictive model forms that hampered previous analyses.  Several interesting results are presented."
