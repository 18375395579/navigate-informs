2007"One question states struggle with is how to set water quality standards; this is particularly difficult for eutrophication control since different levels of nutrients cause different waterbody responses.  We developed a two-step procedure to set nutrient criteria: (1) we determined the most predictive measured variables using structural equation modeling, and (2) we assessed the optimal variable level using multiattribute utility analysis.  The procedure was applied to lakes in North Carolina."
