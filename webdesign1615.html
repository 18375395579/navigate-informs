2012"Carbon nanotube sheet, i.e. buckypaper (BP), is a multifunctional nanomaterial with extraordinary properties. Post treatment using poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) can further enhance the mechanical properties of BP. A finite element based mechanical model was developed to link PVA-treated BP’s modulus to its nanostructure characteristics. This model was then calibrated and adjusted using experimental data. The performance of the calibrated model was tested using the cross validation process."
