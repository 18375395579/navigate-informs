2013"IMPT is highly sensitive to uncertainties in beam range and patient setup. In the worst case and nominal scenarios, robustly optimized plans showed better target coverage, improved dose homogeneity, and lower or equivalent dose to organs at risk (OARs). Robust optimization provided significantly more robust dose distributions to targets and organs than conventional optimization in H&N using IMPT. Reduction of PTV and planning directly based on CTV provided better or equivalent OAR sparing."
