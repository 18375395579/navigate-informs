2013"Airlines and High-speed rail increasingly compete for passengers. Competition affects the number of captured passengers and revenues. We consider multi-modal competition and develop an approach that estimates the demand using a nested logit model, and generates schedules using an integrated optimization model. Our experimental results show how we replicate the current scheduling decisions of IBERIA (the major Spanish airline), and evaluate multiple scenarios accounting for demand stimulation."
