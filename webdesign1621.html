2006"Appointment scheduling systems are used by many health care providers to balance the utilization of resources with patient waiting time. In this talk we describe a stochastic optimization model for a commonly encountered outpatient surgery scheduling problem in specialty care clinics. We present insights about the model structure, special cases, and numerical results based on real data that illustrates the potential impact of our model in a clinical environment."
