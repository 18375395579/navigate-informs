2012"Autonomous wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting nodes are gaining prominence in long-lived remote surveillance applications.  Node sleep scheduling is a popular approach to ensure “energy-neutral?operation in these networks. We present a fluid model based analysis of performance of such a network under a threshold based sleep scheduling policy."
