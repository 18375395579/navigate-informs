" 2 - Change Detection for Complex Data"
George Runger, Profressor, Arizona State, United States of America, runger@asu.edu"
2013"The objective is to detect a change in a system based on high-dimensional, disparate data. Challenges Include: changes in only a few attributes (or only in sub-regions), big data is dirty data, no models  (nonlinearities).  A robust, scalable strategy will be presented that can be applied to different data representations such as traditional time-ordered data, events as point-processes in a high-dimensional space (of numerical and categorical attributes), or network transactions."
