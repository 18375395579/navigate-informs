2008"Many retail small store chain operators are eager to know how to quantitatively evaluate new store locations. In this paper, we propose a novel method which can predict the competitions among new/competing stores. We develop a model to estimate different customers' demand and the relationship between customers and multiple stores. A real case on the micro-competition analysis in a China city for one leading retail small store operators shows that our method is more practical and accurate."
