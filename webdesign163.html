2008"Variable selection in high-dimensional clustering analysis is an important yet challenging problem. In this paper, we propose two methods that simultaneously clustering data points and select important variables that contribute to the clustering. Our methods make use of the fact that parameters belonging to one variable should be treated as a natural "group", and tend to remove unimportant variables more effectively and provide better clustering results than the traditional L1-norm approach."
