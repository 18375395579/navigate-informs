2008"Conventional control charts may perform poorly when monitoring sequences with dynamic shift patterns. This paper proposes a new weighted cumulative sum (WCUSUM) procedure by first estimating the dynamic mean of the sequence then using the estimates for weighting the incremental in the conventional CUSUM chart. It is found that the WCUSUM chart performs far superior to other charts for detecting small to moderate shifts when forecast recovery is present."
