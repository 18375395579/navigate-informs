2006"This talk will discuss research related to an integrated Activity-Based/DTA model (CEMDAP and VISTA).  Given the disaggregate data on socio-demographics, activity-travel environment and prescribed policy actions for the base year, CEMDAP generates detailed activity-travel patterns for each individual in a population which serve as inputs for the integrated DTA model. Technical, computational, and practical issues involved in this demand-supply integration problem will be discussed."
