2013"Strategically locating emergency response facilities based on regional risk maps can reduce the impact of a disaster on communities. We model a general location-allocation problem for emergency response as a capacitated facility location problem under uncertainty. To solve the model, we use two-stage stochastic programming with side constraints to minimize the total expected cost and limit the downside risks. We illustrate our methodology using data from the city of Bogot?(Colombia)."
