2007"We consider methods for evaluating the progress of B&B algorithms. One main goal is to provide users with more useful information on the progress of the algorithm and the other is to develop a method to predict the total solution time.   A novel progress measure is computed and total solution time predictions are calculated based on that measure. Three open-source solvers, COIN/Cbc, Symphony, and Glpk are used to study B&B tree development for a number of different test problems."
