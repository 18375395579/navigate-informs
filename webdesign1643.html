2013"SREC market prices have been proven to be extremely volatile in the past few years. This has caused higher risk and less investment in solar power generation. We propose an original SREC price model, and provide a dynamic programming solution algorithm. Our model includes a feedback mechanism for generation response to market prices. Finally, after calibrating our model to reproduce historical prices, we analyse and propose alternative market mechanisms capable of improving market performance."
