2006"The aim of this presentation is to present a unified framework that integrates simultaneously the inventory and pricing sub-problems faced by airlines and high-speed rail companies. The framework is based on the bilevel programming paradigm where the behavior of passengers is implicitly considered with the use of choice models. According to the selected choice models, algorithmic issues will be discussed. Numerical results on real life instances will be presented."
