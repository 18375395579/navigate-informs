2006"Product designers often end up "reinventing the wheel" because they cannot find previous work that would aid in designing a new product. These challenges can be met by employing data mining methods on existing documents such as bills of material. We present a manufacturing case study using tree mining, tree union procedures, and constrained XML for information modeling. We also identify new research directions for data mining motivated by engineering design and information technology."
