2008"To increase the efficiency of text input on the increasingly powerful and ubiquitous hand-held devices, we have found near optimal layouts for letter positions on touch-screen keyboards using a Metropolis Monte Carlo Method.  The objective functions used in the simulations included a term that models the input speed for expert users and was based on empirically-determined letter pair frequencies from collections of sampled text.  Substantial text input speed improvements were obtained."
