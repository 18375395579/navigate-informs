2012"Calibrated building model is playing a more significant role in building retrofit and control but yet remains to be an art rather than a science due to the inherent nonlinearity and uncertainty in building behavior. This study presents a simple but effective Monte Carlo approach that delivers calibrated building models by a walk-through audit. A university building is used to demonstrate the strength and robustness of the approach to unavoidable noise/disturbance in building model calibration."
