2012"Pandemic simulations can be so high-dimensional that it is difficult for conventional designed experiments to explore the full space of possible disease parameters, population characteristics, and simulated pandemic responses. Stochastic kriging, an alternative simulation meta-modeling technique, is used to search the simulation design space for good pandemic control strategies and construct a response surface covering a range of possible future scenarios."
