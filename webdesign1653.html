2007"In this paper, we address the modelling of expected loss over multi-year horizons in internal models allowed by the New Basel Accord, using a joint specification of the probability of default and the loss given default. We estimate different models using an extensive default and recovery data set that contains the majority of defaults between 1980-2004 of AMEX, NYSE and NASDAQ listed companies, and undertake extensive out-of-sample performance tests."
