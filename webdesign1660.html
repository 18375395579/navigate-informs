" 1 - ****DELETE***11_5****SPC for Monitoring Nonlinear Profiles Using Wavelets and B-splines"
Shing Chang, Associate Professor, Kansas State University, Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Eng, changs@ksu.edu"
2007"A statistical process control framework is proposed to monitor nonlinear profiles. The proposed methodology aims at identifying mean shifts or the shape changes in a profile. Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) is applied to separate variation or noise from profile contours. A B-spline model is then used to further reduce problem dimension."
