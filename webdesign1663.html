2007"A Virtual Container Yard (VCY) is an Internet based information sharing platform, aiming at permitting direct empty container interchange and other processes to take place without moving the container back to the marine terminal or an empty container depot. This paper describes a modeling approach used in estimating benefits associated with the implementation of a VCY for various VCY operating scenarios. The microsimulation platform VISTA is used in this effort."
