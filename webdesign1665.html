2006"Data streaming applications are becoming popular due to the rapid development in sensor networks, multimedia streaming, and online data mining, etc. The incoming data streams often fluctuate at a finer time scale compared to the resource allocation decisions. We employ a multilevel resource allocation scheme to account for the different time scale and the randomness in the stream arrival rates. Stochastic programming approaches are presented to obtain the optimal resource allocation solutions."
