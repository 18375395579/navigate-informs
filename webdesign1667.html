2008"In this article, we use an evolutionary model to analyze how contracts are adjusted. We construct agent-based simulations in which firms face contractual problems. Building on this model, we examine how different levels of bounded rationality and adjustment costs influence the change of contracts. Furthermore, we investigate how the impacts of bounded rationality and adjustment costs are moderated by the complexity of contractual problems."
