2007"In this work we derive an expression for the residual life distribution of a linear degradation model with iid normal error and gamma distributed stochastic parameter, using Bayesian updating technique. We also propose a simulation based algorithm to estimate the residual life. Finally, we extend our application to monitoring the degree of stenosis in the Arterio-Venous access of hemodialysis patients, to predict the time of next intervention."
