2006"The successful commercialization of medical technologies requires informed decision-making and strategy-setting by manufacturers and investors at early stages of the innovation process. This paper presents a novel framework based on systems analysis and probabilistic methods that integrates both engineering-based assessment models and health-economic considerations. The case of a new orthopedic technology is used to demonstrate application of this framework."
