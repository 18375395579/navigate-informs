2012"We analyze the performance of several discretization methods, extending the work of Keefer and Bodily (1983) by expanding their analysis of discrete approximations of continuous probability distributions using the Pearson distribution system, and adding some additional commonly used methods. We also propose some three-point approximations tailored to specific distribution types."
