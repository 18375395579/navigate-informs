2008"Poor data quality and the lack of integration in data warehouse (DWH) make it difficult for business users to obtain a consistent view of business processes.   To monitor operational data feeding systems, this paper proposes a statistical model for  data feeding systems from heterogeneous databases to a central DWH. An online statistical process control (SPC) procedure is developed to identify  inconsistencies in the feeding data."
