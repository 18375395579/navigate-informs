2012"We empirically assess the operating efficiency of Internet retailers using stochastic non-smooth envelopment of data. In the first stage, we adopt concave nonparametric least squares (CNLS) to tackle estimation bias incurred by contextual variables. In the second stage, we decompose CNLS residuals and derive efficiency estimates. We conclude by discussing the methodological implications of contextual variables and the managerial implications of e-retail efficiency."
