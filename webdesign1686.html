2012"Using a two-stage least squares model, we build a macroeconomic model of supply and demand for US higher education. We find that credit factors (student loan amounts and household debt) are primary drivers of demand. Further, we construct a hazard-based model of student loan defaults to estimate default probabilities for different types of students. We account for frailty correlation due to unobserved factors, macroeconomic conditions, and individual student characteristics."
