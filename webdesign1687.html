2013"Information systems that make autonomous decisions based on consumers?preferences will play an important role in the smart retail electricity markets of the future. We present a computational preference model that learns unobtrusively from limited data and that quantifies the certainty of its own predictions as input to autonomous decision-making tasks. We evaluate our model on real-world tariff preference data collected through a commercial crowdsourcing platform."
