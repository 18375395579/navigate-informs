2013"Recent studies have pointed out that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data is a promising technique to explain the distributive working nature of the brain. However, the disparity between the number of features and available observations is made difficult to reach easy and meaningful results. In this work, mutual information based feature selection is applied to reduce scale of the problem. Experimental results for several classifiers are shown for different experimental settings."
