2006"Modeling experiments with qualitative and quantitative factors is an important but unsolved issue in computer modeling. Some Gaussian process models that can accomodate both qualitative and quantitative facotors are proposed. A real example for modeling the thermal distribution in a data center is used to illustrate the proposed models."
