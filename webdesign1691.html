2007"Hierarchical production models offer a means of better managing large and complex forest planning models dealing with forest-wide and landscape level detail. In this talk, Lagrangian relaxation is used to formulate a hierarchical model that maximizes the net present value of harvest incomes while recognizing specific geographical units that are subject to harvest flow and green-up constraints. The model is solved using a modified Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition/column generation routine."
