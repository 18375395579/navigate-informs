2013"As the urbanization rate increases everyday, city logistics become more and more important. Electric vehicles are both environmentally friendly and also less costly alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles.

We propose a new model that helps businesses to evaluate the contribution of electric vehicles in city logistics."
