2013"Recent advances in the development of new biomarker tests, which physicians use for the early detection of cancer, have the potential to improve patient survival and lower the cost of treatment by catching cancer at an early stage. An optimization model will be discussed for analyzing how to use prostate cancer biomarker tests during screening to maximize quality adjusted survival. Numerical results based on a large clinical dataset will be used to draw insights about optimal screening policies."
