2013"We study the Bariatric Program at Toronto Western Hospital. The program consists of multiple visits with care providers prior to surgery. Patient wait times and abandonment have been a concern of the hospital. We apply logistic regression and survival analysis to estimate the influence of patient covariates on system time and continued participation. Transition time distribution estimates support a patient flow simulation that is used to estimate required staffing levels and throughput goals."
