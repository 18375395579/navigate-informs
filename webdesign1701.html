2007"We incorporate the feature of a Hit-and-Run  based small world network model into Improving Hit-and-Run to  obtain a parameterized IHR algorithm. We adaptively tune a  parameter of this algorithm to enhance performance by maintaining  a constant probability of improvement using our analytically  derived lower and upper bounds."
