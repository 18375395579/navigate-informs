2012"This study seeks to quantify the benefits of real-time travel information in terms of both conventional travel time savings as well as psychological effects for individual travelers. Revealed preference (RP) data from an experiment with a driving simulator and stated preference (SP) data from a survey will be utilized in behavioral analysis to estimate the value of the real-time information."
