2012"Radiation therapists (RTs) are integral to cancer care, performing tasks such as imaging, treatment planning and delivery. We present a mixed integer programming model to create RT schedules with daily assignments. Results from implementation at a mid-size center in Western Canada show 30% to 40% improvement in a range of quality metrics. The model is packaged into a customized web-based scheduling platform and used by the RT manager on a regular basis."
