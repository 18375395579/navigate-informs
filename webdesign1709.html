2013"We develop a three-step method to consider the impact of structural controllability on designing systems. First, a method based on Decision Support Problem (DSP) is used to generate a set of system design alternatives. Second, a graph-theoretic method based on the cactus notion is proposed to find sufficient conditions for a system to be structurally controllable. Finally, cDSP is applied to design structural controllable systems."
