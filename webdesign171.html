2013"We develop reliability models for systems subject to dependent risks of degradation and random shocks with a degradation rate transition according to particular random shock patterns. The degradation rate can change when the system becomes more susceptible to fatigue and deteriorates faster, as a result of withstanding shocks. We consider four different shock patterns that can increase the degradation rate: (1) extreme shock model; (2) d-shock model; (3) m-shock model; and (4) run shock model."
