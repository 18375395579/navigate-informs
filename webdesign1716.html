2008"Spatially-explicit forest planning models can be extremely difficult to solve.  We look at one factor that is expected to contribute to the difficulty of solving these models: the relative size of management units compared to the maximum harvest opening size.  The study evaluates, in the context of actual harvest scheduling problems from the PA State Forests, the trade-off between better solution quality versus the added difficulty of solving problems with more, smaller management units."
