2006"Statistical analyses for time series or spatial data have been widely used to investigate the behavior of ambient air pollutants. The main objective of this study is to characterize the spatial correlation and the temporal pattern of PM2.5. Clustering analysis with correlation distance was performed to group the monitoring stations where the clustered stations have similar temporal patterns over the monitoring period. Moreover, the temporal patterns in each clustered region were investigated"
