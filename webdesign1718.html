2006"Real options analysis is used to value the flexibility provided by the option to perform preventive, condition-based maintenance in a manufacturing process outside of a strict age-based policy. Contingent claims analysis and option pricing theory are used to value these maintenance options in terms of expected cost savings. This research develops a methodology for properly valuing these options and incorporates the values into a model to determine the optimal maintenance policy."
