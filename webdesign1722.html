2007"Given the growing worldwide interest, the expected future cost of power plants with CO2 capture is of significant interest. This study uses historical experience curves as the basis for estimating future cost trends for four types of electric power plants with CO2 capture systems. We estimate future cost reductions that might be achieved by power plants employing CO2 capture. Effects of uncertainties in key parameters are evaluated via sensitivity analysis."
