2013"Motivated by wind energy applications, we present a partially-observed Markov decision process model for optimally replacing a component that operates and degrades in a partially-observable random environment. The first of two models assumes that replacement costs are fixed, while the second model considers costs that depend on the environment’s state during the replacement interval. We show that control-limit policies are optimal in both cases and illustrate them using numerical examples."
