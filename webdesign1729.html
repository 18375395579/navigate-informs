2008"In this paper we study the impact of the on-line channel (e.g. Internet banking) on the capacity expansion of a firm’s existing off-line channel (e.g. bank branches) with both analytical modeling and empirical study. We first present a dual-channel spatial model and then we test a series of hypotheses regarding service capacity expansion based on the model and related literature. The empirical study finds strong support for the proposed model and mixed results of the alternative explanations."
