2007"We propose a competitive model, based on online retailers?differentiation, to explain price dispersion. We empirically test the predictions of this model and find that the model is a viable alternative to the hedonic price model. In addition, our competitive model is able to predict and explain observations that are seemingly inconsistent with a hedonic model."
