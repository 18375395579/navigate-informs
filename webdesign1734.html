2012"Understanding nanostructure growth faces issues of limited data, lack of physical knowledge, and large process uncertainties. These issues result in modeling difficulty because a large pool of candidate models almost fit the data equally well. In this talk, we present a new cross-domain model building and validation approach to address these challenges for scalable nanomanufacturing."
