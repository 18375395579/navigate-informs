2008"The security companies in Taiwan develop a new way of survival using their logistic capability. A mathematical model is developed for the vehicle routings service combined with security service. The objective of this model is to minimize the number of vehicle as well as the traveling cost. A heuristic algorithm using a typical searching technique is developed for solving the problem. The profitability of this proposed model and the effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithm are tested."
