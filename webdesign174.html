2012"In the context of a scheduled fixed-route transit service, we explore a more realistic passenger assignment using an integrated traffic and transit simulation tool to generate transit vehicle trajectories. Using these trajectories, we assign transit passengers to the network using either a trip-based shortest path or a trip-based hyperpath assignment. The simulation model and the associated transit assignment methods are illustrated on a case study from Sacramento, California."
