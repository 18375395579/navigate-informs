2012"One way to anticipate terrorists?malicious actions is to consider their values when modeling their decisions - such values will drive their choices. Using multi-attribute utility theory we suggest modeling dynamic preferences of a malicious agent by incorporating state-dependent weights to account for preference change caused by exogenous triggers and representing the environment as a system dynamics model. We explore its use in the context of counter-terrorism analysis."
