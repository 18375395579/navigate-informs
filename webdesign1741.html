2008"Research has established a curvilinear relationship between team communication and performance. We extend this research by employing a technique, using empirical data as a basis, to simulate teams.  These simulated teams communicate via three different media and are completing projects of varying complexity.  Our results have important implications for practice as they indicate the optimal communication levels where these teams achieve their best performance"
