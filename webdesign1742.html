2012"We present a new method to explore multi-attribute utility functions when the decision maker's preferences are incompletely specified. We consider the multi-linear utility function and use a new simulation procedure called JDSIM to perform sensitivity analysis over the space of all possible utilities that match partially specified preferences. Finally, we present a case of study and illustrate the power of this procedure under relative elicitation."
