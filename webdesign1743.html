2012"We propose a generic mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for investment and operations planning of a multiple Oil and Gas field site under complex fiscal rules that are defined by the contract with the host government. The model can be reduced to a variety of specific contracts. We show an improvement in the decisions using this model as compared to a simple NPV based approach. Solution strategies based on reformulation/approximations are proposed to solve the problem efficiently."
