2008"We provide a framework for integrating two stages of Radiation Treatment Planning (RTP): Beam Angle Selection (BAS) and Dose Optimization (DO). Alternative BAS and DO algorithms or commercial RTP software and clinical experience can be embedded within the framework. Automated BAS and improved dose distribution are achieved within the framework. Computational efficiency is achieved by utilizing High-Throughput Computing (HTC) via the Condor system."
