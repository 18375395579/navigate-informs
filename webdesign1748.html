2012"We present a data-driven approach for designing new clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy treatments. Our approach combines (i) text-mining to develop a database of existing trial results, (ii) statistical modeling to predict outcomes of new drug combinations, and (iii) optimization models to select novel treatments that strike a balance between maximizing patient outcomes (exploitation) and learning new things about treatments that may be useful in the future (exploration)."
