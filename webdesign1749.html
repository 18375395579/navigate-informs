2012"In addition to using patient acuity measures, this work considers incorporating travel distances into the construction of a nurse’s patient assignments based on the use of unit-derived workload scores and distance scores. It is shown that the conic scalarization approach can be successfully used for solving these multi-objective nurse-to-patient assignment problems."
