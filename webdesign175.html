2012"A discrete choice model was used to infer airline flight cancellation preferences from a sample of on-time performance flight data. The predicted cancellation probabilities were then used as inputs to delay savings estimates, which were approximated with a continuous technique. The results from this work will be useful for incorporating flight cancellation decisions into system-wide delay forecasting models."
