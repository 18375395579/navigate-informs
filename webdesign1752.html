2013"The regularized random forest (RRF) is a collection of trees that avoid using a new feature for splitting a node if its information gain is not significantly greater than the features used in previous nodes. Consequently, an RRF for supervised learning can be used to select a compact subset of features. There are some limitations that can occur when there are a large number of features and few instances at a node (node sparsity issue). A further modified RRF is presented for this case."
