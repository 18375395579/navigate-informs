2007"This research recognizes that, in many decision environments in which revenue optimization is attempted, an actual demand curve is generally unobservable. We describe the dynamics of demand as an evolutionary differential equation. The resulting model takes the form of a differential variational inequality (DVI). We then observe realized sales data to obtain estimates of parameters that govern the evolution of demand. We present an algorithm for solving the DVI based on a gap function."
