2012"The Deployable Exercise System II (DEXES-II) is a new social model being developed by Dr. Loren Cobb for USSOUTHCOM. I describe the validation of the DEXES-II conceptual model with The DIME/PMESII VV&A Tool, which uses the Total Irregular Warfare Ontology as the basis for linking the model to the social theories supporting the model.  I describe both the process and the results."
