2007"We consider policy evaluation algorithms for infinite horizon dynamic programming problems with discounted cost. The focus is on discrete time dynamic systems with a large number of states. We discuss methods for policy evaluation that use temporal diffrences and function approximations. The methods update parameters of the function approximation on-line incrementally   based on observations of system states from an infinite trajectory."
