2007"The optimal sample size allocation in a multi-group life-testing experiment with complete or Type-II censored samples when the extreme value regression model is used for statistical analysis will be discussed. We will derive the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs), expected Fisher information and the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of the MLEs. Three optimality criteria and different settings will be introduced and some numerical results of the optimality allocations will be presented."
