2012"Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) is an important segment of an aircraft under the new NextGen air traffic system. We present a new formulation for the problem in order to minimize fuel consumption, emissions, noise and delays subject to assignment and separation constraints. We evaluate different CDA approaches, i.e. non/some/all aircrafts are CDA equipped. Computational results using real data show the efficiency of the modeling and the potential benefits of the CDA implementation."
