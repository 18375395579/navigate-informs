2008"A new approximation to the Multivariate Marshall-Olkin Model for common cause failure is presented. The model aggregates component failures due to outside shocks into ordered modes, where each mode is composed of all possible failure combinations of a given number of components. The model is analyzed in a Bayesian framework and  results of the new model are produced for a three component system using simulated data."
