2013"Estimating dispersion matrices is a fundamental step for many applications, but classical sample covariance estimates are very sensitive to outliers. We propose a new robust covariance estimator using the regular vine structure and robust partial correlation estimators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such estimator in the active asset allocation application."
