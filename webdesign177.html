2012"We propose an approach to counterfactual analysis of securities exchanges that can be applied to predict the impact of proposed regulatory changes.  We conduct an empirical case study in which we predict the impact of a historical tick size change on exchange efficiency and compare predictions to what can be inferred from subsequent data."
