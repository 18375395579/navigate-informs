2006"The simulation model, based on the OOP paradigm, uses a fixed time step of one day, and adapts the management decisions obtained from a longer scope model to a daily use. It can model generating and pumping units and canals. We propose a three pass algorithm in order to reduce spillages to a minimum. This algorithm determines the hydro production of every reservoir including pumping scheduling decisions, to reach this objective. Numerical results from a real basin from Spain are presented."
