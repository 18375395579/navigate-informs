2008"We describe a model that optimizes the allocation of energy from different sources to different types of demand on an hourly time scale, while deciding how much of different types of energy capacity should be  added over a multi-decade horizon.  A deterministic version of an aggregate model produces a linear program with millions of variables.  We present an approximate dynamic programming model that closely matches optimal on deterministic problems while handling multiple forms of uncertainty."
