2012"This study uses economic I-O models for static resilience planning in interdependent sectors and data and events for planning are uncertain. We answer: How can shock impact be minimized to restore economic equilibrium? What is the nature of problem uncertainties? Can we guarantee solutions are robust to uncertainties? We combine robust optimization and risk I-O models for a robust static resilience planning problem to provide worst-case planning and risk scenarios in resilience decision-making."
