2012"We propose a novel use of DEA cross-efficiency evaluation in portfolio selection. In addition to average cross-efficiency scores, we suggest to examine the variations of cross-efficiencies, and to incorporate the two statistics of cross-efficiencies into the mean-variance formulation of portfolio selection. Two benefits can be attained by this approach; selection of robust portfolios and alleviation of the so-called “ganging together?phenomenon of DEA cross-efficiency evaluation."
