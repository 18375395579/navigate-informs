2013"Planning methods in hospitals rely on accurate estimation of patient flow for census predictions. We propose a hybrid clustering-classification prediction model for better estimation of patient flow. Semi-Markov model-based clustering is developed to cluster a heterogeneous mix of patients into homogeneous groups of patients with similar flow patterns. The clustering model is then linked with a classifier to predict the patient flow based on patient attributes."
