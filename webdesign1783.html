2008"Data mining meta-optimization usually involves evaluating a series of configurations for many algorithms. Since each configuration can be evaluated independently, the data mining meta-optimization problem can be solved using distributed computing. We developed an agent-based, distributed computation engine to power the meta-optimization. This engine can significantly reduce computational time."
