2013"There is growing interest in the use of grid-level storage to smooth variations in the loads that are likely to arise with increased use of wind and solar energy. Battery arbitrage is becoming an important way of paying for investments into grid level storage. We formulate the problem using the dynamic programming framework, show several structural properties of the optimal value functions, and apply the techniques of approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to find a profitable bidding policy."
