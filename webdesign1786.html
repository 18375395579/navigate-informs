2012"Optimal separation in continuous descent arrivals (CDA) refers to the use of spacing policies that are shown to be optimal based on stochastic dynamic models. These models involve optimization of different objective structures defined as functions of runway utilization and airline operating costs. Considering some potentially implementable objective structures, we derive both analytical and numerical results that quantify the environmental value of using optimal separation policies in CDA."
