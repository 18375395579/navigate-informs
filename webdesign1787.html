2006"A majority of the oligopolistic energy market models focus on obtaining equilibria for single period (one shot) games with constant demand. We develop a multi-period model capable of incorporating stochastic demand variations, and a simulation & learning based solution approach. A multi period equilibrium solution is developed for a sample network for which a single period game solution is available in literature. The solutions are compared for various numerical scenarios."
