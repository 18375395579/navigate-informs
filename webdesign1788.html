2012"We summarize the results of a comprehensive experimental performance comparison of some recent procedures for solving the simulation start-up problem, including the methods incorporated in MSER-5, N-Skart, WASSP, and SBatch.  Substantial differences in performance are observed, especially in comparisons of MSER-5 with  the latter three procedures."
