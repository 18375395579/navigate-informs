2006"We consider large-scale, network-based resource allocation problems under uncertainty. By modeling data uncertainties in service time, resource availability, supplies and demands, we generate more robust solutions, that is, solutions that are more likely to be executed or easier to repair when disrupted. We solve our model using a new decomposition scheme, geared specifically for large-scale problems and evaluate our approach using data provided by a large-scale carrier."
