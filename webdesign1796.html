2008"We demonstrate how text information from news articles can be used to predict intra-day price movements on equities using support vector machines.  This is a classic text classification problem where labels describe price movements following the release of news.  Furthermore, we use recent advances in large-scale kernel learning to combine equity returns as predictive features with text in order to increase predictability."
