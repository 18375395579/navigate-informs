2013"In recent years, with the overall increase in data availability there is a growing need for new monitoring techniques that can cope with such data complexity. For this purpose, we suggest a new statistical process control (SPC) approach for data-rich environments. The proposed approach is based on the theory of fractal geometry.The fractal model can be used for anomaly detection, pattern analysis and knowledge discovery."
