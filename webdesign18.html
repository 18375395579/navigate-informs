2013"Antiretroviral treatment(ART) for HIV dramatically improves the life expectancy of those infected and reduces the risk of transmission, but achieving those results requires that people with HIV stay in care and on treatment. We examine the effect and cost-effectiveness of strategies to promote retention in care and adherence to medications using the Progression and Transmission of HIV/AIDS (PATH) model, an agent-based simulation model that tracks individual disease progression and transmissions."
