2013"This demo will concentrate on how AIMMS can help you solve complicated optimization models using prebuilt building blocks to meet customized requirements. We will demonstrate the AIMMS?Benders Decomposition library for large MIP models and AIMMS?Outer Approximation algorithm for MINLP models. We will also show you how to use the “straight out of the box?tools. These advanced algorithms in AIMMS will give you the power and flexibility to tackle the most complicated problems.
