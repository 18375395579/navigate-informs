2007"In this data mining application case study, we help PetPlan to model the demographics of their most desirable customers. We obtain and integrate relevant publicly accessible data, including US census data, and veterinary location data. We use a traditional entropy-based decision tree algorithm, and a novel profit-based algorithm. We evaluate the results in terms of statistical significance, accuracy, profitability, and robustness, and make recommendations for PetPlan's marketing strategy."
