2013"Counterparty risk depends on the interaction between market and credit risk. Positive dependence between the two creates “wrong-way risk? The dependence between market and credit risk is difficult to model, so we develop methods for bounding it by finding the worst-case joint distribution given constraints on the marginal models of market and credit risk. We also develop a method to interpolate between the worst case and the independent case based on the degree of uncertainty in the dependence."
