2007"Logistics planners must ensure the USAF, Army, Navy supply requirements are met while contending with  numerous transportation and operational constraints.  Using COTS software, SAS consultants developed a logistics optimization prototype called GOLDSS.  By linking existing DoD legacy systems, into a new optimization model , an interactive interface was designed to support strategist planners as they analyze and evaluate the results of the optimization model."
