2007"We consider large-scale, network-based resource allocation problems under uncertainty. By proactively modeling data uncertainty, we generate plans which are robust operationally. We propose in this work a decomposition modeling and algorithmic framework that improves solution tractability for deterministic problems and, in addition, models uncertainty. As proof-of-concept, we apply our approach to an airline scheduling problem and evaluate its performance using data from a large carrier."
