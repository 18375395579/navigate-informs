2007"Systems biology is steeped in network optimization because it is natural to model cell behavior in terms of an optimal state. However, many in the area often define constructs in terms of the solution, as if it was unique.  Initial investigations show this is flawed, and we will discuss the role of degeneracy and offer an alternative perspective.  This aids the current frontier of the discipline that is based in parametric and sensitivity analysis."
