2008"Seasonal flu epidemics caused by antigenic drifts and the high rate of influenza transmission require annual updates in the flu shot composition. The World Health Organization recommends which strains of influenza to include in each year’s vaccine based on surveillance data and epidemiological analysis. We propose a class of multi–stage stochastic mixed-integer programming models addressing the optimal design of the annual flu shot in terms of timing and composition."
