2007"We develop a model for the problem of designing habitat reserve areas to support endangered species. For the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO), we model the occupancy of a patch of land by a 0-1 variable. We develop a function called the Habitat Connectivity Index (HCI), which measures the overall  suitability of a habitat to sustain the owls. The decisions of which patch is to be sustained and which cleared from among candidate ones is modeled as a non-linear integer program that maximizes HCI."
