2007"We propose a jump diffusion model with jump sizes having a  hyper-exponential distribution. This model provides a link between asset pricing models with exponential tails and power tails, and leads to analytical solutions for lookback, barrier and perpetual American options. This is made possible by using martingale methods to study some multi-dimensional integro-differential equations, and by solving related first passage time problems and optimal stopping problems."
