2008"We study the potential for health IT to increase healthcare resource allocation efficiency. In particular, we model hospital’s surgical scheduling software demand. We develop a theoretical software demand. We test this model using IT investment and surgical service data from about 3000 hospitals. Using revealed preference techniques, we find that scheduling software demand is increasing in service scope and is used to enhance surgical service efficiency."
