2007"Advance warning signs are a common type of temporary traffic control device to alert motorists of upcoming roadway disturbances.  This paper discusses the possibility to improve work zone throughput through a careful selection of location of the first warning sign.  A stochastic model was developed to for this purpose.  Calibrated using simulated data, the model has shown to be effective in determining the placement of the first warning sign under various work zone entry traffic volumes."
