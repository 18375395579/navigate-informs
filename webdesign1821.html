2013"We develop a continuous state, discrete time Markov Decision Process model to optimize downstream purification processes in a biomanufacturing facility. The model combines the physical characteristics of chromatography (column dimensions, resin binding capabilities) along with process reliability (yields, failures, and constraints on purity levels) to determine optimal policies."
