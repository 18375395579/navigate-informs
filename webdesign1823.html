2013"Movable storage shelves (pods) that can be lifted and brought to the order-pick station by robotic vehicles can improve flexibility and productivity in picking activities. Closed queuing network models provide a rich framework for rapidly evaluating the throughput performance of such systems with alternate pick-area, vehicle sharing, and pod storage strategies."
