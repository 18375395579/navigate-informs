2012"Understanding a disturbance like a fire on forest landscapes is a challenge because of complex interactions over a range of temporal and spatial scales. We present a stochastic, cellular multi-objective forest harvest scheduling model incorporating a mechanistic model of fire risk probability based on the state of a cell and the fire risk in neighboring cells."
