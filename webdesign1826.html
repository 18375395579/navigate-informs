2012"We present two partially-observed Markov decision process (POMDP) models for replacing a wind-turbine component based on observability of a stochastic operating environment. Component degradation is environment-driven and continuous. The POMDP models are solved using belief-projection, and numerical experiments suggest the existence of optimal threshold-type policies with respect to cumulative degradation."
