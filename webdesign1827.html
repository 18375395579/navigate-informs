2007"This paper describes an intermediate term planning model for valuing wind   power generation in a well-balanced hydro-thermal system with a Poolco kind   of market. Traditional approaches have used displacement cost or market   price. Using the market models we describe alternative approaches based on   the properties of the market and illustrate their usefulness through an MPEC   model of an "Ontario-like" system."
