2006"The preliminary results of a project between the University of Alabama, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the SAS Institute are presented. This project examined text mining applied to medical records. The data were clinical notes; particularly, notes from pathology, radiology and discharge summaries. Using this data, we constructed a start list using the medication list from RxNorm and SNOMED CT(r). We then developed several predictive models."
