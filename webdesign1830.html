2008"We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of HIV epidemic in far western Nepal. For specific conditions, we calculate the basic reproduction number, disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium. Our model analysis and simulation results suggest that returning-migrants group from India have to be targeted for developing preventive programs. We also formulate an optimal control problem and provide a better strategy based on the results of our model."
