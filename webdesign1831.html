2013"Demand response is the capability of load to react to short-term changes in electricity prices. As electricity markets become deregulated, it plays an increasingly important role. We present a long-term power generation expansion planning model with a short-term demand response function in its general form, and introduce a Benders Decomposition approach to solve it efficiently. We discuss possible extensions to the model and compare implementation options in GAMS."
