2008"As infectious diseases are controlled by interrupting transmission of pathogens among hosts, reliable model-based evaluations of alternative strategies depend on faithful representations of heterogeneity in inter-personal contacts. Opportunities for validation are rare in public health, but population models in which mixing is a convex combination of age-specific activities and preferences reproduce historical observations."
