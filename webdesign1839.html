2007"This research develops and validates a novel data-integrated simulation to evaluate nurse-patient assignments (SIMNA) based on a real data set provided by Baylor Regional Medical Center (Baylor) in Grapevine, Texas. Data mining methods were utilized to extract important knowledge from the data for the simulation. A simulation-based optimization technique was developed to assign the incoming patient during a given shift."
