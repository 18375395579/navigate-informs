2007"We construct a simultaneous equations model to interrelate sales, inventory, and gross margin for a retailer at the firm level. Using public financial data, we estimate 6 causal effects among these variables. Our model yields insights about these effects that support theoretical literature. It also provides sales forecasts, which in our numerical tests, are more accurate than forecasts from time-series models that ignore inventory and gross margin as well as those from equity analysts."
