2007"Over 50 percent of travel time delays are accountable to non-recurrent congestion such as incidents.  Despite its importance, state-of-the-art dynamic routing algorithms assume away the effect of these incidents on travel time. We propose alternative models to estimate incident induced delays which can be integrated with dynamic routing algorithms. These models use real-time information from various ITS sources, such as loop-sensors."
