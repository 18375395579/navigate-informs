Pentagon decision makers can create, change, and compare optimization scenarios in a point-and-click environment. This optimization model runs on the newest solvers available in SAS/OR? and can be deployed as a BI environment via an easy to use interface so military planners can explore results with embedded GIS capabilities and OLAP cubes."
