2008"A statistical process control framework is proposed to monitor nonlinear profiles. The proposed methodology identifies mean shifts or “shape changes?in a profile. Discrete wavelet transformation is applied to separate variation or noise from profile contours. B-splines are adopted to generate critical points to define the shape of a profile."
