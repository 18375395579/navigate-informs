2006"This paper develops a framework which merges annuity purchase decisions with consumption-investment selections in retirement planning. A multi-period wealth evolution model is constructed based on an annuity pricing model, a benefit payment model, and an income model. An optimization problem is formulated with an objective of maximizing life time utility of consumption and wealth."
