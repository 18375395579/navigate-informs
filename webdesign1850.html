2007"A hierarchical Petri net (PN) approach is taken to model a multi-echelon Supply Chain (SC) using a modular approach for the process steps and performance measures. Our modeling is extracted from the SCOR 8.0 model. Strategic and operational policies are considered dynamic. In response to a disruption, these policies are optimized and enforced on the system as dynamic constraints. These constraints, combined with the place invariants of the PN, yield a supervisory net for control of the SC."
