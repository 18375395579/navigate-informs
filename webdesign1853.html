2013"Decisions often need to be made with incomplete knowledge about some parameters of the problem. While formulating a stochastic model that captures accurately this knowledge can be a costly task, solving a stochastic program simply based on historical data can provide useful guidance. Unfortunately, one might worry of being misled by such a simplistic view. In this work, we propose tractable methods for bounding the improvements that could be achieved with a more accurate/expensive model."
