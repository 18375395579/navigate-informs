2008"This paper addresses an on-going effort of developing a supply chain modeling tool that combines optimization and simulation. Two different versions of the optimization module are developed, one using Xpress-Mosel and the other one using the open source software GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit). This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using a commercial solver such as Xpress-Mosel and an open source solver such as GLPK.  It also discusses modeling and execution issues."
