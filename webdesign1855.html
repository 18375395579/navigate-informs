2013"We use a discrete event simulation model to analyze the performance of a reservation-based car sharing system that allows one-way journeys.  The model appears to be unique in the literature in that it (1) explicitly models the state of the online reservation system in continuous time; (2) provides a full animation of car pick-ups, journeys, and drop-offs; and (3) explicitly includes the rental of extra parking time at a car’s pick-up and drop-off location in the car reservation process."
