" 1 - Simulation-based Intruder Detection Analysis"
Jeff Smith, Professor, Auburn University, 207 Dunstan Hall, Auburn University, AL, 36849, United States, jsmith@auburn.edu"
2007"This talk describes a general methodology and associated tools for assessing a fixed-site facility’s susceptibility to breach by one or more intruders.  The methodology is based on a discrete-event simulation system that models the facility and its sensor network along with the intruders and their strategies for breaching the facility."
