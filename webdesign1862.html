2006"We present the theoretical development and implementation of a spatially and temporally scalable DTA (STS-DTA) model.  The STS-DTA model utilizes a cluster-computing methodology that enables flexible scaling of the network.  The Anisotropic Mesoscopic Simulation (AMS) model provides temporal scalability in traffic simulation resolution. Model semantics and research issues are discussed."
