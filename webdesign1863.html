2012"We present a model for product assortment optimization for a network of retail stores operating in various locations. We combine local information captured from each retail store and deploy a global frequent itemset analysis based on association rule mining. We solve a network optimization model to find which products to include in a store’s assortment and which stores to ship from. We use the transactional level data from a leading plastics manufacturer and retailer in the United States."
