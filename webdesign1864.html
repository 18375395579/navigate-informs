2013"We present a probabilistically constrained stochastic integer program model for wildfire initial response planning that incorporates both wildfire risk and the decision-maker’s risk averseness. The model uses wildfire risk indices based on the Texas Wildfire Risk Assessment system. We report on the application of the model to one of the Texas A&M Forest Service fire planning units in East Texas."
