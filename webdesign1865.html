2008"Routine HIV screening has been shown to be cost-effective in a variety of settings and is now recommended by the CDC. However, these studies typically ignore resource constraints at an organizational level that can impede implementation. We formulate a dynamic optimization model combining a disease progression model with a patient flow model under constrained resources. We apply this model to a VA facility and demonstrate the impact of resource constraints on the optimal screening policy."
