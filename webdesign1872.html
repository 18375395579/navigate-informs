2008"SPC methods can be applied to monitor the timeliness and correctness of the movement of physical or virtual entities through a process.  Comparison of process execution statistical monitoring methods with each other, or with traditional process execution management rules, can require sophisticated discrete-event simulation models.  We discuss the practical issues in building and using simulation models to study process execution monitoring schemes."
