2012"Kenya is largely hydro-based, but has a growing interest in wind energy to meet the growing demand for electricity. Our objective is to develop an optimal control strategy to deploy paired wind and hydro resources to maximize generation reliability in the Kenyan power system. The benefits of this methodology will be illustrated using a case study based on Kenyan wind data"
