2007"A simulation-based methodology is proposed to map the  mean of steady-state cycle time as a function of throughput  and product mix for manufacturing systems. Nonlinear regression  models motivated by queueing analysis are assumed  for the underlying response surface. To insure efficiency and  control estimation error, simulation experiments are built  up sequentially using a multistage procedure to collect data  for the fitting of the models."
