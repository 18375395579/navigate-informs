2008"Biosurveillance monitors daily health series data, aiming to find early indicators of disease outbreak and alert appropriate health officials.  To do this, most modern systems use forecasting to predict the health series' expected value, then monitor residuals from that prediction to provide detection.  This talk quantifies the relationship between improved forecasting and increased detection.  It also examines cases when improved forecasting does not necessarily improve detection."
