2012"Investing in infrastructure and industry sectors can lessen the direct impacts of disruptive events, and an input-output model can demonstrate how those direct impacts propagate to other economic sectors. We develop a model where the decision maker allocates resources to prepare for a disruption and to help individual industries recover if the disruption occurs. These models are applied to a case study to analyze the economic impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill."
