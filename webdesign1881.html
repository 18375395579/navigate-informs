2007"Contrary to the expectations of physicians, patients and regulators, methodologies for making useful risk and benefit tradeoffs continue to be the subject of intense debate.  We have developed a multiattribute model designed to highlight and quantify the relative merits and deficits of treatment alternatives in well-defined and specific contexts, and advocate the usefulness of the model in providing a common, transparent platform for informed and focused discussion among stakeholders."
