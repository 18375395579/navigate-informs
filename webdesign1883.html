2012"Sequential design strategies allow experimenters to collect data only until prediction precision is sufficient.  We present a batch sequential experiment design algorithm that is based on sliced Full Factorial-Based Latin Hypercube Designs, an extension OA-based LHDs. The structure of the FF-based LHD produces good projectivity and orthogonality throughout the stages of the design. We then demonstrate the sampling and fitting properties through both empirical studies and theoretical arguments."
