2012"A robust decision-making framework is built on a general utility set which characterizes a decision maker's risk attitude described by certain boundary and auxiliary conditions. This framework is studied using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) approach.  We shows the asymptomatic convergence and give a mixed-integer reformulation. An application of this framework is illustrated using a portfolio investment decision problem."
