2008"In order to develop a simple, scalable and cost-effective technique for controlling Zinc nanorod array growth density, layer-by-layer polymer thin films were used in a wet chemical growth process. The objective was to fit a model connecting the thickness of polymer films to the observed density of nanorods. A physical-statistical model fitted with the experimental data helped in better understanding of the underlying growth mechanism."
