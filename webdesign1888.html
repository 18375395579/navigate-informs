2007"We specify and estimate adaptive route choice models that explicitly capture travelers route choice adjustments according to real-time information in a stochastic time-dependent network. Two types of adaptive route choice models are studied: a sequence of path choice models at every intermediate decision node;  and a routing policy choice model where the alternatives correspond to decision rules at the origin rather than simple paths. The models are estimated based on a Swedish GPS data set."
