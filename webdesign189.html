2012"Optimization of a computationally expensive black-box reservoir simulation model of many variables is demonstrated using an adaptive radial basis function method. The iterative proxy-based scheme is used to tune the control variables, distributed for finer control over a varying number of intervals covering the total simulation period, to maximize asset NPV. The method shows that large-scale simulation-based function optimization of several hundred variables is practical and effective."
