2008"Experimentation using computer codes to simulate physical processes  is used in many research fields.  Such codes often have many inputs and are cpu intensive.  We propose a two-stage group screening procedure to identifying active inputs.  Stage 1 partitions the inputs into groups and identifies an output for each group; the it identifies active groups using main effect and total sensitivity indices.  Stage 2 identifies active inputs from the individual inputs that comprise the active groups."
