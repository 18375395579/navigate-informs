2013"In this paper, we extend our previously proposed optimal hedging technique to path-dependent basket options using arbitrarily smooth payoff functions of individual options. We show that the sum of individual option values takes an optimal trajectory to minimize the mean square error under the risk neutral measure. We apply our methodology to the first passage time structural model, where a company with default risk possesses multiple projects/assets, and evaluate its individual equity values."
