2008"Most simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models are limited spatially and temporally due to computational resource requirements. The concept of rolling epoch is introduced to perform temporally scalable DTA modeling procedure. Model developments and numerical results are presented and discussed in this talk."
