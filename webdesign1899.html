2008"We simulate the effects of extending select provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax acts by integrating a microsimulation model of the federal individual income tax with a US macroeconomic model. We first calibrate both models to a common baseline forecast. We then iterate between the models so that both are calibrated to an alternative forecast that includes the effects of tax cut extensions on incomes. This income-adjusted forecast is used to estimate economic, revenue and distributional outcomes."
