2008"In response to long waiting times for residential care placements, we collaborated with the Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA) to develop an approach for forecasting complex care and assisted living requirements to year 2020. Arrival rates derived from demographic analysis coupled with length of stay estimates derived from censored data models provided inputs into a spreadsheet based planning model.  Results of this study impact both resource planning and resource allocation decisions."
