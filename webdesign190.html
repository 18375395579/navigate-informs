2007"This paper presents a wavelet-based multiresolution approach to  freeway incident detection based on traffic sensor measurements such as traffic flow, speed, and occupancy. Comparisons of results from incident detection experiments using actual traffic data from California in 2007 suggest that the proposed multiresolution approach to be superior to other popular methods. The paper also presents the possible applications of the  proposed approach to other problems in novelty detection area."
