2012"We formulate dependence in terms of the utility of predicting a variable from other variables. This approach integrates ideas from classic literature on dependence, the Bayesian expected utility in terms of uncertainty reduction, and measuring departure of a dependent model from the independence. We present applications to lifetime models such as Bayesian predictive joint distribution of components of a system and shock models, and Bayesian test of equality of parameters of lifetime models."
