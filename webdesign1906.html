2013"B-splines are commonly used in the Computer Aided Design (CAD) and signal processing to fit complicated functions. However, how to place the knots appropriately in B-spline curve fitting remains a difficult problem. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage knots placement method to place knots adapting to the curvature structures of the unknown function. We demonstrated the effectiveness using numerical studies on multiple representative functions."
