2013"We study a call center for which the total call volume consists of fresh calls, redials (re-attempts after abandonments) and reconnects (re-attempts after answered calls). We propose a model to estimate the redial and reconnect probabilities and the fresh call volume for call center data without customer identity information. We validate our estimation results via real call center and simulated data."
