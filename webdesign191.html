2007"In their 2006 Psychological Review paper, Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, and Hertwig propose the Priority Heuristic, a model of decision making over paired prospects.  They compare the Priority Heuristic to several models of decision making (e.g. Cumulative Prospect Theory).  We discuss several problems with their method and propose an alternate framework to compare decision models."
