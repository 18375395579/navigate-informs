2006"GAMS is grid-enabled, i.e. independent solver jobs run in parallel with the results collected as they become available, allowing the user to take advantage of cheap and powerful computational grids with no programming effort.  We demonstrate this by partitioning a MIP model for solution on a grid.  Using the GAMS performance analysis tools (www.gamsworld.org/performance) we measure the importance of the parameters involved (e.g. partitioning algorithm, MIP solver, grid nodes used)."
