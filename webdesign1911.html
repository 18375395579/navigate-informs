2006"The cardiovascular system provides oxygen/nutrients to the body. Tissue ischemia, due to obstruction of arterial blood flow, can result in serious effects (vision/limb loss). Development of new vessels can fuel the progression of cancer and macular degeneration. We present a pattern recognition algorithm and an optimization-based predictive model to analyze artery patterns. We illustrate its use for disease diagnosis/monitoring via classification of healthy vs diseased microvascular networks."
