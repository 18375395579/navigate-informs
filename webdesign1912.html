2006"We use local fuzzy models to determine remaining life for each vehicle in a fleet. We identify clusters of peers, similar units with comparable use and performance, and create a local fuzzy model per cluster. We combine this approach for model generation with evolutionary search for model maintenance. We generate competing models, evaluate them with actual data, refine them with evolutionary search, and select the best one. We repeat this process periodically to produce updated models."
