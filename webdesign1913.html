2007"Computer simulations are key tools for course-of-action and materiel development analyses. Extensive work has been conducted in behavioral science to determine what physiological and psychological factors drive human action, but this information is often overlooked in simulations. This paper describes a methodology for enhancing synthetic humans with personality-based attributes for simulations where high-risk and high-threat environments make human performance assessment difficult."
