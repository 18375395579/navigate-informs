2013"Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems provide medical care to emergency patients. Jointly optimizing location and dispatching decisions can improve equitability measures in EMS systems.  However, existing methods are not scalable.  We incorporate linear approximations to the hypercube model and allow for multiple vehicles at a station.  We developed a hybrid method which uses tabu-search with a non-deterministic tabu-list.  The model is tested on two real world data sets."
