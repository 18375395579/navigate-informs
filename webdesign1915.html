2013"Real-world dynamical systems often exhibit complex spiral wave dynamics and turbulent patterns. Many previous investigations focused on such space-time patterns on the regular 2D surfaces. This paper presents a dimensionality reduction approach for modeling nonlinear reaction-diffusion mechanisms in high-dimensional systems. This present investigation shows great potentials for characterizing and quantifying space-time dynamics in high-dimensional systems."
