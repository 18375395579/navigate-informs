2013"Forest and wildland fire managers seek to find fires while they are small to increase the chance that should a fire pose a threat, it will be contained by the initial attack system while still small, to minimize its destructive impact. We describe how we combined real-time GPS aircraft tracking data and the estimated ignition times of lightning-caused forest fires to estimate fire detection probabilities and how those detection probabilities can be used to help route aerial detection patrols."
