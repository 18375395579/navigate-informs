2013"There are several simulation tools available for analyzing rail capacity utilization. This research uses two common simulation tools developed in the U.S. and Europe, Rail Traffic Controller (RTC), and RailSys respectively, on a single shared corridor. It evaluates the potential operational benefits of a hybrid approach where output from one software (RTC) is used as input for optimization at another (RailSys) and then brought back to RTC for validation."
