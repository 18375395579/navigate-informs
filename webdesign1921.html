2013"We estimate flight-level price elasticities using a database of online prices and seat map displays. We use an approach that corrected for price endogeneity; failure to do so resulted in incorrect pricing recommendations. We use an instrumented variable approach (two-stage least squares regression) to address this problem, and find a set of valid instruments that can be used in future studies of air travel demand.  We use elasticity results to show how airlines can design better promotions and strategically match a subset of their competitors?sale fares."
