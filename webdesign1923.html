2008"In the newsvendor framework empirical observations show that actual order quantities deviate from optimal quantities suggested by the model, so that risk averse decision making behavior is introduced. On the other hand, including pricing as a decision has become another important stream of research.  We combine those streams by modeling risk aversion using the conditional value-at-risk and simultaneously optimizing on price and order quantity. We illustrate our approach with numerical examples."
