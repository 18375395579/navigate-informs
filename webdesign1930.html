2007"We reformulate a previously-developed static model of transmission investments in restructured electricity systems using a stochastic dynamic framework. In particular, we study the optimal transmission investment strategy of a network planner based on  equilibrium models characterizing the dynamic competitive interaction among oligopolistic generation firms."
