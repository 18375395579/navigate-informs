2012"We present a model simulating the workforce within a single specialty at a national level which includes students training to enter the profession, providing a tool that would help to inform future resource planning. This presentation includes details of the model, developed using system dynamics modeling, and a demonstration of it using the example of cardiac surgeons in Canada, and analyzes the effect of provider motivations on system outcomes."
