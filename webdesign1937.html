2007"In complex systems, available sensing signals are usually the combined responses of multiple embedded operations, which generate a high dimensional nonlinear profile data, and cause challenges in finding failed individual operations. In this research, wavelet analysis is used to achieve automatic signal segmentation with the enhanced diagnosability of individual operation conditions."
