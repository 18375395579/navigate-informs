2008"We describe a portfolio analysis approach to modeling the value of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s investment options that was used to select portfolios of environmental observing systems that best satisfy NOAA’s mission-critical observing requirements at target budget constraints.  The approach is based on capability-based performance measures that satisfy recent Government acquisition and planning regulations."
