2008"Dynamic models of imperfect competition are used in applied economics to analyze diverse dynamic phenomena. The computational complexity of solving for the equilibrium has severely limited the applicability of these models. We introduce approximation methods based on the LP approach to approximate dynamic programming that dramatically reduce the computational complexity. Our methods greatly increase the set of dynamic models of imperfect competition that can be analyzed computationally."
