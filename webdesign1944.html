2006"Several hundred even thousand concurrent auctions for the same or similar item take place on eBay every day. We investigate the question whether concurrency has an effect on an auction's price. We propose a spatio-temporal semiparametric model. The spatial model component accounts for item similarity. The temporal component accounts for correlation in price over time. The flexible semiparametric approach results in high prediction accuracy. We illustrate our model on a set of laptop auctions."
