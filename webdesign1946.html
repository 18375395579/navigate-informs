2013"Atomistic molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations have been widely used to study nanomanufacturing processes, but the computational overhead has limited the simulations only to the initial nano-synthesis stage. A graph theory-based coarse-graining potential fitting approach was investigated to coarse grain the atomistic simulation, and realize large-scale simulation of the nanomanufacturing processes."
