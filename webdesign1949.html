2008"Public transit systems are heavily subsidized by local, state, and federal agencies. As much as 85 percent of the operating budget for some metropolitan bus systems is obtained from governmental sources.  As part of the process for obtaining funding, a relatively accurate forecast of ridership demand is necessary.  In this paper, we consider relevant factors that affect the forecast of ridership.  Alternative forecasting models are evaluated using data from a metropolitan transit authority."
