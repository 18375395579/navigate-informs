2012"Kriging has been very popular for analyzing computer experiments due to its accurate prediction. But it also needs extensive computation due to the matrix inversion involved in the predictor. We propose using the preconditioning approach to approximate the matrix inversion in the kriging predictor. How to construct the preconditioning matrix is crucial to the accuracy and efficiency of the approximate kriging. Here we suggest using the tapered correlation matrix as the preconditioning matrix."
