2012"We used a probabilistic model based on Bayesian learning and optimization techniques to estimate the mortality risk in post-operative patients. The model incorporates discrete and continuous risk factors and provides a probabilistic score associated with the risk. The feature selection procedure was applied in order to discard irrelevant risk factors and 70/30 cross-validation analysis was performed to estimate the accuracy of the model."
