2007"This study explores how information technology (IT) vendors match managers to outsourcing projects. Selecting the right person to lead an IT project is challenging, especially for larger vendors who have access to a myriad pool of talent and a vast divergence in projects. A consistent method of resource allocation is critical. We develop a two-stage model to optimize the fit between IT projects and project managers and evaluate the model using data collected from a major IT vendor."
