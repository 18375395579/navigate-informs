2012"The stochastic Sasol Solvents Global Tank Planning model was developed to provide a dynamic view of the global storage network for the Solvents business unit. This model provides the capabilities to simulate and evaluate current and future storage capacities and inventory development for multiple products when considering volume allocations and sales patterns in different regions. The model has been used in the business case for a re-configuration of current storage capacities."
