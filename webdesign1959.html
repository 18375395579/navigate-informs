2012"A coarse-grained atomistic simulation approach is essential for investigating nanostructure synthesis process after the initial nucleation stages due to the high computational overhead involved in classical atomistic simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo). We developed the effective potentials for the coarse-grained models. Simulations show that the coarse-grained approach can save over 50% of Monte Carlo simulation time."
