2012"Gaussian process models have become increasingly popular to model functional responses. Fitting these models requires computationally expensive matrix decomposition, a problem exacerbated with functional responses. Separability assumptions on the covariance function eases the computational  burden. This work models these functions without the separability assumption while maintaining the computational advantages."
