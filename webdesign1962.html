2007"An embedded M/G/V model is proposed for estimating the performance of automated vehicle storage and retrieval (AVSR) systems as functions of the major variables defining a storage system configuration. We consider a system consisting of V vehicles, each of which works together with a lift conditionally. The lift queue dynamics are described as a GI/G/L/V queue model nested in a general M/G/V queue model. The results of simulation validation studies illustrate the accuracy of this approach."
