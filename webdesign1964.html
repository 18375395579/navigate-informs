2012"Mammography, the current standard modality for breast cancer screening, is not perfect. Biopsy is often performed to verify the presence of cancer after positive results. We developed a discrete time finite-horizon Markov decision process model to optimize biopsy referral policies based on total expected quality-adjusted life years. The model incorporates individual’s breast cancer risk factors and mammogram screening history and allows the possibility of spontaneous disease regression."
