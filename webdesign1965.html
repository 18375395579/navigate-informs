2006"This study analyses a production-management model that considers the possibility of implementing a reverse-logistics system in a lean production environment, as opposed to models that use EOQ approaches. Decision variables are identified (including manufacturing and remanufacturing capacities) and optimal policies are determined. The conclusion drawn is that mixed policies can be optimal unlike the results published in earlier studies, which are based on more restrictive assumptions."
