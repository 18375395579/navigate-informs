" 2 - Multi-Flight Demand Untruncation with Recapture"

2006"We discuss a new method for demand untruncation using origin-destination booking activity across multiple flights in a market. This approach involves choice models which estimate market-class group demand across flights. We give closed-form solutions for estimating flight spill and recapture, unique to the specific pattern of flight closures and bookings. Computational experience with this methodology shows considerable promise in reducing forecast errors."
