" 4 - A New Objective Function for Network Clustering"
Marcus Perry, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States of America, mperry@cba.ua.edu"
2012"In this talk we propose a new objective function for network clustering that naturally lends to a statistical test on the significance of the detected clusters.  The proposed objective function also permits the use of information criterion for determining the appropriate number of clusters.  Using Monte Carlo simulation, we make performance comparisons between the proposed objective function and those obtained by maximizing modularity."
