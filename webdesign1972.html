2012"Health care capacity decisions are often based on average performance metrics such as occupancy, however these may hide the effects of variability in the system.    We demonstrate that occupancy and similar metrics do not reflect the ability of a healthcare system to provide patient service and propose using service based metrics for congestion as more suitable for healthcare settings.  We then provide a case study where these metrics were used to advise a capacity expansion project."
