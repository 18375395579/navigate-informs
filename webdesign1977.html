2012"It is possible to use prediction models to obtain periodic forecasts about a hurricane’s main characteristics such as its path, wind force and time of landfall. Using this information we present a dynamic model for prepositioning supplies in such a setting. Our model has two distinguishing features: possible destruction of supply points during the disaster event, and the use of forecast information updates in order to strategically modify and improve the prepositioned quantities and locations."
