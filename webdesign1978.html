2012"The goal of this talk is to describe an integrated modeling approach for hurricane evacuation modeling from behavioral and simulation modeling. Various behavioral dimensions that influence households to evacuate will be discussed including the timing of evacuation, the destination choice and route choice. The models are estimated with data from Hurricane Ivan. A large scale simulation model will be demonstrated to show the efficiency of the evacuation clearance times."
