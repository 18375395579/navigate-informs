2013"Steady-state detection is critical in process performance assessment, fault detection and process control. We proposed a robust on-line steady-state detection algorithm using multiple change-point model and particle filtering techniques. The steady-state detection problem is formulated as a multiple change-point problem using a segmental linear model."
