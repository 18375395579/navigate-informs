2007"Bids in online auctions arrive at discrete timepoints. We represent the continuous price-process as a functional object. Typical nonparametric smoothing (e.g., p-splines or monotone splines) used to estimate price curves from observed discrete bid data has several limitations. We present a parametric family of growth models that overcomes these limitations. It is parsimonious, insightful, and useful. A measure of fit and automated fitting algorithm are provided. eBay data used for illustration."
