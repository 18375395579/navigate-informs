2013"Power market operators are creating short-run “flexiramp?markets to manage increased volatility of net loads due to renewables. We evaluate flexiramp market designs by comparing solutions of (1) a deterministic unit commitment and dispatch model with a flexible ramping constraint with (2) a stochastic unit commitment model. We compare them in terms expected performance, in terms of costs, prices, and reliability."
