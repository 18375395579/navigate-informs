2007"The requirement of the large-scale modeling calls for the development of the Multi-Resolution Assignment and Loading of Traffic Activities (MALTA). This talk presents the spatially scalable dynamic traffic assignment (SSDTA) based modeling approach in MALTA that is of particular advantage for large-scale traffic modeling. Modeling approaches and system framework are presented. We will also present one particular example of applying MALTA to a major U.S. metropolitan area."
