2006"Modeling flight delays and cancellations at an airport using statistical and analytical methods require as input the airport capacity during different time intervals of a day. In this paper, we present a statistical model to estimate the arrival capacity of an airport during any time interval, based on several factors such as runway configuration, meteorological conditions, etc. We show that these estimates reduce the prediction error of existing models for delays and cancellation."
