2008"We discuss a network design model built and implemented for a candy company with a national distribution network.  The model chooses which pool points (distribution centers) to use, which customers to serve direct and which to serve LTL, which shipping arcs to use (incurring a fixed cost), and the timing and routing of trucks through the network.  We present the model and solution methods and discuss data-processing challenges and implications of the solution for the company's supply chain."
