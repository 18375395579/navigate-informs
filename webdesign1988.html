2006"Previous research related to the Newsvendor model has taken the mismatch cost parameters as given. Following the tradition of structural estimation models in Econometrics, we assume that the decision maker acts rationally and chooses the optimal decision for a cost function that is un-observable for us as researchers. Based on the observed decision making and a set of co-variates, we use Maximum Likelihood estimation to obtain the cost parameters describing the latent cost function."
