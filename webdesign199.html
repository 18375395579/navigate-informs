2012"Characterizing mobility network traffic is one of the most challenging tasks in mobility network planning and designing, especially when special events may occur in some areas. The spatial neighbour cell towers are highly correlated to each other, especially for the rare events. In this paper, we propose multivaraite Copulas model to detect the rare event clusters base on the spatial temporal data collected from mobility traffic data"
