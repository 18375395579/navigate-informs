2008"In this talk we analyze the availability of backbone communication networks in the presence of multiple links failures. Due to built-in redundancy and protection mechanisms such networks are highly reliable. This makes them difficult to evaluate through traditional means since their failures are comprised of numerous rare events.  In this talk we will present efficient availability evaluation methods based on genetic algorithms and show their advantage over traditional Monte-Carlo based methods."
