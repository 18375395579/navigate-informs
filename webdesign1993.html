2013"We consider statistical process control (SPC) when the parametric form   of the process distribution is unavailable. In the literature, some   nonparametric SPC charts have been proposed based on the ordering   information of the observed data. We present an alternative   framework for constructing nonparametric control charts using categorical  data analysis. This framework is demonstrated to work well in  various applications."
