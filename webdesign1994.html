2013"We built a dynamic transmission microsimulation of TB in India. The model incorporates treatment algorithms and empirically observed coverage and treatment uptake, and individuals are characterized by demographic and disease characteristics. We calibrated the model to demographic patterns and epidemiological data. We find that Indian drug resistant TB is transitioning from being primarily treatment- to transmission-generated, and we explore disease control implications of this change."
