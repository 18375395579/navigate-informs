2008"Heterogeneous data from wide-area sensor infrastructures are processed through innovative knowledge discovery methodologies to develop multivariate characterizations of normal behavior, which in turn produces risk-based delineation of unusual behavior. The approach is illustrated in the context of transportation safety and security. A risk-based assessment is developed to categorize commercial trucks into safety or security hazards based on their weight profiles and radioactive signatures."
