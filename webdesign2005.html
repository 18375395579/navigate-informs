2013"This session will focus on the Health Belief Model as a predictor of health behaviors of individuals. The Health Belief Model is a model utilized in health care to attempt to explain and predict health behaviors (Glanz, K., Marcus Lewis, F. & Rimer, B.K. (1997), The Health Belief Model can used as a predictor. However the variables that influence an individual’s decisions about health care are based on focusing on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals. There are times when calculations based on mathematical models to anticipate and predict chronic diseases can be inaccurate. The outcomes of individual attitudes and beliefs about managing chronic disease frequently cannot be mathematically derived with accuracy. This session will discuss utilization of the Health Belief Model as an indicator for the management of chronic diseases. The session will include a discussion about high fidelity simulation and how that technology promotes advancements in   information sharing and can be a viable adjunct to identify and promote optimal health outcomes. Thus simulation utilization can aid in the management  of  chronic disease.    The objectives for this session include:   a. Understanding the concepts and application of the HBM in managing chronic diseases.   b. Identification of the influence of HBM as it relates to attitudes and beliefs on individual health care decisions.   c. Utilization of the HBM to explain and predict adherence to managing as a component of managing chronic disease.  d. Identification of  the  utility of use of high fidelity simulation to aid in the management of chronic disease(s)."
