2012"We extend a well-known risk measure that measures the impact of uncertainty  resulting from mis-specification of derivative models by using an  optimization-based approach that uses distributions based on non-parametric  specification. This allows for incorporation of a much wider class of  distributions that results in more revealing measures. Our risk measure can be  formulated as a semi-definite optimization problem and can be efficiently  solved."
