2006"Uncontrolled epilepsy poses a significant burden to society due to associated healthcarecost to treat and control the unpredictable and spontaneous occurrence of seizures. In this talk, we present a novel classification technique, Nearest Dynamic Time Warping Neighbor, used to classify normal and epileptic brain activities through quantitative analyses of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. This technique employs dynamic programming to excavate hidden patterns/relationships in the brain."
