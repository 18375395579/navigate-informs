2012"We develop algorithms for Bayesian Aggregation (BA) of evidence collected by mobile gamma-ray spectrometers to produce probabilistic maps of spatiotemporal distributions of radiological threat in urban environments such as cities and buildings. BA enables simultaneous estimation of radiating source locations and their intensities, in the presence of varied background radiation. We provide results of empirical evaluations using real field data with realistic injections of synthetic threats."
