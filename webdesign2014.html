2012"We analyze the impact of Volcker rule by using a stochastic control model that we calibrate to a sample of U.S. banks. If a bank’s trading alpha and its correlation between trading and banking cash flows are both zero then it is optimal for the bank not to trade at all. We estimate a simple worst case scenario by solving how much the banks should raise their loan rates to compensate the value decrease from the Volcker rule."
