2013"In this study, we try to model the alternative level of care (ALC) patients flow to show the effect of downstream capacities on number of ALC patients and their length of stays in acute care facilities. We develop queuing network model to capture patients flow using a heuristic approximation method to find the steady state parameters of the model."
