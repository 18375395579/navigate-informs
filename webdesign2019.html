2013"We study optimal public-private partnerships (PPPs) in disaster management using a sequential game where the government is the first mover. We model the risk preferences of the private sector using prospect utilities. We strike to identify (nearly) optimal PPPs when qualitative human behaviors and quantitative risk factors are considered. This paper provides insights on whether, when, and how much investment/subsidy could form a healthy and sustainable PPPS in disaster management."
