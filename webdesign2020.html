2008"Retrofitting seismically-vulnerable transportation infrastructure (e.g., bridges) is essential in mitigating network functional loss and facilitating emergency evacuation. We propose an optimal resource planning model to prioritize seismic retrofit projects in a bridge network. Effective solution algorithms based on Lagrangian relaxation are developed. Numerical results of empirical examples are presented."
