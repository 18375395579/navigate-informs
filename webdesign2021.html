2007"COMPASS is an agent-based model designed to simulate the flow of sailors through the sequence of career decisions.  While COMPASS holds great promise as a policy evaluation tool, it is, by its very nature, computationally cumbersome.  To address these computational issues, we are developing a surrogate model to approximate COMPASS with enough accuracy to provide good  starting points for policy variables."
