2007"When working with real world, large-scale models there are many factors that come into play how to gain the optimum speed.  In addition to choosing the correct solver algorithms and tuning solver parameters, other factors include how the model is formulated for sparsity, what hardware (Intel, AMD, Unix, 64-bit) gives best results, and what type of datasources (text, binary, spreadsheet, databases, etc.) are used.  In this presentation, we will report on our experiences and performance tests."
