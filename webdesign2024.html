2007"We present a multicriteria supplier selection model where a primary and a sequence of backup suppliers are assigned at each customer. A similar model has previously been proposed for a facility location problem without capacity constraints. The model developed in this study considers capacity restrictions and covers cost, quality, lead time and disruption risk as criteria. Several different multicriteria techniques have been applied to solve the model and the solutions have been compared."
