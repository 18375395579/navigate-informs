2013"In this research, we develop a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming model for scheduling elective surgery patients. The resource availability as well as the possibilities for expanding the current resource levels for operating rooms and downstream clinic units is considered in the model. The scenarios representing various durations of surgical operations are incorporated and the model is solved by employing the approach of sample average approximation."
