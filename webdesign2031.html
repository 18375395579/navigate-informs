2013"This talk discusses case studies that have been developed for pre-positioning supplies for a hurricane disaster event. We use models that have been recently published in the literature.  In terms of data sources we use HAZUS, a software developed by FEMA, and forecast data from the National Hurricane Center.  Insights from the case studies will be presented along with challenges and opportunities for new models and solution algorithms."
