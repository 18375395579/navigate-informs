2006"We propose a general framework for an enterprise level business decision model involving multiple stakeholders. The model enables trade offs through revenue and risk contributions. The revenue contribution is evaluated through cost structure analysis using Net Present Value. The risk contribution is evaluated employing the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The structured decision framework allows the multiple stakeholders to negotiate effectively to drive optimal enterprise level business decisions."
