2013"This paper presents a method for deriving probabilistic macroscopic traffic flow relations from Newell's simplified car-following model.  The probabilistic nature of the model allows investigating the impact of driver heterogeneity on macroscopic relations of traffic flow.  The physical features of the model are verified analytically.  An empirical study is carried out to obtain distributions of individual driver parameters and these are used to perform calculations with the probabilistic macroscopic relations."
