2008"In this paper we utilize a generalized recombining binomial lattice approach for valuing investment options under competition.   By using this approach, we are able to extend the work of Smit and Ankum (1993) and others who have synthesized discrete time option pricing models and game theory under the assumption of a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) stochastic process for the value of the underlying asset."
