2013"A simulation model for materials supply to mixed-model assembly lines will be discussed. The simulation model is created in FlexSim by means of an automatic model generator and demonstrates the in-plant logistical flows involved to supply parts from the warehouse to the assembly line. The results of the simulation model are compared to those of a deterministic mixed integer linear programming model. The findings of this study will be reported."
