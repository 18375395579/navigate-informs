2008"In contemporary computing practises algebraic modelling systems (AMLs) and solvers are two distinct software components used in the solution of real-world OR problems. Exchange of information between AMLs and solvers can happen through files or in memory. In each case both sides need to agree on the format that is used to describe a problem instance. This talk explores Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and data structures for use in stochastic programming."
