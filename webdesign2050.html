2007"Today’s supply chain operations are subject to various risks. Supply chain risks can be quantified in terms of potential loss of money, time, or material through simulation. Consequently, risk management strategies can be optimized through a simulation-optimization methodology and evaluated by performing a cost-benefit analysis. In this paper, the proposed approach is demonstrated using a refinery supply chain case study."
