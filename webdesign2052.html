2007"We study how the subjects play the game where the perspective employer should set an offer deadline and the employee should decide whether to accept it or to wait for more attractive offer from another employer. We discuss the observed deviations from the Nash Equilibrium and compare them to the ones observed in the experiments on ultimatum game. We also consider extensions to multiple employers and employees and discuss the implications for the optimal matching."
