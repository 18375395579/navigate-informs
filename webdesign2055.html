2012"The paper considers Capital Asset Price (CAPM) for tail risk measures: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and Conditional Drawdown-at-Risk.  We compared CAPM Beta based on Standard Deviation with Betas based on CVaR and CDaR. We ranked the performance of the hedge fund stiles using these new Betas."
