2013"We look at some less tangible facets of organizational culture that lead to successful lean transitions and Continuous Process Improvement.  We evaluated a conceptual model proposed by Lander and Liker (2007).  Our study population was at Tinker Air Logistics Complex, Oklahoma City where similar lean transformations were taking place. We measured the constructs in the model through structured interviews and success independently by supervisor evaluation. We found one condition proposed by the model, Structured Improvement Processes, to be statistically significantly correlated with successful CPI.  We found no evidence to contradict the other elements of the model. There is strong correlation  among the constructs of the model.   We further found that, at least in  our sample, having structured improvement events appears to help develop some of the model elements but is not directly linked to success"
