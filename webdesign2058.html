2007"Our paper provides both a theoretical framework on reference point formation over time, based on cumulative prospect theory’s inverse s-shaped weighting function, and a new experimental method for eliciting subjects?individual reference points in a finance context. Consistent with our model, we document our subjects?reference points to be best described by the first and the last price of the time series, with the equally weighted average and the highest price receiving smaller weights."
