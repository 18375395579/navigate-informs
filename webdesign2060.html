2012"Track geometry defects, including align, gage, cant, surface, crosslevel, warp and so on, can be categorized as red and yellow tickets by severity. Red tickets are mandatory to be fixed by law but not yellow tickets. We proposed a risk model to prioritize yellow tickets by estimating its derailment risk. Given the inputs from risk model and other constraints, a repair schedule optimization model was developed to further reduce total cost on potential derailment and maintenance."
