2006"We present results of an approach based on conditional expectations for Privacy Preserving Data Estimation. The approach uses machine-based learning to obtain the relationships among confidential and non-confidential variables in the form of conditional expectations and applies existing methods of data perturbation and data shuffling to optimize data security while providing data utility. The approach can be applied even when the realationships are non-monotonic, under certain conditions."
