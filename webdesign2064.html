" 1 - Learning Bayesian Networks: Methodology and Applications"
Marek J. Druzdzel, Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Decision Systems Laboratory, 135 North Bellefield Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, United States, marek@sis.pitt.edu"
2006"I will summarize the existing techniques for learning directed probabilistic models, such as Bayesian networks, from data.  I will give examples of applications and point out possible pitfalls related to learning models from data.  Finally, I will demonstrate GeNIe, a computer program developed in the Decision Systems Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh and available at http://genie.sis.pitt.edu/, that allows for learning models from data and using them to support decisions under uncertainty."
