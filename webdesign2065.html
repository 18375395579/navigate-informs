2007"Over the past few years model complexity in quantitative finance has increased substantially in response to earlier models that did not capture critical events for risk management. However, it is still not clear that the increased complexity is matched by additional accuracy in the ultimate result. In the specific context of option pricing addressed in this talk, I compare the pricing accuracy of two models: one that consists of the standard geometric Brownian motion with constant coefficients, and another where the volatility coefficient is itself a stochastic process. The data for the study are based on S&P 100 index options; the estimation methodology on indirect inference, and the pricing approach is an extension of the regression-based simulation method of Longstaff and Schwartz (2001)."
