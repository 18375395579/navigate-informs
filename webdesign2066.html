2012"In many engineering systems, such as smart grids, water distribution systems, and various mechanical systems, the system lifetime is affected by those of individual components and their interactions. In this work, we present a degradation framework that characterizes the interactions among the degradation  processes of components and predict component residual life times using real-time sensory data. We conduct a series of simulation studies and compare the performance of our approach with a benchmark model. The results show that our prediction of the residual life distribution is more accurate, compared with the benchmark model, in which component interactions are not taken into account."
