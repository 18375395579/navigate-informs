2008"Geospatially enriched synthetic environments are needed for development and assessment of unmanned ground vehicle performance to support sensor fusion and sense making. How can the high  fidelity/resolution environment achieved via high performance computing be integrated to inform simulations addressing critical questions? This presentation will address the investigation of a multi-resolution modeling capability and results and lessons learned in developing an experiment for proof of concept."
