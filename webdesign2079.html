2008"Ambulance redeployment is the practice of repositioning idle ambulances in real time to compensate for other ambulances that are busy, in an attempt to improve response times to calls. We use approximate dynamic programming, in conjunction with discrete-event simulation. The key step is to identify a suitable class of basis functions. We sketch the overall methodology, describe the basis functions used, and provide computational results."
