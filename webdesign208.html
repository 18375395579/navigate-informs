2013"We develop a spatially explicit susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model of invasion spread dynamics. The model allows for invasion control via spread prevention and local eradication. We use the model to identify optimal spatial-dynamic control strategies for minimizing total invasion costs and damages and show how landscape geometry affects optimal approaches. In general, optimal control strategies slow or prevent invasion spread in the direction of greatest potential long-term damages."
