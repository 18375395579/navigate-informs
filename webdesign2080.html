2012"In this paper, we analyze a variety of algorithmic methods that can be used by the investigators of different fraud scenarios. We argue that the use of various social network overlays, coupled with graph theoretic concepts, is helpful in fraud investigation, particularly when fraud involves multiple perpetrators who may be insiders of the victim organization. We also present a set of consistent metrics that could be used to select and calibrate particular investigative techniques."
