2007"The ability of a Model I LP formulation to represent spatial phenomena is becoming increasingly important in an environment where strategic forest management is required to account for a broad variety of forest values.  However, these models can easily become quite large.  Here we report on the use of an approach similar to Forrest's SPRINT that appears to be well suited to deal with these large models."
