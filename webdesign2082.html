2013"We aim to address the problem of decision-making under uncertainty in the case of heavy-tailed distributions of losses. In our study we introduce a family of risk measures, which we call log-exponential risk measures, and show that they posses important methodological properties, such as convexity. We expect, that the introduced measures may be suitable to model risk-averse decision making in the presence of catastrophic risk, and our case study with real-life data showed promising results."
