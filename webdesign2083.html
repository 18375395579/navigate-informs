2007"Inventory control decisions are made based on assumptions and estimates   of demand levels. But those decisions also affect demand levels, and a  complete inventory control model recognizes the use of control decisions  to both meet current demand and modify future demand. In this paper, we  look at a simple inventory control model with a demand that responds to  satisfaction of previous demand and propose a simple framework to  determine the value of these control decisions."
