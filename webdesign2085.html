2008"Direct aperture optimization of IMRT treatment plans allows for a much more accurate modeling of treatment delivery aspects than traditional beamlet-based treatment plan optimization. We extend a column generation approach for direct aperture optimization to include total beam-on time as one of the treatment plan evaluation criteria and use this model to determine the Pareto efficient frontier of treatment plan quality and beam-on time for clinical patient cases."
