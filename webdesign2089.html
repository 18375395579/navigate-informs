2013"We formulate multiple generalized linear models to predict breast cancer probabilities for women with various backgrounds, in order to provide decision aids on mammography screening schedules. The independent covariates include various breast cancer risk factors. H measure is used to select the best model. We use the misclassification cost term criterion to calculate the optimal age-specific cut-off points of cancer probabilities for accepting a mammogram with the least loss of life expectancy"
