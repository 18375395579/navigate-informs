2013"Fixed and variable costs used in supply chain management decision models are often based on approximations. Activity-based costing (ABC) methods allow decision makers to distribute indirect costs on activities and products. However, application of ABC to divergent production systems remains challenging for many reasons. This talk will present a methodology to apply ABC methods in divergent production systems. This methodology is validated using two case studies from the sawmilling industry."
