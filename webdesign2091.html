2013"In this study, a new dynamic traffic assignment model, travel time transmission (TTM) model, is proposed based on the Lagrangian-space traffic flow model. The proposed model preserves both the link-cell representation from the space-time CTM model and the numerical and formulation benefits of the Lagrangian models. Mobile sensor data collected by probe vehicles and future connected vehicles can be easily plugged into the TTM model efficiently."
