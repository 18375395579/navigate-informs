2007"To reduce the effect of delays on New York flights, strategic, traffic flow management control strategies were calculated from an aircraft-level model using both heuristic and optimization solution methodologies. The results are presented in terms of aggregate- and aircraft-level flight delay, equity, and routing metrics."
