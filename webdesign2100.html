2013"The objective of this research is to improve resource utilization at an outpatient Cancer Clinic. An optimization model was developed to maximize infusion chair utilization. The model takes into consideration the balance of human resource workload.  This yields a more realistic model that takes into account constraints in physical and mental demand."
