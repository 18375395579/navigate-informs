2008"Formulating stochastic models in a modeling language and deploying it to end-users has long been a challenge in practice. In this presentation we will review how both scenario-based and independent variables stochastic models can be effectively formulated in a modeling language, such as MPL. Several formulations of SP models will be demonstrated."
