2006"Modeling methods for the prediction of low density events from geospatial data attempts to describe underlying patterns of low density events as a function of geospatial statistics.  Predictive models compared include pattern recognition and regression methods such as kernel partial least squares regression, support vector machines, poisson regression, linear regression, and kernel density with spatial preference.  This modeling approach has shown promise in predicting crimes and combat events."
