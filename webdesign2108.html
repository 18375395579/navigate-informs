2007"We present a prototype simulation model for an Outpatient Procedure Center (OPC) of Mayo Clinic which has 11 Operating Rooms(ORs). We propose simple heuristics to schedule arrivals for each department in the OPC and investigate how the schedule affects average patient waiting time and OR utilization. We use a Genetic Algorithm to generate  the (near) Pareto Optimal front."
