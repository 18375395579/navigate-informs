2012"Technology-related programmatic decisions often must rely on model-based analysis and limited empirical data. In many radiation detection applications, for example, it is infeasible to physically test prototype systems against actual threat devices in all relevant operational environments. This talk will describe methodology for using limited data and models to estimate performance of candidate detection systems in a range of potential environments prior to acquisition and deployment."
