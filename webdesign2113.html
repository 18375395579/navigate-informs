2008"In this research, the existing simulation models for crossdocking systems are examined. Modeling assumptions and other salient features are compared and contrasted. Through this taxonomic study, we hope to identify factors that affect the performance of crossdocks. Further, we would like to develop a comprehensive framework for a simulation study."
