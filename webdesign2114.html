2007"The early prediction of activity related characteristics of drug candidates is an important problem in drug design. The activities of drug candidates are classified as low or high depending on their IC50 values. We use a novel MILP approach in combination with partial least squares regression to determine the most relevant molecular descriptors of the drug molecules in efficient classification. The results indicate that our approach outperforms the other approaches reported in the literature."
