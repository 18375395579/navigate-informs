2012"We present reliability and maintenance models for systems subject to multiple dependent competing failure processes with a changing and dependent failure threshold. Three cases of dependency between shock process and hard failure threshold level are studied. Reliability models are developed based on degradation and random shock modeling. Two preventive maintenance policies are also applied and compared. Then an MEMS example is given to demonstrate the reliability models and maintenance polices."
