2013"We investigate two multi-period ambulance relocation problems for daily ambulance operations using p-median models: 1) all incidents require service in the period in which they occur, and 2) incident service delays are allowed for a cost. Facility location, fleet size, incident pattern, and time-dependent factors are considered in the experimentation while comparing the two models. We analyze the trade-off between service quality and cost quantitatively via a detailed sensitivity analysis."
