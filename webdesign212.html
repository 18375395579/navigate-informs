2012"We propose a dynamic model to explain product usage in categories characterized by frequent updates and progression of consumer involvement. Examples of such categories include TV series, software, and books. Consumer utility depends on intrinsic preferences, social interaction and expectations about future content. We use data from the computer game “World of Warcraft?to implement our model. We offer managerial recommendations to improve decisions on product innovation in these categories."
