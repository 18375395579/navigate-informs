2007"A model is considered where a commuter’s transportation mode choice is influenced by his peers' mode share, and which accounts for common unobserved attributes of choice alternatives in the error structure. Non-global interactions are addressed within different network structures, combining advanced econometric estimation with computational techniques from multi-agent based simulation. Effects of sample size, initial conditions, geographic scale and systematic omitted links are explored."
