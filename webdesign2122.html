2012"Border-crossing stations are often modeled using two connected birth-death Markov chains. However, the performance analysis of a model of border-crossing stations is complicated. We propose a new method to analyze such connected Markov chains. The method enables us to decompose Markov chains into basic sub-chains and makes our analysis simpler."
