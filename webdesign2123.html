2008"The bidding behavior in online auctions has some unique features not shared with the bidding in traditional auctions. This paper discusses analytical and empirical models regarding online bidding. The objective of the analysis is to present a framework for how auctions progress, and to characterize the conditional final price as auctions evolve. Data validation includes analysis of 40,000 bids from 4,000 laptop and desktop auctions from a large PC manufacturer."
