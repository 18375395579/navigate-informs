2008"We introduce a new method of combined synthesis and inference of biological signal transduction networks. We validate the biological usability of our approach by successfully applying it to a previously published signal transduction network and by using it to synthesize and simplify a novel network corresponding to activation induced cell death in large granular lymphocyte leukemia."
