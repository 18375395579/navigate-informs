2012"Using a database of sequences of health events, we wish to learn a predictor that can use a patient's current medical history to predict future health events. We use ideas from supervised ranking to develop a framework for sequential predictions that allows for a variety of modeling choices. We apply our method to health event data from a clinical trial and demonstrate good performance."
