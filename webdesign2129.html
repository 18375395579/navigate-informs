2008"The Decision Analysis Publication Award is given annually to the best decision analysis article or book published two years earlier. To be considered for this year’s award, a work must have been published during 2006. The intent of the award is to recognize the best publication in decision analysis, broadly defined -- including theoretical work on decision analysis methodology, descriptions of applications, and/or experimental studies."
