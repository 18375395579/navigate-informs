2007"Incremental data mining is the process of updating data mining models in light of new observations. We offer cube-based approach for storing data that allows one to update knowledge without increasing the storage requirements to accommodate the new data.  We implemented this approach on five different data mining algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, classification, clustering, and rule induction, obtaining results which are not much different than those obtained with the original dataset."
