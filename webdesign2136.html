2007"Hospital patient flow has tremendous implications on the delivery of care and on hospital finances.  Focusing on overcrowding and resource loading, patient flow models of a hospital are developed using Petri Nets.  These models are used to determine the minimum sequence of events leading a hospital from a desirable operating state to an undesirable state such as ambulance diversion. A two-phase mixed-integer programming formulation is used to generate this sequence."
