2006"This paper proposes a generic system model based on context trees to predict system behaviors for the purpose of fault detection and isolation in a multistage software system. The approach consists of learning multistage model structures by capturing the expected statistical distribution of input/output at different stages and detecting departures from the expected model structures."
