2012"A new approach was proposed and implemented at MISO to address the reserve deliverability issue. MISO enhanced the co-optimization process so that it can evaluate the impact that deploying cleared reserves on a zonal basis would have on specified transmission constraints. Reserve zone requirements are solved to meet both market-wide reserve requirements and deliverability requirements.  MISO is looking at a more comprehensive solution in which procurement of reserves is modeled on a nodal basis."
