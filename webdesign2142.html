2006"We investigate stochastic models for rating transitions and propose a Bayesian framework for calibrating these models using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The methodology is applied to the analysis of a recent data set of global corporate defaults and rating transitions from Standard and Poor’s, covering the period 1981 to 2004."
