2013"A DDDAMS-based planning and control framework is proposed, which 1) devises a best control strategy via crowd detection, tracking, and motion planning in agent-based simulation, 2) controls real UAVs/UGVs via monitoring, data processing, task generation, and execution, and 3) adjusts modeling scales over time adapting to system performance and computations. Experimental results demonstrate system robustness against various configurations, crowd coverage improvement, and computational savings."
