2012"We investigate whether the conditional CAPM helps explain the value premium using varying-coefficient single-index model. Such modeling allows for nonlinear dependence of conditional beta on state variables and significant variables are selected exhaustively. We find conditional beta co-moves with unemployment and inflation, and the price-earnings ratio. The alpha is smaller for the conditional CAPM than for the unconditional CAPM; nevertheless, neither model fully explains the value premium."
