2013"In this paper, we study the Time dependent mobility allowance shuttle transit (MAST). Travel time function is depends on the departure time from a node and different travel time is generated and meets the FIFO property. First, we build a time dependent MAST model. Secondly , we use a time dependent shortest path algorithms to linearize the non-linear term in the proposed model. Finally, some simulation would be conducted."
