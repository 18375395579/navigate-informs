2012"We address sequencing and resource allocation of stages in a multi-stage service encounter where customer perceptions of experience are important, as in the hospitality industry.  We employ evidence from behavioral studies about how people evaluate and retain memories of experiences.  We model these phenomena parsimoniously, and use the models to design service processes so as to maximize ex-post customer satisfaction."
