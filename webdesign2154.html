2012"To reduce the number of nodes searched in branch-and-bound algorithms, Kilin?Karzan et al. (2009) proposed a branching scheme that collects information during the search and uses it in a restart phase. We implement variants of this approach that exploit parallelism in the collection or use of information and report computational results."
