2008"In this talk we introduce the concept of augmented fluid models (AFM). AFM’s are related but more powerful than traditional fluid models because they can be used to establish the stability of policies that cannot be analyzed using traditional fluid models. We illustrate how AFM’s can be used by solving some open problems from the literature. In particular, we focus on N-model systems with multiple servers under static-priority policies and threshold-type policies."
