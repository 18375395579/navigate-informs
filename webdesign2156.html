2013"We develop a modeling framework that incorporates the dynamically evolving futures prices to negotiate forward contracts with the supplier when procurement cycle is not synchronized with the maturity of the futures contracts. We test our model using multi-factor, single-factor, and regression based price models on futures prices from CME and NYMEX.  We conclude that regression based models perform better than more complex single-factor price model, but worse than the multi-factor price models."
