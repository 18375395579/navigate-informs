2007"The search engine Google uses the PageRanks of web pages to determine the  order (rank) in which they are displayed to the user. In this work we  expand Google's idea of web page ranking to ranking National Football  League teams. The objective is to be able to rank NFL teams by their  relative strengths using a new algorithm and to compare the results to  existing ranking algorithms. The algorithms are implemented and tested  using SAS/IML."
