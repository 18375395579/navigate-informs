2012"The U.S. Army uses optimization models to manage manpower policies. We present how current objective force models of the Army Medical Department can be extended to provide optimal manpower policies for the current force. We study two models: a linear goal program and a system dynamics model. The first is an extension of current models used today and the system dynamics model includes the study of how an individual’s probability of continuation is influenced by additional, important factors."
