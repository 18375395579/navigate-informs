2007"Recent research on dynamic transit assignment has suggested models that could be quite different than existing static transit assignment methods.  We investigate a dynamic, "strategy-based" model for transit assignment.  This model describes both sequential passenger behavior at a stop as well as sequential behavior through the transit network. Characteristics of this model are discussed and are compared with existing assignment models."
