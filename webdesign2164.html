2007"We propose a new model of strategic investment to explore investment-timing trade-offs. Our model incorporates two distinctive elements compared with conventional output-setting games. First we allow firms to announce and commit to a generic investment strategy in advance. Second we include a fixed cost for investment. By applying the proposed modeling framework to a symmetric-duopoly capital-intensive industry, we find that a symmetric preemptive equilibrium is the most likely outcome."
