2008"The mean-variance portfolio optimization requires the estimation of the expected return and the covariance matrix. Since this estimation is very hard while the estimation error could lead to unstable portfolios, we study the non-parametric framework where assets?ranking is used instead of their estimated return. The corresponding robust model (where the uncertainty set is very large & discrete) can be solved efficiently using the constraint generation method together with a network flow model."
