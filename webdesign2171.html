2012"We generate realistic victim profiles for medical disaster simulations based on medical expertise. We apply these profiles in a medical disaster model where victim entities evolve in parallel through a medical response model and a victim pathway model. The medical response model focuses on the pre-hospital phase which includes triage procedures, evacuation processes and medical processes. Medical decisions such as whether to evacuate or to treat the current victim are based on its RPM score."
