2013"A metaconstraint is a constraint endowed with behavioral parameters for relaxation, branching, and inference. Relaxations of metaconstraints introduce new auxiliary variables that are related to other variables in the model. Semantic typing facilitates the detection and enforcement of such relations by giving variables a specific meaning, yielding stronger models. It also provides other modeling benefits, such as error detection. We motivate and illustrate these concepts through examples."
