2013"We propose an operational framework for mass evacuation that integrates the three major aspects that shape an evacuation operation: demand, supply, and disaster. It is a stage-based framework where a rolling horizon approach is used to capture the dynamics of the evacuation network. An on-line calibration approach is developed in terms of evacuee behavior modeling. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate operational performance from both traffic and disaster management perspectives."
