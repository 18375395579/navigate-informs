2012"We propose a model generation method that uses derivative-based and derivative-free optimization alongside machine learning and statistical techniques to learn algebraic models of detailed simulations. Once a candidate set of models is defined, they are tested, exploited, and improved through the use of derivative-free solvers to adaptively sample new points. We provide extensive computational experience with ALAMO, a code that we have developed to implement this strategy."
