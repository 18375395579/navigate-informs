Principal-agent models can in theory be used to construct a pay-for-performance system for Medicare’s dialysis program, but little is known about the underlying model parameters. We develop a procedure for inferring the provider's cost parameters from its past outcomes, making it possible to implement the optimal payment system. Numerical results will be presented."
