2013"Shortest path problem (SPP) is important to many applications in ITS and has been studied extensively in the literature. However, little attention has been paid to the SPPs within a signalized traffic network, especially with coordinated traffic signals. In this talk, we will discuss a shortest path search algorithm that will consider traffic signal coordination parameters. The model is tested using the real-world data collected from the City of Pasadena in California."
