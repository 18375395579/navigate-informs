2007"Scientists and engineers use computational simulations in the design and study of complex systems.  However, the usefulness of these simulations can hinge on the values of certain simulator parameters.   Thus, calibration procedures are applied to improve the quality of the simulations and to minimize underlying model uncertainties.  In this talk, we will describe how derivative-free optimization can play a key role in the calibration process and give some real world examples and results."
