2008"We extend the heat exchanger network synthesis (HENS) to include multi-component phase changes. We model the temperature-enthalpy relation using an empirical correlation especially for the nonlinear 2-phase region and extend the superstructure concept to the level of each exchanger to model phase changes for mixtures."
