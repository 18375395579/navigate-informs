2012"Variable upper bound flow models are well studied in the mixed-integer programming literature, and their study has yielded inequalities that are useful in computation. We consider a multi-commodity generalization of variable upper bound flow models. We perform a polyhedral study of this extended model, investigating novel aspects of its structure while also examining its relationship to the single-commodity case."
