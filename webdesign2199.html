2013"How can one select a sequence of experiments to maximize the value of costly experimental data? We formulate this optimal sequential experimental design problem in a POMDP framework, maximizing the expected information gain. Two major numerical issues are addressed: the representation of posterior distributions in a sequential Bayesian inference context, and the choice of features in value function approximation for ADP. Preliminary results are demonstrated on model problems and applications."
