2012"In this paper we consider utilizing DBN’s to model different market basket problems. The proposed approach can be used for learning and inference objectives, for both model parameters of a given structure and the dynamics of the structure itself. We use MCMC methods and use results from the DBN literature to devise learning algorithms in a time-series market basket data setting. We illustrate the implementation of proposed approach with low-dimensional problems and discuss their applications."
