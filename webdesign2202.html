2008"We describe a text-analytics problem occurring in CRM, search engines, and service center support, based on our work with Cisco. We discuss our novel use of DCM models in place of traditional multinomial models. We demonstrate significant improvement in search efficiency with enterprise-level-data and discuss the underlying analytic reasons."
