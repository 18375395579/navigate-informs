2008"We present a mixed integer nonlinear programming model for evacuation planning. The model considers shelter selection, contra-flow implementations and road availability.  This model is solved using a branch-and-cut approach with preprocessing. Data from Hurricane Katrina and existing studies establish the viability of our methodology."
