2012"We present a new simulation model for the wood pellet supply chain which considers the supply of raw materials, their transportation, production of pellets and finally distribution of pellets to domestic and international customers. It is based on a typical pellet mill in Canada and provides estimates of the cost and amount of delivered wood pellets. The model is used to evaluate different scenarios and the effects of changes in the supply chain on the outputs of the model."
