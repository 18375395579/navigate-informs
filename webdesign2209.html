2006"We consider the demand estimation problem faced by an airline flying an origin--destination market, accounting for customer choice behavior. We developed an statistical estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation. Modifications to account for unobservable data were developed using a variation of the expectation maximization method. The procedure was tested over data provided by a major commercial U.S. airline, showing promising results."
