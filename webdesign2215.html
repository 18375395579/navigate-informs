2012"This paper introduces a simulation method that allows a combination of different simulation techniques in one simulation.It is especially suitable for a large financial system where each sub-group of risk factors can be simulated by using different data source and special modeling methods. The hybrid simulation technique accommodates all sub-models into a system and use copula to support the correlation structure."
