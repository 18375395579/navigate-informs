2013"We examine how congestion in the ICU can impact the care pathway of patients and, ultimately, patient outcomes. We develop a stylized model for ICU admission and use the insights gained to develop an empirical framework, in which instrumental variable approach is used to identify the effect of the endogenous admission decision. We estimate these models using a large data set from an integrated healthcare delivery system and discuss the results?substantial health and financial implications."
