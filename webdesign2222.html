2012"We developed Logistic Regression models in predicting the likelihood that a withdrawn student will re-enroll with academic success.  Using students?geographical, academic, and financial information as predictive drivers, the models achieve a 0.84 C-statistic value on average on performance.  The models have been rolled out with re-enrollment management team at University of Phoenix."
