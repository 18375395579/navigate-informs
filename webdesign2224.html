2013"Software projects have inherent risks that are too complex and difficult to manage effectively through subjective judgment. For the first time, this study proposes an integrative framework for intelligent software project risk planning system to produce a cost-minimal action set for risk control based on the risk analysis module. To integrate complex risk factors, risk analysis knowledge and planning actions, a novel many-to-many actionable knowledge discovery (MMAKD) method has been proposed."
