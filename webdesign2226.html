2012"Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a complex, devastating, often rapidly fatal disease for which liver transplantation is a potentially lifesaving treatment.  However, many children with PALF will recover: these patients are not benefited by transplantation. Therefore, the decision to list a child for transplantation represents a complex optimal timing question. We present the development and early results of a physiologically based individual microsimulation model of PALF that can be used to evaluate different transplantation decisions."
