2007"Type II diabetes is one of the major underlying causes of stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD). Several models are available to guide clinicians on the risks of stroke and CHD. However, there are deviations between the probability estimates of these risk models. In this talk we discuss a robust MDP model to control diabetes related treatment decisions under ambiguous transition probabilities and present numerical results illustrating optimal treatment decisions."
