2012"In this study we focus on capacity value of Photovoltaic (PV) power and compare techniques that can be used for this purpose. These techniques consist of either reliability and statistical methods used to estimate the probability of a system outage event or simpler approximation techniques. We further investigate the effect of including subhourly data in our analysis."
