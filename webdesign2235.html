2006"Recent developments in condition-monitoring, the process of collecting sensor data to gauge the health of a system more accurately than what results from a priori knowledge alone, include Bayesian procedures for updating the residual life distribution of a system in real time. We present a cost-rate minimizing optimal-stopping decision model to determine, after each residual life distribution update, whether to perform preventive maintenance or to continue to the next observation time."
