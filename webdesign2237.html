2013"This study measures cost efficiency of hospitals using Data Envelopment Analysis, while adding quality variables as output factors, and compares the results with those of traditional models where quality variables are not considered as outputs. This study employs mortality rate of three major causes of death as well as traditional output variables such as total patient revenue, number of discharge, and inpatient days. This study analyzes hospitals in groups by control type, region, and size."
