2007"Theoretical models for the evaluation of search strategies are based on assumptions regarding the probability that a value selection heuristic makes a correct prediction. We provide an empirical evaluation of value selection heuristics for knapsack problems. We investigate how their accuracy varies as a function of depth in the search-tree, and how they are affected by the relative strength of inference methods like pruning and constraint propagation."
