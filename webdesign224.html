2012"This paper begins with a description of the Viable Systems Approach (VSA) as a framework for modeling service systems.  The process of abductive/inductive reasoning guides the epistemology and decision-making of agents in a viable service system.  We investigate the use of fuzzy logic and fuzzy control systems to model abductive/inductive reasoning.  We define different forms of viability and establish conditions for viability based on the performance of fuzzy controls."
