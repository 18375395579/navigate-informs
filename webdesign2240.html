2013"We characterize Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes time-changed with additive subordinators as time-inhomogeneous Markov semimartigales, based on which a new class of commodity derivative models is developed. Analytical solutions are obtained for European and Bermudan futures options via eigenfunction expansions, with American option prices computed efficiently via extrapolation."
