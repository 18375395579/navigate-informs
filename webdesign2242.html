2013"We describe a new approach for selecting best-fitting sets from a multi-target model calibration effort which applies the principles of Pareto-optimality.  We demonstrate the new approach using a simple model, developed for illustrative purposes, and a previously-published model used for a cost-effectiveness analysis of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).   We explore the implications of how best-fitting sets are selected on which policy is preferred and decision uncertainty."
