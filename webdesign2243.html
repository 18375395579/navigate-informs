2013"Traditional ruin models are constructed from a top-down approach. Motivated by models with large numbers of customers, specially in life insurance mathematics (including, for example, pension fund dynamics), we revisit some classical insurance models from a bottom-up perspective. We demonstrate how these important applications provide a natural framework for modern Operations Research techniques such as the diffusion approximations and large deviation analysis of many server systems."
