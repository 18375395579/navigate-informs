2007"This talk discusses strategies and techniques in data modeling, forecasting, and activity monitoring.  We will propose a general strategy for modeling, forecasting, and monitoring of dynamic systems.  In particular, we will discuss a statistical process control approach for business activity monitoring.  We will also discuss a churn detection procedure for customer profile modeling.  Some case studies in telecom and service industries will be used to illustrate the proposed methods."
