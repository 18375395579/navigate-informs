2012"Wind power supply uncertainty introduces significant uncertainties in day-ahead trading due to its impact on real-time electricity prices. In particular, in the day ahead market utilities face the challenge of self-commitment, self-scheduling and cycling decisions on slow units. We present a stochastic unit commitment model and solution methodology for addressing these challenges and demonstrate savings relative to current practice which is based on deterministic models."
