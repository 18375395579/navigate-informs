2012"Semiconductor manufacturing equipment relies on large amounts of complex input data including recipes, test programs, and lot information. This data needs to be routed in real-time to process equipment on the floor to avoid idle time/utilization loss. Instead of isolating the equipment from each other via a centralized database system the author has developed a distributed, peer-aware in-memory data store designed to optimize data delivery rates while providing virtually unlimited scalability."
