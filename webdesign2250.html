2008"A scenario planning approach is used to develop a supply chain disruption management model to mitigate disruptions of nodes and edges in a supply chain network. The proposed model is applied on a hypothetical case study. Fixed and operational costs, as well as the expected consequence of disruption under various failure scenarios were considered. The insight gained is used to design a network which would lead to the lowest long term disruption costs."
