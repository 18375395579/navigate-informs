2013"We consider the optimization of patient routine from an intensive care unit (ICU) when there are step-down units. We provide the characterization of the optimal routine policy and construct some easily implemented and efficient heuristics. We also propose a theoretic framework to optimize the capacities of variant inpatients units. The empirical data is used to calibrate the theoretical results."
