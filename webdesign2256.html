2007"We discuss strategies for accelerating convergence of Generating Set Search (GSS) by providing the ability to evaluate externally generated points. These modifications provide several new capabilities: 1) the user may runmultiple local searches simultaneously, 2) the user may concurrently use additional (non-GSS) optimization strategies while sharing common point evaluations, and 3) the ability to extend capabilities to global optimization."
