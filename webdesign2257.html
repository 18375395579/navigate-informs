2013"We use historical data to construct and validate distributional forecasts of procurement lead times and disbursement inter-arrival times for Global Fund grants in 53 African countries. We use a validated simulation model to predict impact of these processes on central stock availability of a single product facing constant demand. We find that adjusting disbursement amounts to reflect historical disbursement schedules mitigates the risk of stockouts better than bridge financing or a buffer stock."
