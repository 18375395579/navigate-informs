2013"The Crew Pairing Optimization problems which use well established set partitioning framework are known to be large scale MIPs, which are very difficult to solve. One of the many strategies employed to solve them is follow-on fixing in the column generation context. We talk about our experiments with and enhanced Crew Pairing Optimization model and using a relaxed follow-on fixing strategy. We identify benefits and limitations of using such strategy from practical perspective."
