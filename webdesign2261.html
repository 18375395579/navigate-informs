2007"We contrast optimal self-insurance choices with alternative models having inter-period versus intra-period utility functions.  After reviewing the axiomatic foundations of the models, we show that the intra-period model biases the decisions towards too little self insurance.  This result has implications for diverse settings in which the chosen size of an early commitment affects the magnitude of a subsequent risky consequence."
