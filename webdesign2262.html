2012"We present the selection and analysis of stress scenarios for financial risk assessment, with particular emphasis on identifying sensible combinations of stresses to multiple variables. We consider reverse stress testing - finding the most likely scenarios - using a nonparametric empirical likelihood estimator. We apply the results to marginal expected shortfall, macro stress scenarios, and scenario sampling method. This is a joint work with Paul Glasserman and Chulmin Kang."
