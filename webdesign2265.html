2012"We consider a bottom-up Markovian copula model of portfolio credit risk where dependence among credit names stems from the possibility of simultaneous defaults. Calibration of marginals and dependence parameters can be performed separately using a two-steps procedure, much like in a standard static copula set-up. As a result this model allows us to hedge CDO tranches using single-name CDS-s in a theoretically sound and practically convenient way."
