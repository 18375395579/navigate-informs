2013"We evaluate operating room efficiency in robotic surgery through portfolio based stochastic optimization.  Although the experience of every team member makes a difference, the performance in the operating room depends on the combination of experiences. Using actual data and integrating it into a stochastic optimization framework, we identify some results on optimal team configuration for robotic surgery."
