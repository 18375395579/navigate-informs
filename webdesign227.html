2007"We describe a federally-funded re-engineering of a business calculus course organized around the process of solving real-world problems using math models, calculus, and technology.  Students learn OR-style post-optimality analysis, including verification, validation, and sensitivity analysis, in doing student-generated projects on topics from their own lives.  Excel templates have been developed for 3-D graphing, fitting logistic models, and testing solutions for local and global optimality."
