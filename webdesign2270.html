2013"We present a nonparametric Bayesian model for analyzing the multi-modal growth of nanoparticles with ex-situ TEM image data in absence of in-situ observations. The model provides Bayesian estimation of multiple growth modes of nanoparticles. The estimation result was consistent with real nanoparticle growth trajectories in empirical studies."
