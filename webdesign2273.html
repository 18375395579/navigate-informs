2008"Current simulation software gives little or no guidance in making decisions regarding warm-up, run-length and number of replications.  A three year project sponsored by the EPSRC and SIMUL8 has investigated the development of a methodology for automatically advising a simulation user on these three key decisions.  This paper will present an overview of the work undertaken to create an automated procedure for carrying out simulation output analysis."
