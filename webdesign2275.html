2008"A method is proposed to analyze multivariate process capability (MPC). For a MP process the widely used Cp, Cpk for individuals do not provide complete conformance information. Yield is used for simultaneous conformity in MPC evaluation. A non-parametric bootstrap method is developed, i.e., approximating the pdf  by sampled data and a kernel model and sampling the pdf for yield estimation. A case study compares the estimated yield from 50 samples with the benchmark from a Beta distribution."
