2013"Our paper exploits the connection between multiattribute utility theory and high dimensional model representation theory for investigating the properties of multiattribute utility functions without stating any a-priori assumption on an individuals' preference structure. We test the method via an experiment in a riskless context in which subjects are asked to evaluate mobile phone packages that differ on three attributes. We obtain insights on monotonicity and additivity."
