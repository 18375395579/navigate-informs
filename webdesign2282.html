2008"Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and consequent ambulance diversion is one of the most pressing healthcare delivery problems in the US. In this paper we develop a two-stage queuing model to study the impact of structural factors such as the size and utilization of the hospital and the size of the ED on ambulance diversion status of the ED. We then test the key insights from our model using cross-sectional data on about 300 EDs in California and find moderate evidence for our results."
