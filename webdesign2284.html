2006"Not uncommon are designed experiments with the primary purpose being to determine optimal settings for all of the factors in some prescribed set.  Here we distinguish between the two concepts of statistical significance and practical significance.  We perform estimation via a Bayesian data analysis methodology that has been detailed in the recent literature.  But then propose an alternative to the usual next step in determining optimal factor settings."
