2007"In this paper, we introduce a new methodology to identify a module-based platform for service family design using service-based process analysis and data mining techniques. We employ fuzzy clustering to determine modules for platform design in a given service family. The clustering result is identified as a platform by the fuzzy set theory and classification. To demonstrate implementation of the proposed methodology, we use a case study involving a family of banking services."
