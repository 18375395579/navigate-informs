2013"To hedge against the risk of interdictions to facility systems,  planners may fortify the existing network to make it more  reliable, or design a network that is resilient to disruptions.  We present models addressing both topics, including a  defender-interdictor location model with uncertain futures, and  a location design model with heuristic and optimal  interdictions. Algorithms are discussed for both models."
