2013"We consider the capacity planning problem for a health network of 6 hospitals with the goal of reducing costs while keeping service quality within target. The complexity of the problem creates  difficulty for OptQuest with running the model. We consider distance based probabilistic routing, study the service quality of each hospital through G.G.C approximations, and derive the capacity  planning solution. The robustness of the model is further demonstrated via simulation."
