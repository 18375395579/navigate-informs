2007"The high dimensionality and data contamination present a challenge to the Phase I analysis of nonlinear profiles. This paper presents a strategy which constitutes a data reduction component that projects the original data into a lower dimension subspace and a data separation technique that detects single and multiple shifts as well as outliers in the data."
