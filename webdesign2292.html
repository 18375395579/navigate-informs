2012"Most of the IT security investment literature is based on single period analysis. In addition to the initial investment, a firm continues to exert effort to maintain the effectiveness of the IT infrastructure. We use a control theoretic framework to find the optimal IT security investment to minimize the expected total cost over a planning horizon. Our results can help firms decide how to invest in IT security given the type of the information system and the efficiency of the investment."
