2012"Advanced analytical methods typically model defender-attacker games by assuming a static decision-making process for players.  Over a series of plays and pay-offs, however, both defenders and attackers may adapt their decision-making strategy and their assumptions about the adversary’s decision-making strategy.  This research couples agent-based modeling with game theory to simulate the evolution of a game and pay-offs as players learn."
