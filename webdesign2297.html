2007"The Lipschitz Global Optimizer software handles constrained global and local optimization models under very general assumptions. We have developed two easy-to-use demo versions of LGO that can be used with a freely available C compiler (called Tiny C) as well as with the C# compiler (the latter is distributed by Microsoft). Both demo software versions are equipped with Windows GUIs. These demos can be used to develop and solve size limited (yet far from trivial) models in the classroom."
