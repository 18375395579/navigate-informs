2013"We develop a dynamical system based model to represent the evolution of path flows resulting from the day-to-day dynamics in the state of disequilibrium of transportation network under static demand. The proposed model is based on the proportional-switch adjustment process and is derived using insights from the multi-commodity economic market. The solution methodology is discussed and computational results are presented for a study network."
