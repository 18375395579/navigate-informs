2013"Problems with numerical noise form the key domain of Derivative-Free Optimization (DFO) algorithms and response surface methodology. We propose a general DFO algorithm for noisy problems. This algorithm utilizes regularized regression models that leverage between model complexity and the level of noise in a function. For controllable noise, an accuracy adjustment procedure is employed to dynamically reduce noise level. Numerical studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques."
