2012"We describe a general methodology for evaluating counterterrorism alternatives that accounts for an adaptive adversary planning to attack a U.S. target.  The central focus of the methodology is a model of terrorist objectives and values using a proxy multi-attribute utility model. Results suggest that terrorist preferences for attack mode are sensitive to certain counter-terrorism strategies and insensitive to others."
