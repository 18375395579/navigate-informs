2007"An important consideration in structure based drug design is the early estimation of drug activities using molecular descriptors. We address early prediction and classification of activities of drug candidates using the MILP based hyper-box approach with partial least squares regression to determine the most significant molecular descriptors of the drug molecules for an efficient classification. Our results indicate that it is possible ti obtain a 100% classification accuracy."
