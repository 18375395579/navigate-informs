2012"The presentation describes an bridge tunnel and traffic operations center scenario to assess the impact of cyber intrusion in a surface transportation system.  PRA simulation estimates the likelihood of each scenario.  The cyber effects are injected into regional transportation simulation to assess the consequences of the scenarios.  The desired outcome is to raise awareness of cyber issues associated with ICS and expose knowledge gaps and cyber vulnerability to critical infrastructure."
