2007"We describe ArchOptions, a model that uses real options theory to value the flexibility of an architecture in face of likely changes. We highlight the model use on two cases: (i) informing the selection of middleware-induced software architecture guided by the value added in supporting likely changes in load and (ii) valuing the cost-effectiveness of investing in a refactoring exercise. We reflect on our experience in using a value-driven approach to architecture evolution decision making."
