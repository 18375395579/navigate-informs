2013"This paper describes a trans-disciplinary research initiative aimed at developing an integrated traffic-driving-networking simulator for the design and evaluation of Cyber Transportation Systems and Connected Vehicle applications.  The study demonstrates the unique advantages of human-in-the-loop in the evaluation and design of CTS applications. A truly Cooperative Infrastructure and Vehicle Intersection Control is deployed to optimize both the signal timing and approach vehicle speed profile."
