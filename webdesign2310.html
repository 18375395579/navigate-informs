2012"Dominance-based Rough Set Approach permits inductive learning of a preference model from ordinal data consisting of exemplary decisions  (classifications or pairwise comparisons of objects). The model is a set of easily understandable “if? then…” decision rules. It  can be used to either justify past decisions, or predict future decisions, or develop a strategy of intervention. The rule model can represent more complex interactions among attributes than any utility function or binary relation."
