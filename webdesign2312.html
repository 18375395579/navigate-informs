2012"Our simulation-optimization approach integrates a stochastic integer programming (SIP) model for wildfire extended attack planning with DEVS-FIRE, a fire spread and suppression discrete event simulation model. The SIP model optimizes the location and timing of the deployment of firefighting resources to an escaped large-scale wildfire. The SIP decisions and weather forecasts are used in DEVS-FIRE to generate fire spread scenarios, which become input for the SIP model in the next decision period."
