2013"In semiconductor manufacturing, modeling crystal growth process is crucial for enhancing the initial quality of silicon ingots and all downstream productions. However, such a process modeling poses great challenges due to complex functional data structures. In this work, we propose a hierarchical logistic regression model to address this challenge. Both a simulation and a case study in a continuous crystal growth process are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
