2013"How long should a patient with a treatable chronic disease wait for more effective treatments before accepting the best available treatment? We explore this question as an optimal stopping problem using a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov Decision Process. We derive structural properties of the model, solve a three-period problem and present a numerical example of chronic hepatitis C optimal treatment adoption decisions."
