2013"We develop an optimization framework  to inform the design of vehicle sharing networks. The framework embeds an urban traffic simulation model, which provides a detailed description of how modal shifts impact both link and network-wide traffic metrics. We use the framework to identify locations for vehicle sharing stations that lead to maximal improvements in network-wide metrics."
