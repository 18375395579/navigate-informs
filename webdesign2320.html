2013"In this research, we employ the framework of institutional logics to examine the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) technology in the U.S. healthcare industry.  Complementary and conflicting institutional logics are examined from a systems perspective to evaluate implications for healthcare providers as they consider the adoption of EHR platforms.  Combining Institutional Logics with System Dynamics is used to examine the interplay of multiple institutional logics upon EHR adoption."
