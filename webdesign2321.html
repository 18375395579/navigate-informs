2006"We outline a new decomposition method for variational inequalities that represent a generalized Nash equilibrium, i.e., with constraints that link the Nash players.  The subproblems are ordinary optimization models, which, for many energy market models, are the starting point of the modelling process; this observation simplifies the process of defining the whole VI model.  We illustrate with a Nash-Cournot model of an electricity market."
