2006"The study team used an iterative approach, applying network transhipment modeling, simulation modeling, and logistics analysis to create and test the best distribution network configuration with results shown in a distribution blueprint format. We provide an overview of the distribution planning problem and a decision support methodology used to provide distribution asset placement, fleet sizing, and process improvements to logistics operations."
