2008"We consider the problem of a retailer managing a product category.  Products have different prices, costs and salvage value.   We consider various models of consumer choice: locational, one-step substitution as well as a very general model based on utilization maximization.  For cases in which we do not obtain the optimal solution we suggest efficient heuristics and test their performance numerically."
