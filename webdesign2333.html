2008"To better address the dynamic nature of complex stochastic systems, we develop a procedure to partition the time series and perform simulations in smaller intervals. Based on the simulation framework, a metaheuristic is designed for online optimization that integrates analytical models and offline experimental results, while still accounting for stochastic factors. The methodology is applied to the problem of emergency response logistics."
