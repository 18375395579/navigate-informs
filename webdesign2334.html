2013"We present a forecast-driven dynamic model that uses a combination of Decision Theory and stochastic programming for pre-positioning relief items in preparation for a foreseen hurricane. Our model uses forecast advisories issued every six hours by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to determine the best time for starting the pre-positioning activities, and the amount and location of units to be prepositioned; as new advisories are issued, it also repositions already prepositioned units."
