2007"Nonlinear stochastic dynamics of manufacturing systems leads to distinct recurrence behavior of system evolution. We present a local recurrence model for predicting throughputs in multistage manufacturing assembly lines. The model captures the nonstationarity as well as the nonlinearity of the dynamics, and yields around 35% performance improvement in the prediction of throughputs from a manufacturing system compared to any global predictor."
