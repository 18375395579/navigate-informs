2007"Using a new model of infection spread between contiguous heterogeneous communities we evaluate the implementation and timing of primarily non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. We also include changes in human behavior by introducing a feedback parameter into the model. We find, among other conclusions, that spatial quarantine and isolation strategies are unlikely to succeed."
