2008"It is by now a well appreciated fact that the purpose of reliability and life testing is to make coherent decisions. Utility is a key element of decision making. In this talk I propose a model for eliciting a decision maker's utility for reliability. The model is motivated by the Rasch Model of item response theory. I describe how the model can be invoked in practice and propose a statistical approach for estimating the model parameters. I conclude by presenting a real life case study."
