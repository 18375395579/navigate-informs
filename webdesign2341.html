2006"The objective of the research effort described in this presentation is to quantify the marginal impact of networking as part of an effort to evaluate the concept of network-centric operations. Specifically, this presentation analyzes networking concepts and uses simulation results from agent-based combat models to quantify and assess the marginal benefit of networking concepts with respect to warfighter effectiveness at the tactical level."
