2013"In this paper we present a general framework of a copulas-based dependent decision lattice approach for correlated uncertainties. The proposed dependent decision lattice model allows multiple dependent uncertainties with arbitrary marginal distributions to be represented in a recombining tree structure. This general framework significantly reduce the size of the tree for practical applications in decision analysis, real options valuations, and financial derivatives valuation."
