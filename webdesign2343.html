2008"We present a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model for initial response. We consider minimizing the cost of deploying firefighting resources to multiple bases plus the expected cost plus net value change (C + NVC) of dispatching the resources to multiple fire scenarios. A fire scenario is defined by daily occurrence and fire growth using FARSITE. A computational study using historical data from Texas Forest Service for a planning unit in East Texas will be presented."
