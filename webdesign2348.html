2013"Observing that patients with longer appointment delays tend to have higher no-show rates, many providers put a limit on how far into the future that an appointment can be scheduled. We study how such choices of appointment windows affect a provider’s operational efficiency. We consider two models. The first one assumes patients are homogeneous. The second model faces two types of patients differing in no-show and arrival rates, and the provider can use patient type-specific appointment windows."
