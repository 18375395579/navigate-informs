2008"Image registration is the problem of finding a geometric transformation between two images of the same area that preserves the spatial correspondence of image objects. Mutual information (MI) provides a method for measuring the mutual dependence of two random variables and it can be used as a similarity metric in image registration problems. The MI metric is studied and applied to the problem of registering infrared images to visible images."
