2012"We use detailed traffic and fuel models to address a fixed-time signal control problem for the Swiss city of Lausanne. We have developed an optimization framework with good short-term performance using a metamodel that combines information from the simulator and an analytical queuing model. The method is able to identify signal plans with improved travel times and energy consumption even under tight computational budgets."
