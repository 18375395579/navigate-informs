2007"Response modeling is concerned with identifying potential buyers  based on customers' demographic and behavioral data. However, there are many more non-responders than responders in the data set, resulting in low accuracy. Here, we investigate various customer data reconstruction methods for handling class imbalance in response modeling. An empirical study using a real customer data set is conducted."
