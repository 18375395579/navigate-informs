2008"The development of management strategies for contamination threats in water distribution systems can be informed through the use of a simulation-optimization framework. Agent-based and mechanistic models are coupled to capture the dynamic interactions between managers?operation decisions, consumers?water consumption choices and contaminant transport in the network for evaluating consumer exposure.  Optimization methods are applied to identify response plans to protect public health."
