2008"The purpose of this presentation is to report on research about the effects that facilitation-driven model uses have when strategic decision making groups engage in conflict management and influence behaviors. The presentation shall begin by framing the research questions. It will then explicate the methodological approach and the application of interaction analysis. In the last part we shall provide preliminary results of groups working on real life strategic problems (non-experimental)."
