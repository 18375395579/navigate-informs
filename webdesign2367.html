2006"We present a continuum approximation model for the Period Vehicle Routing Problem with Service Choice (PVRP-SC). The PVRP-SC is a variant of the Period Vehicle Routing Problem in which the visit frequency to nodes is a decision of the model.  This variation can result in more efficient vehicle tours and/or greater service benefit to customers. The model helps evaluate the value of service choice in the strategic and tactical planning of periodic distribution systems."
