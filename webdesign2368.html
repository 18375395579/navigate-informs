2007"Both climate change and technical change are uncertain. In this paper we combine economics and decision analysis to incorporate the uncertainty of technical change into climate change policy analysis. We present the results of an expert elicitation on the prospects for technological change in advanced solar. We combine the expert elicitations on the technology with a technologically detailed Integrated Assessment Model to derive a probability distribution over future abatement cost curves."
