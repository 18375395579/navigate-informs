2006"An effort is made to systematically investigate the best process conditions that ensure large-scale synthesis of different types of nanostructures. Models linking the probabilities of obtaining specific morphologies to the process variables are developed. A new iterative algorithm for fitting a Multinomial GLM is proposed and used. The optimum process conditions that are robust with respect to inner noise are derived from the fitted models using Monte-Carlo simulations."
