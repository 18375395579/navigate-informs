2008"Brand strength is derived from market based investments.  It has also been proposed that brand strength can be leveraged to enhance the productivity of marketing spend, resulting in superior performance.  No single study has examined a complete longitudinal model of the role of brand strength in brand performance. We examine these effects in the U.S. automotive market with a large data set spanning all major brands from 1997-2003, and based on over 40,000 observations."
