2012"We model the dynamic risk management problem for a commodity processor in a multi-period setting. We use a time-consistent risk measure based on the conditional value at risk (CVaR) and obtain the optimal operational and financial hedging policy in a partially complete market. We quantify the value of time-consistent decision making in terms of mean-risk tradeoff. We also quantify the value of excess procurement and processing capacities as operational hedging levers."
