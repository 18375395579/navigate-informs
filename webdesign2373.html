2007"Limit standards have been defined as probabilistic requirements that specify confidence on the maximum proportion of simulation runs yielding values of an output variable above or below a desired threshold.  Typical analysis methods utilize the binomial distribution.  This research investigates the relationship between the binomial and beta distributions, and develops a Bayesian sequential approach to analysis of limit standards."
