2006"This paper developed a DOE-based automatic process control scheme considering both observation and modeling uncertainties. The simulation demonstrates that considering the uncertainties, automatic controllers can achieve better process performance than conventional off-line design, and more stable than normal APC controllers. The proposed approach is illustrated using an industrial process."
