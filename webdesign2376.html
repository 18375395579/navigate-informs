2012"In telecommunication network design problems, survivability and reliability are used to evaluate quality of service. In this study, a new metric that combines network reliability with network resilience is presented to measure reliability/survivability more effectively. It is compared with well-known network reliability/survivability metrics, namely k-connectivity and two terminal reliability, and its benefits and computational efficiency are discussed."
