2013"Social networking sites are a source of public opinion on a wide range of topics from consumer products to politics. We examine Twitter content up to and during the firing of Joe Paterno and subsequent riots. We apply existing methods of sentiment analysis and suggest how metadata and information from the structure of social networks can be used to construct and enhance sentiment indicators. We test performance using standard tools from time-series and systems analysis."
