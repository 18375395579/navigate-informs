2007"Previous work on profile monitoring of nonlinear profiles has assumed that the measurements within a profile are uncorrelated. We propose the use of a nonlinear mixed model (NLMM) to account for the correlation structure. Our approach results in charts with good abilities to detect changes in Phase I data."
