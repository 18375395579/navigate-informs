2008"Many companies experience nonstationary demand due to product lifecycle effects, seasonality, customer buying patterns, or other factors.  We present a practical model for managing inventory in a supply chain facing stochastic, nonstationary demand.  Our model is based on the guaranteed service modeling framework.  We first describe how inventory levels should adapt to changes in demand at a single stage.  We then show how nonstationary demand propagates in a supply chain, allowing us to link stages and apply a multiechelon optimization algorithm originally designed for stationary demand.  We describe two successful applications of this model.  The first is a strategic project to evaluate the benefits of an inventory pool at Case New Holland (CNH).  The second is a tactical implementation to support monthly safety stock planning at Microsoft."
