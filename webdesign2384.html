2008"We study the optimal capacity sizing problem for a M/M/N+G system. In a large system setting, we observe that under the optimal operating regime intricately depends on the abandonment distribution. In particular, for many common distributions, the optimal regime has a traffic intensity greater than 1. We propose a fluid based solution and demonstrate its efficacy via simulations."
