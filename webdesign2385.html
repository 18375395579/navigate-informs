2007"We illustrate the use of acceptance sampling by attributes (ASA) to probabilistic requirements verification using Monte Carlo simulation. Given the required probability of attaining a specified limit and the required confidence that this probability is achieved, ASA can determine a family of appropriate (n,c) sampling plans.  We illustrate how this approach to statistical inference can be implemented with an example from aerospace engineering."
