2008"We demonstrate the use of the Java Simulation Library (JSL) through the entire process of optimizing a supply-chain simulation model.  We introduce the unique features of the JSL and its useful framework for supply-chain, transportation logistics, and inventory modeling.  We next outline the statistical features of the JSL and how they facilitate simulation-based optimization.  Finally, we discuss oppurtunities for users to easily extend existing simulation-based optimization capabilities."
