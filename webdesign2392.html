2012"In this research, we seek adaptive treatment strategies for interdisciplinary pain management using data from the Eugene McDermott Center for Pain Management at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.  An adaptive dynamic programming approach is formulated to improve current and future pain outcomes. Outcome and state transition modeling handle the problem of endogeneity via an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach."
