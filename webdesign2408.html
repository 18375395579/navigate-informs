2007"We present a game-theoretic model of interdomain routing in today's Internet. The model enables complex dynamic interactions between the agents (asynchronous, sequential, and based on partial-information). We provide realistic conditions that guarantee that greedy and myopic behaviour is in the best interest of each of the players."
