2012"A methodology is proposed to supplement the subjective “value?of intelligence with an objective metric of “impact?of intelligence on network models.  This metric would measure the impact of a piece of intelligence on a network’s metric, being used to answer analyst intelligence questions or gain insight on a network.  Our methodology suggests that on an intelligence driven network, each document can bring information in the form of unique links and nodes which can be measured quantitatively."
