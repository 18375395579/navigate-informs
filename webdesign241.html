2006"We propose a tradeoff model of intertemporal choice that draws on an attribute-based process, in which options are first compared on the attributes of timing and outcome magnitude, the two comparisons are then weighted against one another, and the option favored by this process is chosen.  Using elementary principles and few parameters we account for the major anomalies in intertemporal choice.  We test the model on several data sets and show that it outperforms existing models."
