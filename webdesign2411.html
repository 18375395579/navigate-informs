2006"In this talk, we present a dynamic system optimal (DSO) model to identify routes and schedules to evacuate affected populations to safety zones in the event of natural disasters or terrorist attacks. The DSO model embeds the cell transmission model for traffic flow representation and considers departure time as one of the decisison variables. To reduce the computational cost for solving the DSO, a heuristic solution approach is proposed to provide a close approximation of system optimum."
