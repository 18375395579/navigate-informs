2008"Consider situations in which the sample used for process monitoring consists of an individual unit. Our motivation comes from gamma regression model-based control charts for flu activity, where individual units are absolute values of residuals. We have developed probability statements for computing true errors associated with individuals control charts of continuously distributed measurements. Assuming simple cost functions, we have searched for and discovered economic designs."
