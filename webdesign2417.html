2008"This study presents an application of logistic regression, and support vector machines to the analysis of scalp electroencephalograms obtained from epilepsy patients implanted with the Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) used in VNS Therapy. The separation quality for Local Lyapunov Exponents is studied as a potential electroencephalographic marker of optimal VNS stimulation parameters."
