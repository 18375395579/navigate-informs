2008"We have been partnering with CSX Transportation to develop several locomotive-related  models. These models include: Locomotive Planning Optimizer (which determines an optimal locomotive plan), Locomotive Simulation Optimizer (which simulates the locomotive movement across the railroad network), and Real-Time Locomotive Shop Router (which sends locomotives to shops for quarterly maintenances). This presentation will give an overview of these models and their computational results."
