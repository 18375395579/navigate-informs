2012"The concept of Granger-Causality has been broadly regarded as a powerful method, and widely used in time series research to determine a predictability of one variable to the others. However, one of the limitations of Granger-Causality is linearity assumption. In this presentation, we introduce a methodology to identify causal relationship of variables based on nonlinearity assumption and graph theory. A prediction application using nonlinear causality graph is also presented."
