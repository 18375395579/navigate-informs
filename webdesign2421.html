2006"Microarrays continue to evolve as a powerful tool for assessing the expression levels of genes in DNAs. Noise in microarray data is considered to be a major hindrance to a significant number of impending breakthroughs in medical treatment and drug discovery. We discuss a multiresolution analysis based denoising approach using dual tree complex wavelet transform."
