2013"We provide a case study to demonstrate the values of incident ticket analysis for a type   of IT services that supports application implementation, application help desk,   application maintenance and support, and application monitoring.  An incident ticket   is a record of services for dealing with failures, errors, or any troubles   with an application. Goals of ticket analysis include assessment of the quality of service,   assessment of workload, and identification of root causes."
