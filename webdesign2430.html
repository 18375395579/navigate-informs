2013"We present a simple framework for estimating quantile sensitivities by infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA). We also consider the likelihood ratio (LR) and weak derivative (WD) methods, and discuss the strengths and weakness of each method.  Simulation experiments are used to compare the performances of the three methods."
