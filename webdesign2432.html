2012"Some applications of Bayesian ideas in healthcare fraud detection will be presented. The emphasis will be on the use of Bayesian co-clustering and link analysis methodologies to identify billing patterns of potentially fraudulent providers who submit a large number of high-dollar claims submitted to healthcare insurance programs for reimbursement. Alternative Bayesian frameworks for modelling sample-based audits of healthcare related payments and overpayment situations will also be discussed."
