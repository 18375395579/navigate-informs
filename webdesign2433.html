2012"A time-series model is constructed to predict surges in turnout at mass immunization clinics during influenza pandemics. Variables include media coverage, weather conditions, day of the week, and estimated weekly infection rate. The model is based on Toronto clinic turnout data during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009."
