2008"e study the stationary buffer content of a Brownian queue whose parameters depend on an external independent Markov process.  According to the literature by using martingale techniques such a problem reduces to a matrix identity that can be solved by finding an ad-hoc system of equations.   We use the theory of Matrix Polynomial to go further in this analysis and give a simplified expression for the system of equations together with general conditions that assure the existence of a solution."
