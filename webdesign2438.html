2008"Public transit system can be used during no-notice disasters to evacuate transit-dependent citizens to safety. This paper describes a framework to model the problem, and presents a Tabu search approach to identify routes for transit vehicles. The objective is to maximize the number of transit dependent citizens evacuated within a short time-frame. The traffic network of the city of Fort Worth, TX is used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework."
