2007"In this talk, we will discuss the feature selection in a real metabolomic data set. There are two kinds of correlations in this data set: the correlation between different observations (NMR spectra) due to the repeated measure, and the local correlation between different chemical features within observations (NMR spectra). To take into account both correlations, we propose to combine longitudinal data analysis with multiple testing procedures to select significant metabolite features."
