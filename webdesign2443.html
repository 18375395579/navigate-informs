2007"We study the numerical solution of optimization problems, in which the time required to compute a function value may vary greatly within the domain.  Our approach applies a surrogate-based mesh adaptive direct search algorithm, in which surrogates are based on previously stored CPU times, rather than objective function values.  Examples come from industrial problems, including one that requires a hydrodynamic simulation and an image registration process for each function evaluation."
