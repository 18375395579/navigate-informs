2008"We report on a problem of dynamic assignment of cross-trained agents in an environment of on-demand technical support services. The general, high-fidelity model is intractable; however, stylized models, analysis, and heuristics are useful in developing effective policies for managing these systems. In addition to information technology delivery/support systems, this research is relevant to many domains including healthcare."
