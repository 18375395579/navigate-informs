2008"Traffic signal inventory has traditionally revolved around identifying faulty equipment and nonconformance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). This paper illustrates how a traffic signal inventory program can be performed using ArcGIS?software, enabling municipalities to better identify and plan for maintenance needs and future signal equipment changes. Performing a signal inventory also can help prepare for conformance to evolving Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and MUTCD requirements, for which new proposed traffic signal requirements, such as the use of countdown pedestrian signal heads with a 10-year compliance phase-in period, are expected. Using the Signal Inventory Project in Taunton, Massachusetts, as a case study, the paper elaborates on why a traffic signal inventory was helpful, why ArcGIS?was leveraged to aid in the inventory data gathering, how the inventory was performed, the reports generated by the inventory, and lessons learned in using ArcGIS? Having used GIS at the starting point for project planning and execution, this application led to cost and time savings for Taunton, by creating an effective, efficient data collection and reporting process."
