2012"US Department of Energy has identified pyrolysis platform as a promising biofuel pathway. In this paper, we present a biofuel supply chain model with Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) methodology to investigate the facility location, facility capacity and gasoline distribution decisions in operational level for corn stover in US Midwest. By analyzing the unit production and transportation cost for gasoline, we are able to show that it is promising to use corn stove to produce gasoline."
