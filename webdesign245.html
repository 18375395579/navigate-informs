2007"In this research we provide a framework for integrating two stages of Radiation Treatment Planning (RTP): Beam Angle Selection (BAS) and Dose Optimization (DO). A metaheuristic approach, Nested Partitions (NP), is applied. Computational efficiency is achieved by utilizing High-Throughput Computing (HTC) via the Condor system. Computational results show that our framework has led to a significant improvement in terms of solution quality and delivery time comparing with current clinic practices."
