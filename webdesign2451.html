2013"Mixtures of continuous distributions can approximate different probability distributions. This paper suggests computationally efficient methods for  constructing mixtures of distributions, based on the minimization of weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and CVaR-distance between CDFs of an empirical distribution and the mixture. A special attention is paid to fitting tails of the distribution. Proposed techniques are exemplified with fitting the distribution of an aircraft manufacturer errors."
