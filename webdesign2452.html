2012"In this study we work with Pittsburgh Community Food Bank (GPCFB) to improve their operations. We particularly focus on GPCFB’s VRP, which has not been studied before, and evaluate three different approaches to solve this problem: MIP-based column generation, exact CP-based model and heuristic CP- based model. Our computational results indicate that the heuristic CP-based model can yield substantial savings even when a small number of changes (locations) are considered."
