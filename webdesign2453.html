2013"This research addresses the challenge of allocating resources for inspection data acquisition for complex systems with multiple components and failure modes such as a military gas turbine engine.  A nested loop approach using is proposed to determine the system’s mean time to failure distribution and a metaheuristics was used to identify the optimal inspection data to be added at each subcomponent. This methodology can be applied to assess the economic impact of changing maintenance policies."
