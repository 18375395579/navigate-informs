2007"Network and behavioral characteristics are exploited looking for opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of a behavior-consistent traffic routing framework while testing the sensitivity of the model to the use of different control paradigms. Different information-based control paradigms are formulated and experiments are conducted to compare the effectiveness and stability of the behavior-consistent framework."
