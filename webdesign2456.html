2013"Supersparse Linear Integer Models (SLIM) are highly interpretable classification models that only require users to add, subtract and multiply a few meaningful numbers in order to generate a prediction. In this work, we show how to create SLIM scoring systems using mixed-integer programming, and present experimental results to show that these scoring systems are both accurate and sparse in comparison to state-of-the-art classification models."
