2007"In this paper, we study the problem of modeling the discrete customer choice behavior. We propose a model based on the concept of preference order. Using this model as an input, we propose a stochastic programming model to determine the resource allocation and solve it considerably fast. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our method, including the comparison with the independent demands resource allocation model."
