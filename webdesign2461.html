2006"We consider how to identify important factors influencing a response in a simulation experiment, where the number of factors is large and factors can affect both dispersions and means; the directions of the effects being known. We present a method using a polytope construction that efficiently makes use of all available information to estimate both dispersion and mean effects. Numerical examples are given showing its improved performance compared with sequential bifurcation."
