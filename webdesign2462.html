2008"This talk presents a novel approach that identifies the top-k (the k most reliable) units in a fleet using sensor-based prognostic information.  The proposed Prognostics-Based Ranking Algorithm (PBR-Algorithm) combines prognostics-based stochastic degradation models with state-of-the-art computer science based database ranking algorithms."
