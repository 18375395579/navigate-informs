2012"One of the most critical challenges in national security is the detection of a nuclear or radiological weapon in the midst of common radioactive materials.  Large quantities of radiation measurement data have been collected and are being used to develop radiation threat assessment capabilities.  But for the most part they are missing a critical component: the threats!  We describe a broad range of threat models and threat injection techniques and tools that can be used to complete the dataset."
