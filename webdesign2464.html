Yueyue Fan, Associate Professor, University of California-Davis, One Shield Ave., Davis, CA, United States of America, yyfan@ucdavis.edu"
2013"In this talk, we will present a network model that captures the spatial interdependence of existing power supply and demand.  This model will be used to evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of increasing EV demand in a California case study."
