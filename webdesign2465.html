2007"This work presents a novel approach of deep packet inspection by using algorithmic complexity for classification of packet content. Complexity is inherently incomputable however measures for approximating complexity are available. Complexity is computed for packet payload to classify them as benign or malicious. Intrusion data from the 1999 DARPA dataset is used for validation of the approach. This measure that may be useful for detection of previously unknown attacks."
