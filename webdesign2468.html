2006"Winner's curse is a property of common-value auctions where the winner overbids if he bids his truthful value. To avoid over-bidding, bidders must shade their bid. Bid shading has been investigated empirically by several authors. We show that the current test, a regression model that uses only bids from the auction end, has several shortcomings. Our proposed method is based on a functional representation of an auction. It better captures the data structure and models bid dynamics directly."
