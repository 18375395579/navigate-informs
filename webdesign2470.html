2007"This paper presents a surrogate model for compliant assembly processes. The proposed modeling technique uses a limited number of samples from a computationally expensive model and approximates the relationship between the product quality and process design parameters, such as fixture layout, or joining schemes. Because of its analytical form and low computational cost, the surrogate model can be used for design optimization and analysis. A case study is used to illustrate the procedure."
