2008"Performance evaluation of increasingly complex human-made systems requires the use of simulation models, which are difficult to describe and capture by succinct mathematical models. Ordinal optimization is developed to address the difficulties of the optimization of complex systems via simulation models or other computation-intensive models involving possible stochastic effects and discrete choices. We review this approach, the ordinal comparison and goal softening ideas involved, in this talk."
