2006"In this talk, we describe novel optimization-based predictive models, and analyze the process of selecting critical attributes through a feature-selection algorithm. Applications to prediction of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, human cancer, and the degree of cell membrane permeabilization via assisted ultrasound (for drug delivery) will be discussed."
