2013"We present a new choice model that is a simultaneous approximation for all random utility based discrete choice models including the multinomial logit, the probit, the nested logit and mixtures of multinomial logit models. Our model is based on a new primitive for substitution behavior where substitution from one product to another is modeled as a state transition of a Markov chain. We show that the choice probabilities computed by our model are a good approximation to the true choice probabilities for any random utility based choice model under mild conditions (exact for the MNL). We also show that  assortment optimization can be solved in polynomial time. Numerical observations suggest that the average maximum relative error is less than 3%."
