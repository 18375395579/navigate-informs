2012"Fault detection and root cause identification are both important tasks in Multivariate Statistical Process Control. This paper proposes a Variable-Selection-based MEWMA chart. The new chart first locates potentially out-of-control variables via variable selection, and then deploys such information in the monitoring statistics with the reduction in dimensionality providing increased sensitivity to out-of-control conditions. Its performance is studied via numerical simulations and real examples."
