2007"Health savings accounts (HSAs) have been touted as a way to control rising healthcare costs. We develop a Markov healthcare cost prediction model based on a household's previous year cost percentile. The model is used to simulate a household's health savings account balance over time to determine the contribution levels necessary to reliably cover all future healthcare expenses. Cost prediction performance and HSA simulation results are presented."
