2013"We allow for both a correlated prior distribution on the means (e.g., with kriging models) and sampling correlation (e.g., with CRN) in discrete optimization via simulation. These two correlations are brought together for the first time in a highly-sequential knowledge-gradient sampling algorithm, which chooses points to sample using a Bayesian value of information criterion, and lead to improved optimization performance in problems with a combinatorial number of alternatives and costly samples."
