2013"In this paper, we propose a method to improve the quality of recommendations made using association rules. This is accomplished by combining rules when possible using a technique strongly grounded in probability theory. Combining rules requires identification of the best combination of rules. We use a maximum-likelihood framework to compare alternative combinations. We empirically show that our proposed approach performs better than several existing rule based and non-rule based approaches."
