2012"Efficient allocation of HIV prevention and treatment funds is crucial but decision makers do not have good tools to support such decision making.  We developed the Resource Allocation for Control of HIV (REACH) model, a planning tool for use by regional and country-level decision makers in evaluating potential resource allocations.  We describe the model, present example analyses for three different settings, and describe our ongoing work in further developing and applying the model."
