2008"As a hurricane approaches the coastline, its state variables are updated periodically via satellite, airplane and other reconnaissance.  Each update represents a stage, a decision making epoch, in Bellman's parlance.  Stage-to-stage updates are uncertain, reflecting the probabilistic behavior of hurricanes.  We characterize on-shore decision-making within such a stochastic dynamic programming framework, and replay old hurricanes to demonstrate the utility of the approach."
