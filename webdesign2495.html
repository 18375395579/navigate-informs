2012"We develop efficient Monte Carlo methods for estimating American option sensitivities. A generalized infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) approach introduced to resolve the difficulty caused by discontinuity of the optimal decision with respect to the underlying parameter. In contrast to the conventional IPA method, we find that the pathwise differentiability is not necessary for the application of our generalized IPA. Numerical implementation and error analysis are also discussed."
