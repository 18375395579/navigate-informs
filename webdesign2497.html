2006"Spatial defect patterns on semiconductor wafers contain useful information about potential problems in the manufacturing processes. This study proposes to use model-based clustering via Bayesian inference for detecting defect patterns. The new clustering method detects the defect clusters and identifies the pattern of each cluster automatically. Promising results are obtained through simulation studies."
