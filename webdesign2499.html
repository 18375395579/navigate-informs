2006"Many process controllers rely on good process models that are seldom available for many complex large-scale nonlinear engineering systems fraught with uncertainties. Even with good models, the issue becomes the speed of execution during online applications, which ultimately forces model simplification and resultant suboptimal control. Hence, there is a need for model free approaches, which can dynamically and efficiently predict the uncertainties, and provide a path for optimal control."
