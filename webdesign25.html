2012"Presolve refers to that step before solution of an optimization model in which an attempt is made to simplify a model.   For LPs these simplifications remove “extraneous?parts of the model, but for MIPs  the changes can be more fundamental, producing a strengthened model, and this strengthening can make the difference between a model being solvable and hopeless.  We will examine Gurobi presolve, including the effects of some of the more interesting new reductions."
