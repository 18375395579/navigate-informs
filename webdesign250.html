2012"We present an on-line, fast and recursive non-parametric function approximation technique that does not require storage of data stream. The unique collection of these features is essential for modeling large data sets where storage of data becomes prohibitively expensive or updated information arrives. This design leads to an efficient way of value function approximation in the context of approximate dynamic programming for stochastic resource allocation in the presence of exogenous information."
