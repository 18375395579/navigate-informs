2013"We quantify risks in imported foods using data on food import violations from the FDA. We find that the rate of import violations per volume is a useful indicator of import risk. Furthermore, we model food import risk as a function of country of origin, product type, and key economic indicators using regression analysis. The results elucidate both product & country risks, and indicate that import risk is significantly related to both product type and economic status of the country of origin."
