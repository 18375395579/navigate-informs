Dynamic model supporting vendors with time axis are not always crisp rather involve a high degree of fuzziness and uncertainty in the real life situation. This paper proposes a dynamic model with uncertainty based on Fuzzy AHP for long-term strategic vendor selection problems. The selection of partnership supplier is thus illustrated by our methodology."
