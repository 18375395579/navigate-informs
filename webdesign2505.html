2012"This paper considers statistical process control (SPC) of univariate  processes when the parametric form of the process distribution is   unavailable. We propose a new framework for constructing nonparametric control charts, by first categorizing observed data and then applying categorical data analysis methods to SPC. Some new nonparametric control charts are proposed and they are compared with several   representative existing control charts in various cases."
