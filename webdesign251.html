2012"Production cycle time is an important performance measure, and it is of interest to characterize its distributional properties comprehensively. This article proposes a non-linear quantile regression model for the relationship between stationary cycle time quantiles and the throughput rates of a manufacturing system. The statistical properties of the estimated cycle time quantiles are investigated and the impact of dependent data from simulation output on parameter estimations is analyzed."
