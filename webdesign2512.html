2006"Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM) is a widely used model in multi-level criteria decision making. In this paper, an algorithm of sensitivity analysis is developed to determine the allowable ranges within which perturbations can be induced on values at different levels of the hierarchy without changing the original ranking of the decision alternatives, sensitivity coefficient of contribution vectors on different levels of the hierarchy, and the critical criteria for keeping current ranking."
