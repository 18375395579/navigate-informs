2007"First year results are presented of research to develop hardware and software to support time-to-failure (TTF) predictions for internal combustion engines.  A long-life battery-powered sensor wireless relays vibration measurements and in-situ IR spectroscopy on oil.  Novel algorithms use the combined sensor info to determine point estimates and uncertainty bounds for TTF and probabilistic estimates of likely failure modes.  A highly reliable monolithic silicon end-state is sought."
