2013"We are interested in maximizing a general function where observations are noisy and may be expensive. We derive a knowledge gradient policy, which chooses measurements which maximize the expected value of information, while using a locally parametric belief model which uses linear approximations with radial basis functions. Our technique accounts for correlation within adjacent subsets of the alternatives and does not pose any a priori assumption on the global shape of the underlying function."
