2013"We focus on combining subjective probabilities in aviation safety.  We used Subject Matter Experts in probability elicitation for separate risk assessment models.  A composite model requires combining subjective probabilities.  We proposed three probability combining protocols: Rational Combination is inspired by the Expected Utilization Theory; Irrational Combination is inspired by Prospect Theory; Realistic Combination involves using the results of the individual models selected to combine."
