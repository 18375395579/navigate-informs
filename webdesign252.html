2006"customer’s purchasing power. We formalize the notion of customer wallet and present several new predictive modeling approaches that estimate the unobserved customer wallets in a quantile regression framework. The objective is to estimate a quantile of the conditional distribution of the response, rather than the mean. We survey some of the traditional approaches for quantile modeling and propose adaptations of nearest-neighbor and regression-tree approaches to quantile modeling."
