2013"Many service systems use case managers who have repeated interactions with each customer until service is completed (e.g., emergency department doctors, social workers). We propose a stochastic model of a case manager system and formulate models that provide performance bounds for the system. We examine interactions among system parameters, including the impact on system performance of setting case-load limits. We also investigate heuristics for setting these limits."
