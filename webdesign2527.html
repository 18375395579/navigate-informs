2007"We describe defender-attacker-defender (DAD) models for protecting an electrical power grid physical infrastructure.  We first discuss the attacker-defender (AD) problem as one of interdiction: Use limited attacks on system components to maximize energy disruption. The DAD model uses limited defensive resources to protect components: We interdict the interdictor.  We discuss decomposition techniques to solve realistic electric power-transmission instances of AD, and smaller instances of DAD."
