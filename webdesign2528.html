2012"In my work, dynamic consumption models are studied for finite and infinite time Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems with fluctuating purchasing costs. I use additive general and exponential utility functions with finite and infinite time horizons. In addition, we assume that purchasing costs follow a discrete-state Markov chain. Then, I consider parametric sensitivity analysis for the model parameters using super-modularity."
