2013"We consider the capacitated assortment optimization problem where each product has a given weight and there is a capacity constraint on the assortment. We present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the capacitated assortment problem for a large family of choice models including the MNL model, Nested logit model, and the mixture of constant number of MNL models. We also show that the capacitated assortment optimization is NP-hard even for the special case ofMNL model."
