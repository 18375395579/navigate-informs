2012"The U.S. Office of Border Patrol is investigating how pattern and trend analysis and systematic randomness can be used to position border security resources. This study examined how approaches that combine these two techniques yield higher interdiction rates than approaches using either technique alone, and it identifies circumstances in which combined approaches are competitive with perfect surveillance."
