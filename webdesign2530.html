2012"Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool that stipulates the financial responsibility of producers for post-use handling of their products. In this research, we provide an analytical assessment of the potential of the widely-adopted collective EPR implementations for providing design incentives and generating economic benefits for the involved stakeholders via designing cost allocation mechanisms, using a network model of e-waste collection and recycling operations."
