2007"This talk describes a method that uses aggregate ratings provided by various segments of users for various categories of items to derive better estimations of unknown individual ratings. This is achieved by converting the aggregate ratings into constraints on the parameters of a selected rating estimation model.  It is shown that these additional constraints reduce rating estimation errors resulting in better rating estimations."
