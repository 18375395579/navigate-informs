2013"We study the optimal supply management problem for the manager of a renewable aquifer.  The manager must determine the optimal level of water transfers between municipalities and investment in water production technology. Using a stylized model, we determine the optimal policy for a profit or welfare-maximizing manager, and compare their impacts using the Triple Bottom Line framework. We obtain managerial insights and draw implications for policy related to sustainable water management."
