2013"Current implementations of Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) use greedy-type heuristics to select patterns to form a classification model. We present a network flow based approach to identify significant patterns to generate an LAD model. Our approach allows the user-specified requirements such as statistical significance, Hamming  distance, homogeneity, hazard ratio and/or prevalence of patterns. We present experiments on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method."
