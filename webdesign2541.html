2012"This award is given annually to the best decision analysis article or book published in the second preceding calendar year (i.e. calendar year 2010 for consideration in 2012). The intent of the award is to recognize the best publication in "decision analysis, broadly defined." This includes, but is not limited to, theoretical work on decision analysis methodology (including behavioral decision making and non-expected utility theory), descriptions of applications, and experimental studies."
