2006"Two existing influence diagram (ID) models -- discrete ID’s and mixtures of truncated exponentials (MTE) ID’s -- are compared to an extension of MTE ID’s.  This new model -- the continuous decision MTE ID -- develops more precise decision strategies for continuous decision variables and marginalizes continuous decision variables from the model by replacing them with deterministic chance nodes."
