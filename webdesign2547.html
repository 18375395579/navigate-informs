2012"A set of electronic direction finders is used by the military to locate the source of radio frequencies emitted on the battlefield by enemy forces.  In modern warfare, it is crucial to detect the enemy as early as possible to gain advantage.  This paper describes a new formulation to prescribe the deployment (i.e., location) of direction finders that maximizes the effectiveness with which emitters can be detected using a resource-constrained shortest path model."
