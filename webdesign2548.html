2012"This talk investigates the inverse Gaussian (IG) process as an effective model of degradation processes. We have shown that the IG process has a clear physical interpretation for modeling monotone degradations. Its close relationship with the Wiener process promotes several different approaches to account for heterogeneity commonly observed in degradations. The broad applicability of the IG process in degradation modeling is demonstrated using several real world examples."
