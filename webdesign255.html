2013"Prisons of the former Soviet Union have high rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and are thought to drive general population TB epidemics. Effective prison case detection, through employing more expensive technologies, may reduce long-term treatment costs and slow transmission. We develop a dynamic transmission model of TB matched to the epidemiology and costs in prisons, and we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of eight strategies for TB screening and diagnosis."
