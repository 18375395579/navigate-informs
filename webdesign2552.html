2006"The United States Commercial Aviation Partnership (USCAP) created a large spreadsheet model using systems dynamics, queueing models, and econometrics to encompass the entire US commercial aviation industry including travelers, airlines, airports, airline suppliers, airport suppliers, government agencies, and travel and tourism entities.
