2007"Electricity market structure is still under design. Market participants are challenged to adapt to changes in the environment. Efforts propose game theory models and evolutionary learning approaches to emulate market participant behaviors. We show data mining to switch between learning schemes.  Strategies between companies are modeled. Each firm predicts current and future conditions. Switching criterion between different models seeks to guarantee maximum expected profit over future time horizon. Each scheme is compared with participants that use only one learning scheme."
