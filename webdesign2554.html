2008"The FAA uses computer models to quantify the impact of planned investments on the performance of the National Airspace System (NAS).  NASPAC, the principle system-wide model in use, is a discrete-event simulation which represents the NAS as a network of airport and airspace queues.  The authors present the results of a simulation study of the projected benefits to NAS users of the Operational Evolution Partnership (OEP), the Agency’s modernization plan."
