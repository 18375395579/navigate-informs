2007"We developed a lane-group based anisotropic mesoscopic simulation model for interrupted traffic (AMS-I). The AMS-I model explicitly considers the driver's anticipation of signals and the flow interruptions caused by signals. Both analytical and computational analysis conducted on shockwave propagation and flow discharges under various timing configurations are presented."
