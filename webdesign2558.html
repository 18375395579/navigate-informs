2012"The objective of our research is to model and analyze the process of partnership creation, length of partnership efficacy, and timing of partnerships conclusion in networks of agencies responding to crises. We plan to create models using game theory and simulation to explore how characteristics of partnerships could be used to predict dynamics in agency investment, commitment length, partnership selection, and exit timing from a crisis."
