2007"Increasingly, successful drug development depends not only on regulatory approval, but also the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. We use a decision analytic model to determine the cost-effectiveness of statins in patients with rheumatoid arthritis based on a phase II study. Value of information analysis is performed to calculate the value of parameter uncertainty and inform on the design of the multi-centre follow up study."
