2013"We estimate a model of airline passenger choice using grouped booking data and least squares regression rather than the standard approach based on individual booking data and maximum likelihood estimation. We adapt the little-known and somewhat forgotten transformation techniques proposed by Berkson (1944) and Theil (1969) while correcting for heteroskedasticity using weighted least squares. We illustrate how to apply the methodology for RM applications for data grouped by path and fare class."
