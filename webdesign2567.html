2012"The objective of this research is to apply the failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) and graph theory to predict and prevent disruptions in supply chain networks. A network may be disrupted due to node failures. A node represents a supplier, customer, or transportation route. This research applies graph theory to model supply chain networks and uses the FMECA to identify critical nodes. A case study of a construction supply chain is analyzed to validate the methodology."
