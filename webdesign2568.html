2013"This paper examines the formation and evolution of teams in new scientific fields. We propose five mechanisms that affect the likelihood of co-authorship in a scientific team.  We model the effects of these mechanisms by developing a hybrid simulation model and we compare its results with statistics from the observed longitudinal co-authorship network. This paper presents a first application of hybrid models in research examining the evolution of new scientific fields via the emergence of teams."
