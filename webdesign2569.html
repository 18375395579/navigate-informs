2012"Value Focused Metrics (VFM) was developed based upon Ralph Keeney’s book, Value Focused Thinking.  VFM uses Fundamental Objectives Hierarchies supported by Means Ends Objective Networks as in Keeney's work.  Networks are represented as Bayesian and the metrics are identified for outcomes, outputs and inputs thus giving a complete system.  The result is an Influence Diagram that can be used to integrate metrics across the levels of the process or as an analytic tool for what if analysis."
