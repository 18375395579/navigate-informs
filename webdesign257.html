2013"We investigate variation and accuracy of new light-duty vehicle market share predictions for multinomial, mixed and nested logit models over a variety of utility function specifications. We find that the predictions of the best models outperform random guessing yet retain substantial error, share predictions are sensitive to the presence of utility covariates but less sensitive to the form, and models selected for best fit have comparable forecast error to those with the best forecasts."
