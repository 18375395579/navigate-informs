2006"We present a large scale empirical study on the effect of stock-outs on demand. Using a unique, proprietary data set, we measure specifically what percentages of demand are lost, back-ordered, or substituted to other SKUs. We present and evaluate various estimation models, including a store level estimation method and a consumer level estimation models."
