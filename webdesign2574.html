2006"A comparison between Multi-Trailers, Automated Guided Vehicles and Automated Lifting Vehicles used for inter terminal transport is given. The evaluation is based on the number of containers arriving too late at their destination versus the amount of equipment needed in this respect. The analysis gives insight into the importance of the different characteristics of the transport systems and their interaction with the handling equipment."
