2007"When conducting time-course microarray experiments, one is  usually interested in measuring time relative to some biological  process of interest.  But, it is often difficult to measure this "biological" time accurately.  Such temporal uncertainty  negatively impacts both the accuracy and power of data analysis.  In this talk, I will describe a method for handling temporal uncertainty based on the premise that microarray data itself can be used to refine our estimates of "biological" time."
