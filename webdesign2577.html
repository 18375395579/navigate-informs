2007"A new Eulerian-Lagrangian Cell Transmission Model for air traffic flow  is developed on a graph-theoretic network flow model constructed from  historical air traffic data. The predictive capabilities of the model  are successfully validated against recorded air traffic data. A large-scale optimization problem of controlling sector aircraft  counts over the National Airspace System is posed as a Mixed Integer  Linear Program. The problem is solved using dual decomposition method."
