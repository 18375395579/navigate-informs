" 3 - Extensible Simulation Framework for Railyard Operations"
David Ciemnoczolowski, Union Pacific Railroad, DDCIEMNO@UP.COM"
2008"Simulation provides an excellent framework for analyzing impacts  of operational rules, yard design, and service design.  Unfortunately,  railyard operations do not readily fit into the classic server/queue  network typically assumed in discrete-event simulation.  In this talk, we will outline an extensible simulation approach using plug-in modules to evaluate different control policies."
