2007"This work focuses on combining observations from field experiments with detailed computer simulations of a physical process. This typically involves calibration of parameters in the simulator and accounting for inadequate physics. We consider physical applications for which the field data and simulator output are multivariate and several sources of data are available.  We illustrate the proposed methodology with experimental data and simulations that inform on the k-L fluid instability model."
