2012"We analyze patient flow data for 400 patients collected at a family medicine practice in Massachusetts. We then present an stochastic integer programming model to schedule appointments to minimize a weighted combination of patient waiting and provider idle time. The model sequences patient types with different nurse and physician time requirements and staggers their appointment start times appropriately while keeping the basic slot structure used by the schedulers at the practice."
