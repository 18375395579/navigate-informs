2012"We proposes a graph-theoretical approach to model the information network which results from wireless connections of equipped vehicles in a traffic network through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. This study presents metrics based on social network analysis to understand structural characteristics and dynamics of the information network. Further, based on simulation experiments, we discuss the results and an approach to explore the structural evolution of the information network over time."
