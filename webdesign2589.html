2013"Traditionally, a NGO raises funds from donors before implementing the project. This exposes the donors to a high level of uncertainty,  resulting in challenges for the NGO to raise funds. In contrast, some NGOs have moved towards outcome based funding where a NGO implements the project in phases, using its own corpus to implement the initial phases, and securitizes the results from these phases to raise future funds. We examine the challenges of using a results based funding model for an NGO."
