2007"In this paper we expand upon a previous INFORMS paper which presented an analysis of proposed categorization models developed for spreadsheet use in organizations. We have now completed a further phase of research whose purpose was to refine the model and define specific model dimensions. We report on this further phase and outline a plan to fully validate the model."
