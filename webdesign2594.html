2013"The power grid is dependent on information and communication technologies for the integration of data collected by intelligent measurement devices such as phasor measurement units (PMU).  Recent studies have shown that the power grid has significant cyber vulnerabilities which could increase when PMUs are used extensively. In this research, a risk mitigation model is proposed to respond to cyber-attacks to PMU networks. We model the optimal response action as a mixed integer linear programming."
