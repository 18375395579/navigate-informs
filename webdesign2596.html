2012"Variable message signs should be located to improve system-wide traffic conditions, yet their impact cannot be easily predicted due to drivers reacting in a user-optimal, rather than system-optimal, manner. This research uses a genetic algorithm to find effective solutions, using the cell transmission model to propagate traffic flow and a dynamic, bounded-rational equilibrium concept."
