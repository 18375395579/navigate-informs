2012"We propose a model that integrates certain aspects of the schedule design, fleet assignment, and aircraft routing processes, while considering various modeling features. Maintenance routing decisions as well as through-flight opportunities are additionally incorporated in our model, and we apply a series of different solution techniques to handle the large-scale model formulation, reduce its complexity, and enhance its solvability."
