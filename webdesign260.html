2008"Web browsers constantly make choices about which web site to view and whether to continue browsing at the current web site or switch to an alternative one. In this research we propose a choice model to predict user browsing behavior which implicitly defines competition. We find that users tend to view related topics together and propose a text mining approach to categorize textual information on a page. We combine this with a time series model to capture user switching behavior across websites."
