2012"Defend-Attack-Defend (DAD) Models are widely used in power grid contingencies and security studies. In this study, we consider line  switching,  one of the most effective operations to mitigate deliberate outages or attacks, in DAD model. We evaluate the benefits of transmission line switching by comparing the case without line switching."
