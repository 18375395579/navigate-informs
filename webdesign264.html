2013"We present a simulation model for large two-time scale networks that increases the efficiency compared to a discrete event simulation model. Faster point processes are replaced by a "fluid" (ghost process) to accelerate the execution time. When a local clock advances due to a slower event, retrospective calculations (Filtered Monte Carlo) recover the fine detail lost in the fluid model. Efficiency improvement results not only from the speed of execution, but also from variance reduction."
