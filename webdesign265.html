2008"Our goal is to adaptively adjust the fidelity of a simulation model against available computational resources.  Four algorithms are embedded into a simulation model to perform data filtering, fidelity selection, fidelity assignment, and task generation.  Grid computing and Web Services are used for computational resources management and inter-operable communications among distributed software components.  The proposed approach is applied for control of distributed manufacturing enterprises."
