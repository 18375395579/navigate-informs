2012"I survey research on planning and management for Emergency Medical Services, including: Forecasting demand, forecasting response times, measuring performance, choosing base locations, allocating ambulances to bases, based on predictable and unpredictable changes in demand and travel times.  I focus on empirical work, the use of analytical stochastic models, and ways in which medical researchers and operations researchers could benefit from collaboration."
