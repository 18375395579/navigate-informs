2013"The GPS-abled personal digital devices, such as smart phones and tablet, can be used for automatic travel survey data collection. However, in metropolitan areas, travelers?daily trips usually use a variety of modes. Some of the modes are hard to distinguish. A hybrid method integrating the neural network and trajectory critical points is proposed to extract trip information from travelers?trajectory data. The neural network is used for first level classification; the trajectory critical points, defined as the data points representing transfers between different travel states, are extracted and used for the second level classification. The proposed method was by real personal trajectory data. The results indicate that the proposed method did well in both accuracy and consistency."
