2008"We use exact simulation to price CDO tranches under a new dynamic model, the conditional survival (CS) model, which provides excellent calibration to both iTraxx tranches and underlying single name CDS Spreads on March 14, 2008, the day before the collapse of Bear Stern, when the market was highly volatile. The simulation algorithm is fast and easy to implement due to the structure of the CS model. We also discuss variance reduction and sensitivity analysis for the simulation."
