2007"Can SD be used to model an ED?  EDs have previously been modeled via DES, with little history of the use of SD.  A high-level simulation of an ED at The Ottawa Hospital was developed to test various scenarios requested by TOH.  The goal of the model is to provide hospital administrators with a tool to assist them with making long-term resource allocation decisions in an effort to reduce delays in the ED.  Scenario outcomes, as well as the pros and cons of SD in such a model are discussed."
