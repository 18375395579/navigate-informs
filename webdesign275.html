2012"We introduce a new type of initialization problem that arises in real-time simulations. In such applications, the state needed to initialize the simulation is not completely observable, either because monitoring the physical system does not provide complete information or because the model includes artificial states that are not observable. We discuss the new initialization issues, make connections to the filtering literature, and present two algorithms to address these issues."
