2012"The cardiac action potential is produced by the orchestrated functions of ion channel dynamics. This investigation is aimed at modeling the variations of cardiac electrical signaling due to remodeling of a K+ channels. This multi-scale modeling investigation reveals novel mechanisms of hERG channel modulation by regulated glycosylation that also impact cardiac myocyte and tissue functions. It can potentially lead to new pharmaceutical treatments and drug designs for cardiac arrhythmia."
