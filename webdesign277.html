2006"This presentation examines the limitations of networked systems to screen persons when presenting themselves at a controlled checkpoint.  We present a framework for evaluating the risk in networked screening systems using as examples the Transportation Security Administration’s Secure Flight system and the Department of Homeland Security’s US-VISIT program.  We show that all components of the systems can function as described, but that as a whole each system can fail to satisfy its goals."
