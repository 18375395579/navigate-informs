2012"Network models are being increasingly used to model and evaluate systematic risk in financial systems.  However, it is known that systematic risk takes multiple forms and is dynamic in nature. To address this issue, we describe an evolving network model for financial systems and use network wide metrics(NWM) to evaluate the systematic risk.  We provide a precise mathematical description of the asymptotic behavior of the NWM and their interpretations for the risk problem."
