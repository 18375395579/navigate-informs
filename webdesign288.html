2006"A software package, DynoPC, uses IPOPT as the NLP solver to solve discretized dynamic optimization problems simultaneously. It invokes ADOL-C to evaluate constraints, Jacobians and Hessians required by IPOPT, based on user-supplied models. The package has been updated according to new developments of IPOPT, and tested on challenging examples."
