2006"A golf handicap can be viewed as a moving average of moving order statistics. A brief review of existing results based on the naïve assumption of i.i.d. normality of the generating sequence (i.e. your golf scores) will be given, along with a discussion of our simulations using a large multi-year data base of handicapped scores from an industrial Golf Tournament League."
