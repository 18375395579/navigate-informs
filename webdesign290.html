2013"We design robust/semi-robust networks for stochastic demand and topological parameters subject to independent uncertainty sets. Depending on how much data available, we minimize the maximum/expected losses by using robust/stochastic optimization models. The semi-robust approach employs SAA while bounding the maximum loss. Different cutting planes are developed to improve the computational efficacy."
