2008"Survival analysis involves predicting the time to event for patients in a dataset, based on a set of recorded attributes. We propose a new methodology, Logical Analysis of Survival Data (LASD), to identify interactions between variables (survival patterns) without any prior hypotheses. Using these set of patterns, we predict survival distributions for each observation. To evaluate LASD we select two publicly available  datasets: a lung adenocarcinoma dataset (gene-expression profiles) and the other a breast cancer dataset (clinical profiles)."
