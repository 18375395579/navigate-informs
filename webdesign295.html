2007"Options technology when applied within a corporation for strategic decision-making is called real options. These leading-edge risk and valuation mathematical methods more accurately determine effective investment strategies to reduce risk and shape project value outcome. A new airplane business case is used to illustrate various valuation techniques with modeling and simulation enhancements. Business engineering extends real options into systems engineering for comprehensive project management."
