2013"Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) are used to track the use of biofuels in the US transportation infrastructure and are the primary currency to demonstrate compliance with the mandated biofuel volume requirements. The RIN market and its respective players will be modeled using an equilibrium problem, which will be used to quantify the effects of parallel incentives in the form of tax credits and other policy initiatives."
