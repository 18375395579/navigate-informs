2012"The objective of this paper is developing a mathematical model that optimizes vehicle relocation operations given a trip pattern for a particular set of stations. A simulation model is also developed to apply different relocation policies for the same instances. We conclude that it is not possible to reach the optimum results using relocation policies. However both approaches lead to a significant increase in the profit of the company."
