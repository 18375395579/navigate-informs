2006"In an effort to cope with air traffic demand growths and changing demand patterns, government and industry have developed simulation tools to model future concepts of air traffic management. We present a model for system-wide traffic flow management, which can be attached to existing simulation tools as a module. The model is multi-objective, considering efficiency, equity, and flexibility. Integer programs and network flow formulations are used to capture efficiency in the model."
