2012"In applying Markowitz’s portfolio selection model to the Korean stock market, we developed an investment framework that combines overall input parameters, such as minimum expected return required, rebalancing period, and key inputs for portfolio theory. Instead of using the conventional SMA, we used EWMA to estimate the key inputs. Our comprehensive framework showed the efficacy of the Markowitz's model by outperforming all four of our benchmarks, during the 2007-2011 global financial crisis."
