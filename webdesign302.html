2006"The semiconductor industry uses CMP to realize smooth (Ra ~1nm) and flat surfaces for VLSI device fabrication. Complex dynamics underlying the CMP process is a major impediment to effective quality monitoring. It is shown that the signal features, extracted from a novel wireless vibration sensor array, that capture the underlying nonlinear stochastic dynamics provide > 10% improvement in the tracking of CMP material removal rates compared to the use of conventional features."
