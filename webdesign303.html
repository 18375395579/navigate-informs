" 1 - Multiscale Methodology and Detectability"
Xiaoming Huo, Assistant Professor, xiaoming@isye.gatech.edu"
2006"Multiscale methodology leads to powerful processing tools, such as wavelets. It has been proven to be effective in determining boundaries in some detectability problems, which is a fundamental problem in detection and ubiquitous in engineering. The existing results give the asymptotic rate of the boundaries. More precise distributional results can be derived, and they reveal more accurate properties of statistics that are used. Some recent results and applications will be discussed."
