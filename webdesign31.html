2008"In this paper we examine the impact of environmental legislation and Design-for-Environment on the behavior of a closed-loop supply chain with recycling activities. We develop a dynamic model using System Dynamics methodology applied to many environmental systems. The developed model is implemented to a real world supply chain of electrical equipment in Greece. Sensitivity analysis reveals statistically significant factors that affect sustainability from an environmental and financial approach."
