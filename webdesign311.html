2012"We define non-negative bias caused by greedy sampling in exploitation steps of reinforcement learning using value estimation. We propose additive bias correction framework and apply it to Q learning to construct bias-corrected Q learning. Significant bias reduction and accelerated policy learning are demonstrated in Roulette simulation and intelligent battery control in power grid simulation."
