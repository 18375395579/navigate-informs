2013"Multi-step clustering prediction is investigated using Dirichlet process based symbolic dynamic analysis. Symbolic sequence is constructed based on Dirichlet process clustering. Our case studies show that this approach outperforms conventional models for multi-step clustering prediction for non-stationary systems."
