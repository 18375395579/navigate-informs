2006"A methodology for constructing cost-effective live-fire test and evaluation (LFT&E) programs within the MMF environment is presented.  Issues addressed include the design and execution of LFT&E programs to ensure the collection of data relevant to the assessment of system vulnerability/lethality and the evaluation of test results in a format useful to decision-makers concerned with accomplishing system of systems collective tasks and achieving mission success in the joint environment."
