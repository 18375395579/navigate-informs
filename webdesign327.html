" 1 - Estimating Congestion Impacts on Rail Lines via Statistical Methods"

2007"As railroads become more and more congested with increasing traffic base, it becomes paramount to estimate the congestion impact of new traffic.  Well-tested, specialized simulation software is often used for such predictions. However, simulations have some drawbacks and are time consuming to run.  We test the viability of statistical methods as a low cost alternative for prediction the impact of additional trains on train running times.  Empirical results are presented."
