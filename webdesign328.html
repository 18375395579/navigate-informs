Zhiguang Qian, Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin at Madison, zhiguang@stat.wisc.edu"
2007"In this talk, we will discuss two novel classes of space-filling designs for computer modeling. One is motivated by the problem of synthesis of simulations at different levels of accuary and the other is motivated by modeling computer experiments with qualitative and quantitative factors."
