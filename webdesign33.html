2013"Commodity contingent revolvers (CCRs) are credit vehicles used by firms to manage the margin risk that results from losses in their hedging portfolios.  Assets with real optionality, require dynamic hedging strategies.  The pricing of real options CCRs require  a priori knowledge of the optimal exercise and hedging strategy.  This paper presents the first method for pricing CCRs based on dynamic hedging strategies with multi-factor, multi-commodity futures price models."
