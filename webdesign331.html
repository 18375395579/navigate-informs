2007"In this talk, we present an efficient method for pricing discretely monitored lookback option in Levy process models. The method involves a sequential evaluation of Hilbert transforms. A discrete approximation with exponentially decaying errors is developed based on the Whittaker cardinal series for functions analytic in a strip in the complex plane."
