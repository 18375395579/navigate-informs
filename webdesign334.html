2006"Robust Parameter Design has been studied and applied, in most cases, assuming a linear model under standard assumptions.  More recently, RPD has been considered in a generalized linear model (GLM) setting.  In this paper we apply a general dual response approach when using RPD in the case of a GLM.  We motivate the need for exploring both the process mean and process variance, by discussing situations when a compromise between the two is necessary."
