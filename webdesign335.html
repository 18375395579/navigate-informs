2006"We propose a hybrid Bertrand-Cournot model of electricity markets where inter-subnetwork connections are frequently congested but intra-subnetwork connections are not. In this model, generators behave Cournot regarding inter-subnetwork transmission quantities, but Bertrand regarding intra-subnetwork transmission prices. Numerical examples suggest that this model leads to equilibrium prices higher than those from a homogeneous Bertrand model, but lower than those from a homogenous Cournot model."
