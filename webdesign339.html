2006"This paper presents a robust estimation procedure for determining between-node distances in a wireless sensor network, known as the calibration problem in sensor localization.  The problem is modeled by a structured linear regression. We suggest using a robust regression estimator but need to revise it to account for the structural information.  We will demonstrate that the sensor cluster pattern in a network determines the structure and will thus affect the system robustness for calibration."
