2007"Large scale, detailed MIP models support long range planning in Chilean copper mines. To compact these models for use in corporate strategic decisions or to incorporate stochastic elements, we use cluster  analysis. One method, a priori, aggregates the mine blocks before defining the MIP; the second, a posteriori, aggregates columns of the  LP.  Results with data from a large underground copper mine show reductions in CPU times and error bounds."
