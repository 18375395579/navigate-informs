2012"We study the problem of estimating parameters for Levy-Driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic volatility models, which has a wide range of applications in finance, econometrics, and statistics.  We consider the problem in the framework of maximum likelihood estimation and use various techniques in simulation optimization, including conditional Monte Carlo sensitivity estimation and sequential Monte Carlo method for hidden Markov processes.  We present numerical results to validate out method."
