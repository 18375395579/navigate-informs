2008"A key element in developing accurate computational tools for RNA secondary structure prediction is the development of accurate scoring functions for distinguishing correct secondary structures from incorrect suboptimal structures.  Traditionally, parameter estimation in RNA thermodynamic models have relied primarily on optical melting experiments, though in recent years, statistical approaches to parameter learning for RNA folders have gained in popularity.  In this talk, we describe techniques for estimation of folding parameters for RNA secondary structured prediction from known RNA secondary structures using methods from convex optimization.  In particular, we describe simple dual coordinate ascent algorithms for learning RNA folding models efficiently on single-processor machines."
