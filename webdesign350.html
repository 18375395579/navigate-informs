2013"We propose two bi-level models based on principal-agent theory in order to analyze possible economic effects of implementing different inventive mechanisms to foster energy efficiency in power distribution companies. The difference between both models is that in one, the energy savings are subject to uncertainty through the CVaR concept. In general terms, it is convenient for the government to adopt a performance-based incentive mechanism than a payment scheme financing the fixed costs."
