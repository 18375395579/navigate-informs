2013"We measure service quality based on service process, and examine relationships among product/service quality, and product/service loyalty. We develop a construct to evaluate process based service quality. We collect data from customers of auto maintenance centers to measure perceived quality and loyalty. We test relationships between constructs using a structural equation model and regression analysis."
