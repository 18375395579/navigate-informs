2006"Dynamic network models are important for genetics, social science, disease tracking, and counterterrorism. The traditional school in this area has emphasized formal mathematical models, but many researchers find agent-based models to be more useful. The main problem for both approaches is goodness-of-fit testing. This talk discusses the goodness-of-fit issue and describes solution strategies."
