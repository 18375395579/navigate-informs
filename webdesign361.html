2007"The need for better disaster planning models has grown significantly, especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Several Federal authorities state that there are weaknesses in the models currently used in practice. We present a robust optimization model for identifying relief shelter locations and the levels of emergency supplies to position at the shelters prior to a hurricane threat to a targeted area. We apply the model to three different evacuation scenarios and show its promise."
