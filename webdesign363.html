2008"MALTA is a temporally and spatially scalable dynamic vehicular traffic  simulation and assignment model that is based on network partitioning  concepts and techniques for both mesoscopic traffic simulation and  time-dependent shortest path algorithms. In this talk we present the overall model structure and the numerical experiment results on a test urban traffic network."
