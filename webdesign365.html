2012"We introduce a new statistical learning method, integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Markov Random Field (MRF) approaches, to segment different transgenic mouse brain models Magnetic Resonance Microscopy (MRM) images. By using our model, more accurate, computational efficient and robust result can be achieved."
