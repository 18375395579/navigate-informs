2012"Multivariate process control in Distributed Sensor Networks (DSN) is a challenging issue. This research study proposes a method to adaptively reallocate sensor resources based on online observations in a Bayesian network, which can enhance monitoring and diagnosis capabilities. Case studies are performed on a hot forming process and a cap alignment process to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under different objectives."
