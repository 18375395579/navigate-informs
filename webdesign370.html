2008"We show how approximate dynamic programming can be used to combine the power of math programming with the flexibility of simulation to provide practical solutions to complex problems.  This tutorial will introduce ADP using a variety of applications, and describe the different algorithmic strategies available when approximating the impact of a decision now on the future.  These ideas will be illustrated using industrial applications in transportation, energy and finance."
