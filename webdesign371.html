2013"Prognosis of remaining useful life (RUL) of a unit or a system plays an important role in system reliability. One key aspect of the RUL prognosis is constructing the best prediction interval. In this paper, we propose a new method, namely maximum prediction power interval (MPI). The MPI guarantees the best prediction performance under the given acceptable error range. A numerical simulation study and case study with real data confirm the better features of MPI over existing prediction intervals."
