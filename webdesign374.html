2012"Many sub-Saharan countries experience high mortality rates among HIV+ infants. An important cause is the long delay to obtain diagnosis due to ineffective systems for transporting and analyzing blood samples and communicating results. Using a representative dataset combining information from several countries, we develop a queueing network model to estimate the potential public health impact of operational interventions such as clinic assignment optimization and segmentation of samples."
