2013"ATM frauds have increased across the globe and in size; these massive frauds involve stolen cards with software tampering of ATM networks to increase the daily limit, followed by withdrawal of currency using cashing crews.     By adding behavior based second layer of authentication we can easily detect and prevent massive simultaneous ATM frauds. Leveraging Big Data, we propose innovative non-interfering, intuitive, adaptive Behavioral security that will prevent massive ATM fraud."
