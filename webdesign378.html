2012"We present a dynamic simulation approach with forward-looking assessment of market states. This new approach allows to control and select different simulation regimes and forecasting horizons as well as models based on the attributes of risk factors and portfolios. This approach can better forecast market states and capture extreme events so to improve various risk measures for VAR, stress testing and liquidity risk management, and assessment of economic capital across the entire enterprise."
