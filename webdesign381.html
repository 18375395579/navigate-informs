2012"In this work, we propose a new distribution-free Phase I control chart for monitoring location parameter whose construction is based on empirical likelihood ratio test. The performance of the proposed chart, in terms of the signal probability, is compared with that of the Mann-Whitney, Cramer-von-Mises and Kolmogorov-Smirnov based distribution-free Phase I charts for individual observations. A non-manufacturing example is included in which the competing charts are applied and compared."
