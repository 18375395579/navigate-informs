2006"Development of a less-sensitive HIV test that detects recent infection has enabled the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop new estimators for annual HIV incidence in the United States based on HIV reporting data.  We develop statistical models noting that: individuals choose how frequently to get tested; test frequency varies among individuals; only HIV+ test results are reported; and prior HIV-negative testing dates can be obtained from supplementary data sources."
