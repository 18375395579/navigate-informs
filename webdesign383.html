2007"We propose a parametric version of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) via Copulas - families of multivariate distributions that join univariate margins to multivariate distributions. Our procedure exploits the role for copula models in information theory  and offers a unified view of component analysis procedures, in particular, by parameterizing multivariate dependence."
