2013"In rail-based Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS), such as those used to transport wafers in semi-conductor manufacturing, vehicular congestion results in reduced production efficiency.  We present vehicle routing strategies to prevent congestion including dynamic routing, where routes are adjusted based on current congestion, and intentional route distribution using a multi-commodity flow model. We provide results from a simulated prototype facility."
