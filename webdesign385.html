2013"We use dynamic programming to model the effect of power outages on operations and state of charge of storage in subsequent periods. We then estimate the state of charge probability distribution and use it as a forced outage rate of the storage device in standard reliability-based capacity value estimation techniques. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodology over existing approximation techniques using numerical case studies."
