2007"Conventional valuation techniques show limitations when applied to strategic investments, which require substantial capital commitment under conditions of significant uncertainty. In the face of deep uncertainty, analytical methods make several assumptions to simplify the problem. Rather than hide from this situation, agent-based approach exploits uncertainty and provides a level set of policy recommendations for deeply uncertain system using simulation, optimization and real-options framework."
