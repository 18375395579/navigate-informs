2008"Currently, patients?diagnostics are usually based on a single data point from the most recent test, ignoring the patient's historical record. No other methods are currently utilized to assist physicians in capturing the dynamic nature of physiologic systems and hidden interactions between test indicators. Timely identification of possible adverse outcomes in patients' health can be improved, by developing integrated patients' profiles and the analysis of laboratory tests over time."
