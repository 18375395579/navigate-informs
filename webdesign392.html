2007"Anti-money laundering is an important responsibility. There are millions of transactions happening each day. Investigating each transaction and classifying an account to be suspicious or not is time-consuming. In this article, we propose an active learning method using Bayesian sequential designs to detect money-laundering. The sequential nature helps to identify suspicious accounts with minimal effort. An application to real banking data is used to demonstrate the performance of the method."
