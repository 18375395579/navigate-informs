2012"Decision Makers (DMs) usually focus their cognitive effort on the evaluation of alternatives. Keeney (1992) postulates that DMs should start with their values and objectives to create systematically better alternatives. Robust Ordinal Regression uses holistic pairwise comparisons as an effective method to elicitate the DMs preferences. The choice of an internship exemplifies how students can use their cognitive abilities effectively by creating better alternatives and evaluating them easily."
