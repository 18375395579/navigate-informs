2007"We investigate how to use exact simulation technique to estimate prices and Greeks of derivative securities. The idea is to consider the probability density of diffusions under Wiener measure, instead of Lebesgue measure. The availability of closed form under Wiener measure facilitates us conducting simulation to draw "exact" samples and meanwhile obtaining unbiased estimators with small variances for Greeks."
