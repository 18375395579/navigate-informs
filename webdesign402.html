2007"We propose a new risk management based framework to model an exercise strategy for Employee Stock Options. The framework leads to an intuitive barrier based exercise policy under which the cost of issuing an Employee Stock Option can be bracketed by narrowly separated bounds. Moreover, the approach can also be applied to price a portfolio of options."
