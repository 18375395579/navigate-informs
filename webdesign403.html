2012"We present a novel approach, which combines nondecimated wavelet transform with the   boosting trees method, to model energy prices for detecting and predicting price spikes.  Intuitive   and mathematical description of the methodology is provided. The case studies on Australia  electricity markets (both Queenland and New South Wales) show  enhanced prediction accuracy and lowered false alarm rate  than those of existing methods in the literature."
