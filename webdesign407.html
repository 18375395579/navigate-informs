2012"In this paper we present a bidding technique that can be used by a Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) company in order to submit optimal quotes in a combinatorial auction. The objective is to minimize the miles traveled by trucks. This problem is solved using a Branch-and-Price technique. Numerical results show the implications of using LTL strategies over the usual Truck-Load (TL) strategies presented in previous literature."
