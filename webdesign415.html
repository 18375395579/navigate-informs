2012"We perform multi-stage stochastic optimization of a simplified energy system. The system consists of roughly 30 technologies used to supply primary energy resources, refine petroleum, generate electricity, and serve end use demands. The model incorporates crude oil, natural gas, and coal prices as stochastic parameters. Results indicate that the energy system requires little recourse as uncertainty is revealed over a multi-decadal time horizon."
