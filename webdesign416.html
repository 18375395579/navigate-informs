2007"A model is developed for the inhalation anthrax incubation period distribution which is in good agreement with human data from the 1979 accidental atmospheric anthrax release in Sverdlovsk, Russia and limited non-human primate data. This model is used to determine the time at which clinical diagnosis might first detect an anthrax outbreak based on early symptomatic cases, the efficacy of medical intervention and the recommended duration for antibiotic treatment."
