2013"The practical use of Markov decision processes (MDPs) can be affected by their sensitivity to unknown distributional model parameters that have to be estimated by the decision maker. To counter the detrimental effects of estimation errors, we consider robust MDPs that offer probabilistic guarantees in view of the unknown parameters. To this end, we construct a confidence region for the parameters, and we determine policies that attain the best worst-case performance over this confidence region."
