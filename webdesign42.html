2013"Till June 27, 2013, WHO reported 131 confirmed cases (with 30% fatality) of influenza in China from bird-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus. Hence, the concern is high that H7N9 may become human-to-human transmittable. We use data from recent reports and a simulation model to predict impact of a potential H7N9 pandemic outbreak in the U.S."
