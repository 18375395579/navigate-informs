2006"This presentation brings a methodological discussion on facing elicitation difficulties regarding preference-related parameters. Robustness analysis is contrasted with sensitivity analysis, and its role is discussed. A compromise is proposed regarding the ideas of heroic approximation, requisite modeling, and rigorous modeling. The proposed methodology consists of using robustness analysis throughout the whole decision process as a tool to guide that process, using DSS such as VIP or IRIS."
