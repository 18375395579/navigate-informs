2008"The liver transplantation system in the United States publishes incomplete information about the composition of the liver transplant waiting list. We model and analyze the accept/reject decision of a liver patient under this incomplete information system as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). We compare the POMDP model to a previous MDP model to obtain more precise estimates of the patient’s price of privacy. We present the results of clinically driven numerical experiments."
