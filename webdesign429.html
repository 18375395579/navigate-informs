2012"Counterparty credit risk measurement requires extensive use of Monte Carlo simulation. We analyze and comment on recent Monte Carlo counterparty credit risk methodologies being employed by financial institutions. We, also, develop an efficient Monte Carlo framework for estimation of average-type counterparty credit risk measures."
