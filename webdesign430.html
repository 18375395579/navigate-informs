2013"We propose a new modeling approach to address the challenges that arise in power systems with a high penetration of renewable energy sources by introducing system states instead of traditional load periods. This allows us to represent important operational details such as start-up and shut- down decisions in medium- or long-term models thereby overcoming the lack of chronological information predominant in current models."
