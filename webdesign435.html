2012"Once a BRT system is in operation, it is often necessary to adjust the routes to improve the system’s performance. Congestion is perhaps the single most important decision criterion to (re)design the BRT routes. Thus, we present a network-oriented formulation and a heuristic approach based on congestion estimates useful to (re)design the BRT routes."
