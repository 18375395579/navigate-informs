2007"The goal in surface mining is to extract material from an open pit so as to maximize NPV of the usable ore in the pit.  Doing this is limited by constraints that:  prevent the hole from filling in on itself, limit production and processing capabilities, and ensure the mine is profitable.  We describe the complexities involved in efficiently sequencing this ore removal process and examine some possible methodologies to expedite the solution time for this difficult mixed integer program."
