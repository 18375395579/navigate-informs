2008"Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is the use of a linear program to model the flow of metabolites through reactions in a cell.  Simulations using FBA models can generate hypotheses testable in a lab environment.  A common problem when studying bacteria is the development of a defined culture medium that will sustain the organism.  We develop a mixed-integer program that aids in the construction of FBA models and indicates possible components of a sustaining culture medium."
