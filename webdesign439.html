2008"We propose a new data collection mechanism (barter markets), as an alternative to conjoint analysis, that allows for information diffusion among respondents, as an accelerated method to capture real life learning and measurement of consumer's partworths for product features.  An empirical study that compares the barter method and choice-based   conjoint demonstrates very superior out-of-sample predictive   performance, both immediately (as is commonly done) and on a two-week   later validation task, based on data collected from a barter market.  We also show evidence that respondents indeed learn from those who are   familiar with the product suggesting those cases, and for what people, the barter market is likely to be superior to traditional conjoint measurement methods. However, in the spirit of "no free lunch", as the barter mechanism is "new to the world", we found that subjects did find the task more taxing (in various ways) suggesting a potential tradeoff between consumer resource allocation (at the time of the   task) and (managerial) predictive accuracy."
