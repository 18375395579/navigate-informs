2006"This paper presents the impact of operational flexibility on aircraft conversion from an older to a newer version at the US Coast Guard (USCG). We consider three levels of flexibility: full flexibility, partial flexibility and no flexibility. Both optimization models and Markov Chain based models have been developed to compare aircraft performance under the above three levels of flexibility."
