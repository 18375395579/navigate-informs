2012"This talk discusses how to use multiple data sources, including loop detector counts, AVI Bluetooth travel time readings and GPS location samples, to estimate mesoscropic traffic states on a homogeneous freeway segment. We extend Newell's three-detector method to approximate  stochastic cumulative flow counts, by using a multinomial probit model and Clark's approximation method."
