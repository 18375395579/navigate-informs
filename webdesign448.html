2008"Bayesian "topic models" often provide surprisingly interpretable descriptions of text/image corpora, yet can fail to capture all subtle/rare topics interesting to users. This can result in irrelevant information retrieval or intelligence not actionable. In this talk, diagnostics for measuring accuracy of topic model involving rare topics are proposed. Supervisions on latent variables are proposed and demonstrated to enhance topic accuracy. Methods are illustrated using a real world application."
