2013"Inter-dependency among the components of an engineering system may affect the lifetimes of components in the system. Most conventional models that investigate the replacement of components are based on the assumption of independence. We propose a policy for determining the replacement thresholds of components while account for the inter-dependency among the components. We demonstrate via numerical studies that our proposed policy reduces the total replacement cost in the long run."
