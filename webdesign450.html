2013"We consider the pricing and revenue implications associated with a new discrete choice model based on ideal utilities. The model’s structure produces a variety of clean analytical results and makes estimation with real data easy. We use the new choice model to estimate optimal revenues and optimal prices for a number of product assortments using data supplied by the company that initiated the project."
