2013"In this survey paper, we focus on G /GI / n+GI parallel-server queues that serve as a building block to model call center operations. We survey recent results on the many-server queues that are operated in the QED and ED regimes. These results include the performance insensitivity to patience time distributions and diffusion and fluid approximate models as practical tools for performance analysis."
