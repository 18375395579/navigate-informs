2013"Objective function weights for multi-criteria optimization for IMRT treatment planning are typically determined in a trial-and-error manner. We develop a regression model to predict the weights for prostate treatment planning using a previously developed inverse optimization method and patient anatomy. Treatment plans generated by the predicted weights were very similar to clinical treatment plans. This approach may support the genesis of personalized weights in IMRT treatment planning."
