2012"After being treated in ED, a patient's waiting time for admission to  inpatient wards depends on time of the day, and can be excessively  long when the patient's bed-request is in the morning. I will promote  stochastic network models that are based on an extensive empirical  study and present a two-time-scale approach to analyze these  models. These analyses allow one to evaluate strategies such as  inpatient discharge timing to flatten out the waiting time statistics  throughout the day."
