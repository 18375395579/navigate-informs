2008"Presumptive write-off of bad debts portfolios while minimizing potential collection losses is a key cost containment strategy for lenders and creditors. Using an example of a healthcare bad debt portfolio we present a two-stage methodology to achieve this. First we develop a predictive model to prioritize delinquent accounts for liquidation and then use stochastic and non-stochastic binary programming to optimize account balance and model scores on a segmented surface."
