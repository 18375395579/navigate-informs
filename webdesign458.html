2006"We discuss the problem of monitoring in the presence of abrupt changes, such as shifts or drifts. We introduce a unified methodology based on use of likelihood ratio tests that enables one to obtain control schemes that provide both good statistical performance and are relatively easy to implement in the sense that they depend on very few design parameters and require a limited computational effort that is dynamically adjusted based on process conditions."
