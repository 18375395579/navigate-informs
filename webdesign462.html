2013"Linking metagenomic profiles host phenotypes and biomolecular details is key to understanding roles of the microbiome in human disease.  I will discuss recent work profiling host-microbe interactions using host gene expression and 16S metagenomic profiling in pouchitis.  This work highlights class prediction and class comparison methodology for metagenomic data, where methods can be adopted from the microarray literature, and where new approaches are needed."
