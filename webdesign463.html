2013"In this talk we shall develop a novel family of bimodal univariate distributions (also allowing for unimodal shapes) and demonstrate its use using the well known and almost classical data set involving durations and waiting times of eruptions of the Old-Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone park. In the process, we develop a bivariate distribution using a copula technique and compare its fit to a mixture of bivariate normal distributions also fitted to the same bivariate data set."
