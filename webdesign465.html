2012"We explore the role gender plays in risk-taking, using data from a large undergraduate decision analysis class in which the midterm uses a probabilistic scoring rule but the final exam does not. Controlling for academic major, we find that women take fewer risks than men, confirming established research on gender and risk-taking. In addition, we find that women perform worse on exams when their grade is determined by the scoring rule instead of conventional grading methods."
