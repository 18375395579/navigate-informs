2012"Location models for emergency medical systems (EMS) have been dominated by coverage models.  So long as an ambulance is within coverage range it is considered covered.  Recent papers have shown the problem with this approach and have tried to incorporate survivability which is a function of how close the ambulance is to the demand location.  In this paper, using simulation optimization to locate ambulances, we are able to show that survivability of EMS patients can be improved."
