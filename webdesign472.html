2012"Autonomous vehicle based storage and retrieval systems present a potential alternative to the traditional technologies used for unit-load warehouse operations. We investigate the performance impact of design decisions such as the configuration of aisles and columns, allocation of resources to zones, and vehicle assignment rules using multi-class semi-open queuing network models. The models are solved using decomposition-based approaches to provide insights useful in design conceptualization."
