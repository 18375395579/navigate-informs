2012"In this paper, we estimate the probability that a football team wins a game based on the point spread and the over/under.  This work is an extension of the Hal Stern's 1991 paper with several key differences: 1) We analyze data for both college and professional football, using a much larger data set. 2) We factor in the over/under as well as the point spread. 3) We explore several non-linear models for the probability function."
