2012"A good IMRT plan is a set of beam angles and intensities that deliver radiation to the tumor while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. Fully evaluating intensities and performance from angle sets is computationally intensive, we data mine evaluated plans to create a model to screen angle sets before evaluation."
