2012"Computational creativity is a multidisciplinary subject that studies how machines can help design artefacts that might be perceived by humans to be creative. We explore the use of search techniques based on two key attributes, quality and novelty, and study Bayesian techniques to measure novelty. We propose a methodology for designing new artefacts starting from a database of extant works, and illustrate the concepts using an example."
