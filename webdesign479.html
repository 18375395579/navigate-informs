2013"We construct and study a continuous time model that incorporates the whole limit order book to inform the joint evolution of the spread and the price processes. The construction of our model is guided by empirical data. In particular, empirical observations suggest a multi-scale asymptotic regime, under which we obtain a  jump-diffusion processes governing the evolution of the spread-price dynamics. The simulation results reproduce stylized features observed empirically."
