2007"We consider a semi-parametric model to describe failure characteristics of a system. Using a gamma process prior for the cumulative intensity function complicates the Bayesian analysis when the updating is based on failure count data. We develop a Bayesian analysis using MCMC methods and determine replacement strategies. Adoption of MCMC methods involves a data augmentation algorithm. We show the use of our approach with actual data."
