2013"We investigate how the change in actual block time distribution will affect SBT and system performance. Firstly this relationship is studied with empirical data and multiple regression models. Using this behavior model, we generate different scenarios with hypothetical changes to actual block time distribution and evaluate the impacts on SBT, delay, and on-time performance. Taking the heterogeneity across airlines into consideration, we also decompose the dataset to study specific airlines."
