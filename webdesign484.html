2007"Realistic and credible agent-based simulations of physical security systems require incorporation of human behavior models for an effective agent model. Operating / patrol strategies of these agents must explicitly include situational awareness, cooperative team behavior, planning and deliberative decision-making processes to improve realism, credibility, and variability. In this talk, we discuss and demonstrate our design for the computational behavior representation for agents."
