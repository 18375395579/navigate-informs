2008"Until recently, much of the math programming community has focused primarily on performance testing and benchmarking, while the general commercial environment has emphasized reliability over performance. We introduce a suite of tools to aid in both QA and performance analysis of solver software. We show how users can effectively use our tools to quality control their solver using a variety of quality metrics. In addition, we show how one can obtain benchmarking and performance information."
