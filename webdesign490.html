2013"Technical efficiency of 259 Jute farmers in Bangladesh is measured using a non-parametric approach (O'Donnell index). Single output and four inputs are used, gathered from CPD field survey. The result shows that the mean efficiency is about 0.54. In the 2nd stage, a Tobit model will be used to identify the factors responsible for technical inefficiency in jute farming in Bangladesh."
