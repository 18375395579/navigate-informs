2013"We present an application of approximate dynamic programming for the control of grid-level energy storage distributed across the electricity grid, under uncertainty in wind power generation and grid congestion. Our case study is based on the PJM grid, which has over 9,000 buses and 14,000 transmission lines. We analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of storage in the presence of grid congestion, as well as the impact of using mixed storage portfolios of different efficiencies and capacities."
