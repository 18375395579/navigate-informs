2012"We propose a dynamic structural model of limited consumer search and validate it on a dataset of 1M online sessions for hotels. It allows us to monetize the search costs under social contexts. Our policy experiment shows that customized rankings can polarize the distribution of search intensity. Our model also indicates a lower price sensitivity than a static model would predict, implying that consumers pay a lot of attention to non-price factors during an online hotel search."
