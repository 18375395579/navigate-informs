2008"Polynomial model forms have been the norm of the researchers working on  Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and regression. These model forms are  often reasonably accurate within a region of interest. Yet, generally RSM  models do not extrapolate accurately outside the experimental design space.  Dimensional analysis involves the selection of a relatively small number of  dimensionless system inputs and model forms chosen to exploit physics-based  knowledge. In this research we propose "Physics-based Response Oriented  Bayesian Empirical Models" (PROBEs) that combines the implied assumptions of  both standard RSM and physics-based modeling. We demonstrate benefits using  real casting and welding process design datasets."
