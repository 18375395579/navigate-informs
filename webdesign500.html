2013"Framework agreements (FAs) are procurement mechanisms commonly used by buying agencies to satisfy demand that arises randomly over a certain time horizon. In this work, we introduce and analyze one of the first FA models in the literature. We provide concrete design recommendations based on our results. These recommendations are being used by the Chilean government to improve their FAs that amount to US$1.9 billion worth of contracts every year."
