2012"Recently, game theory has been shown to be useful for reasoning in security settings about how to optimally allocate limited security resources to best defend a set of critical assets.  In real-world scenarios the adversaries considered are human adversaries who may not behave according to the standard assumptions of game-theoretic models.  We investigate a number of robust approaches and human decision-making models to better address human decision-making in such critical security settings."
