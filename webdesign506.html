2013"Based on the physics-of-failure of stents, we develop a system reliability model that considers the stochastic processes for two dependent failure processes in a multi-stent system in human arteries. System reliability functions are derived for two patient groups with different activity levels. Condition-based maintenance models are developed to minimize the impact of failures of stents. In-vitro fatigue testing data will be presented to analyze the crack growth of this emerging technology."
