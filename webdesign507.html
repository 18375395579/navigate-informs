2007"In this study we propose a robust methodology to estimate Less-than-Truckload (LTL) market rates and a process to benchmark LTL shipments based on historical data. We implemented the process using SAS with MS Access user interface and tested with real world data. Study reveals interesting patterns of the realized market rates."
