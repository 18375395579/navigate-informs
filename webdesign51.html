2007"Dealing with uncertain data in Optimization problems has been an important concern for researchers. Uncertainty in data occurs due to many reasons, one of them being that the data comes from a prediction model. We consider an integer-programming problem with uncertain cost coefficients, where the coefficients come from a prediction model. We propose a robust formulation, which uses simulated values of the cost coefficients, to optimize for the near worst-value of the objective function."
