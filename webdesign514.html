2013"For planning building energy consumption, it is crucial to have a good prediction of solar irradiation. Current practice in predicting solar irradiance on tilt surfaces is to use a model due to Perez (1991) using a simplified geometrical representation of the sky dome. In our work, the potential bias of this model is investigated using statistical methods, and a simple and effective calibration to correct the bias is given as well."
