2013"Assistance offered by salesperson to a customer influences probability and size of purchase. We construct a model of consumer’s in-store behavior that treats sales assistance as an information device to update customer’s beliefs. The provision of sales assistance, however, itself depends on customer characteristics and this creates a source of endogeneity. We propose an empirical framework that addresses this and calibrate it using a unique dataset constructed from in-store video surveillance."
