2006"We evaluate the efficiency of state police services in the US using a multiple-stage data envelopment analysis model.  Technical and scale efficiency are calculated for the 49 continental states. We allow for environmental factors of production and control for these nondiscretionary inputs. Our results indicate that most states are technically efficient, but nearly half are operating at less than optimal scale size."
