2013"We study the joint control problem of dynamic vehicle repositioning and customer admission in a general vehicle sharing system. We present a decentralized approach, based on a closed queueing network model, that is able to be efficiently implemented in an agent-based manner with low-complexity computations. We provide an analysis of our algorithm's long-run performance, along with simulations."
