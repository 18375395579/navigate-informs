2013"In this talk, we propose an efficiency-based currency selection methodology that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA), a non-parametric productivity analysis of relative efficiencies of economic entities, with fundamental analysis in a disciplined manner.  Using this methodology, we construct and analyze several representative structural exchange rate models, including flexible-price monetary model, sticky-price monetary model, trade-weighted dollar model and their extensions."
