2007"Distributed systems  tend to exhibit context-dependent behavior. We model such systems using context trees. For practical applications with a large set of variables that need to be monitored for fault isolation, the set of symbols that are needed to represent the tree is extremely large. This presentation describes an information-theoretic based method to cluster these symbols and reduce the set to a manageable size."
