2012"Dependency lies at the heart of many critical decisions, yet the current decision making practices lack the efficient tools of sensitivity analysis to dependencies among uncertainties due to assessing, modeling and computational challenges. In this paper, we present a general framework for identifying and analyzing the impact of the critical dependencies through the use of sensitivity analysis procedure based on copulas."
