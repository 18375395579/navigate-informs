2013"We investigate the problem of allocating a fixed screening capacity amongst a set of patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. The decision maker faces the challenge of incorporating the knowledge of each patient’s risk, which is learned over time. The performance of potential strategies from the field of reinforcement learning are compared via simulation. Our models are parameterized and validated using clinical data on 1025 patients followed for over 5 years from the HALT-C trial."
