2007"We present measures of information about the parameters provided by observation from the residual life distribution where the support is truncated at the current age. The current age induces a dynamic into the information measures. Dynamic versions of well-known measures of information provided by the data about parameters are studied. These measures are applied to dynamic updating of information about parameters and predictive distributions for some well-known lifetime models."
