2007"In this work, we describe some mathematical models and heuristics methods for dynamic network optimization based solution framework that effectively integrates the evacuation routing and scheduling and logistics support planning.  This tool is expected to provide an intelligent systematic methodology that can be used by transportation planners and emergency management agencies to improve traffic management during hurricane evacuation."
