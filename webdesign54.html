2006"Tamoxifen  and several types of Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) have been used for the prevention and adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.  However, there is currently conflicting evidence and several unanswered questions regarding which inhibitor is most effective for use in post menopausal patients. In this study, our aim is to design effective 5-year drug treatment plans considering Tamoxifen and AIs for postmenopausal women with breast cancer using integer programming techniques."
