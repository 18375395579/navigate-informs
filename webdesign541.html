2006"This paper demonstrates the impact of different planning models within a large industrial gas company for its production and distribution during the course of a month. We build an optimization model approximating the model in place at the company and a simulation mechanism that allows us to create instances of varying time-granularities. Computational results are given to reveal the best course of action that minimizes the frequency and severity of intra-month schedule adjustments."
