2008"Given the swift increase in aircraft load factors in the United States over the past several years, carriers are increasingly faced with fewer options for accommodating passenger demand during irregular operations.  In this work, we seek to examine the use of decreased flight cancellations as a mechanism for coping with increased load factors.  To this end, we use regression models to examine both nationwide and market-specific data to estimate the strength of this trend."
