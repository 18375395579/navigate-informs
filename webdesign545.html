2013"Clustering large data sets is important for many data mining applications. Conventional clustering approaches (k-means, hierarchical clustering, etc.) typically do not scale well for very large data sets. We will investigate the use of data stream clustering algorithms as light-weight alternatives to conventional algorithms on large non-streaming data using several synthetic and real-world data sets."
