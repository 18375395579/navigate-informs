2006"This paper examines the antecedents and consequences of Internet use in the procurement process. Drawing upon the resource-based view of the firm and the technology, organization and environment framework, we develop an integrative model that examines the antecedents and consequences of Internet use in two stages of the procurement process. The model enables us to deconstruct both the usage and the performance aspects of IT use and to provide insights into the enablers of use and business value."
