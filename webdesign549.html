2008"MCDB is a database system that allows a user to attach distributions to database records, to represent uncertainty that is present within the records. To answer queries, MCDB generates many database instances using those distributions, and runs the underlying query over each of them to measure the effect of the uncertainty on the query result. MCDB's Monte Carlo approach allows specification of arbitrary distributions and estimation of arbitrary functionals of the query-result distribution."
