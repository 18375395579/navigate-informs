2008"We develop a modeling framework for financing and leasing big-ticket heavy equipment such as aircraft, ships, rail stock, etc. taking into account the risk of default as well as the collateral asset price risk. As an application, we present a model for the valuation of export credit guarantees in the aircraft sector."
