2013"We investigate a medical clinic that offers a range of face-to-face services for overweight children by providers such as medical doctors, nutritionist and psychologist. The multi-resource nature of the clinic experiences asymmetric no-show rates amongst providers. Through the development and analysis of a long period simulation model, we investigate various appointment scheduling schemes in order to improve both the clinic’s efficiency and patient satisfaction."
