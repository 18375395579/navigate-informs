2006"Some railway operators have, over the last decade, adopted Revenue Optimization (RO strategies borrowed from the airline industry. There are, however, many structural factors that render classical RO approaches less appropriate in a railway context. We present a new framework based on choice modeling and bilevel programming that can tackle the RO problems faced by this industry. We show that this approach address many of the new challenges for the carriers."
