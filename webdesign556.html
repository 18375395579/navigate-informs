2013"In this research we develop control charts to monitor multi-stream binary data and to do that we develop two kinds of control charts. The first control chart is a log-likelihood ratio based Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) chart for monitoring all the data streams simultaneously. Thus letting us have a system level monitoring scheme. The second kind of control chart is for monitoring individual binary stream.  These chart are shown to have better ability to detect changes than traditional Shewhart chart."
