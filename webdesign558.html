2008"Radar netting techniques developed and evaluated using Radar Target Object Map (RTOM) applied with the Tactical Component Network are described. The RTOM is presented with an illustration of the approach. Applications of RTOM are described and illustrated using track data fusion of X-Band Radars. It is shown that the use of RTOM provides a key ingredient to allow sensors to work as a unit in a coordinated manner with direct communications between them and with the fire units under C2BMC control."
