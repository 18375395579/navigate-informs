2013"Understanding where cyclists prefer to travel is a critical part of developing bicycle networks.  This study uses trip diary records from the 2008 Chicago Travel Tracker Survey to calculate a scalable gravity model function to forecast cyclists?movements over a variety of trip purposes.  The model includes a series of accessibility-characteristics, such as zone development and activity opportunities, elevation changes, traffic patterns, distances, and the existence of bicycle facilities."
