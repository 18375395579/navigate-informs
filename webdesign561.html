2007"We present deformable models that integrate shape and appearance for reliably locating object boundaries in medical images.  The models are energy- minimizing, smooth splines that are pulled toward boundary features by external image forces. The image forces are derived in a variational framework that consists of edge-based and region-based energy terms, both differentiable w.r.t. deformation parameters. We show the effectiveness of the models using organ and tumor segmentation examples."
