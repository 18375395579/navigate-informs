2006"A theoretical model of group behavior is introduced in this paper. We assume that each agent possesses a system of self-reflexion: a set of images of the self which can have sets of images of the self, etc. The model allows us to predict the agent’s state based on his system of self-reflexion and reflexive control over him conducted by other agents."
