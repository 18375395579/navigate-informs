2007"We present a Petri Net-based approach automating the MIP formulation of the Supply Chain configuration problem with alternative assembly sequences.  We start with a Petri Net model of the assembly processes, which unfolds into the Supply Chain model.  The MIP formulation is based on the matrix representation of this model."
