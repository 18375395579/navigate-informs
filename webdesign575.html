2008"We develop concepts related to modeling the acquisition and use of information in a simple matrix game. We apply this model to a battlefield game to measure effective game values. The results show that there is value in the information gained by partitioning the matrix game based on information sets and more finely partitioned information sets provide more valuable information.
