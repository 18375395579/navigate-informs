2012"We confirm the existence of workload-related safety tipping points for in-hospital mortality using discharge records of 83,485 patients in 234 clinical departments. We use a survival model with discharge selection and estimate that 12% of all deaths of patients who experience workload above the tipping point can be explained by workload."
