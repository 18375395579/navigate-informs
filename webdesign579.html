2013"Our research objective is to discover factors that correlate with winning Information Technology (IT) outsourcing contracts in a competitive setting.  By understanding these correlations, an IT service provider can potentially increase the chances of winning a bid by improving the quality of critical situation-dependant factors.  Using data from a large IT service provider, we conduct a correlation analysis to select model features, and build a predictive model using the naïve Bayesian approach."
