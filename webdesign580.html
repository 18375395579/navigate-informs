2008"We summarize the usefulness of several risk assessment/management techniques currently in use to assess threats, vulnerabilities and consequences for homeland security decision making. Using bioterrorism as an illustrative example, we explore commercially available software to compare several techniques. We specifically focus on the feasibility of using this software to perform risk assessment/management. We explore different scale models to assess the benefits of additional fidelity."
