2008"We present an integer programming model to route & schedule trains through a network, based on expected travel times, to minimize delays. Aggregation techniques are employed to maintain the tractability of the model while routing trains over large complex networks. Delay estimation equations for the aggregated sections of a network are developed using simulation. This integrated routing & capacity management model is validated using a railway network in Los Angeles with the actual daily traffic."
