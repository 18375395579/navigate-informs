2012"This paper presents the approach and results of a joint Raytheon - U.S. Coast Guard mission analysis and experiment to evaluate mission analysis-derived decision support concepts supporting USCG missions. The objective was to identify and investigate, via mission analysis and modeling, the potential of candidate decision support aids and CONOPS to enhance maritime security. Raytheon’s Mission Profiling (Patented) approach was applied to a conceptual vessel of interest (VOI) location application."
