2008"In this talk we model the decision of when to start radiation therapy (RT) in prostate cancer patients who are undergoing neoadjuvant hormone therapy. We develop and validate a dynamic Kalman filter model for within patient serial PSA values. Our decision making model trades off the risk of beginning RT too soon so that hormone therapy has not achieved its maximum effect vs. waiting too long to start therapy so that there is an increased risk of tumor cells becoming resistant to the treatment."
