2012"In this study, we propose a new classification algorithm based upon a set of features clustered. The features were clustered by a standard clustering algorithm followed by the classification analysis in each clustered feature. We used the simulation and real data to demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed algorithm."
