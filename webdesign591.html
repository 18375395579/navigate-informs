2012"From real world airdrop scoring data we determine critical factors that affect supply airdrop error and find that bivariate normal distributions characterize cargo airdrop error patterns.  Collateral damage risk is estimated by combining numerical integrations of fit bivariate normal distributions across rectangular representations of drop field objects impacted by bundled airdrops as they fall along a linear path."
