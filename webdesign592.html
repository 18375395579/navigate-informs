2008"We provide a comprehensive approach to measuring returns to consumer search. We base our conceptual framework of returns to search on the household production model and define returns to search as the efficiency with which consumers are able to make optimal choices. We employ Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to create a measure of returns to search. Our findings indicate that Internet users and more experienced and informed consumers tend to make more efficient choices."
