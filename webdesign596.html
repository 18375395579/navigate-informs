2007"The response to the HIV epidemic in Africa is changing from crisis management to a strategic plan. Guidelines about treatment are changing to reflect HIV management as a chronic disease. Monitoring patients with CD4 and viral load counts remain the most important tools for treatment initiation, change, and discontinuation. We present a cost-effectiveness analysis of disease monitoring strategies in South Africa using a simulation model and discuss the implications of our findings."
