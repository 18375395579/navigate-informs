2006"The likelihood that a terrorist group mounts an attack is a function of intent and capability. An approximate reasoning-based (AR) model to evaluate intent is presented.  In AR inferences are made with rule bases and variables are linguistic. The model here is a rational choice (RC) representation of terrorist decision-making. We discuss RC in the AR context and present illustrative results. Revisions to include expressive factors such as ideological obsessions are examined."
