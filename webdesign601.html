2012"Staff scheduling continues to be a vexing problem for healthcare institutions. Commonly used staff scheduling practices result in extremely large and complex scheduling problems. We present a multi-week implicit tour scheduling model that can accommodate a wide range of flexible scheduling practices. Both computational results using software from the COIN-OR project (Pyomo and CBC) as well as experience with using this model in actual hospital staffing projects will be presented."
