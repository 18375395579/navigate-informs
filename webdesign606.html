2008"The problem of classifying data in spaces with thousands of  dimensions have recently been addressed in the literature for its  importance in biomedical and computational biology applications. An  example of such applications is the analysis of gene expression data. We present a supervised learning technique based on incremental generalized eigenvalue classifier to obtain higher classification accuracy with a small training set."
