2012"We perform an empirical study that comprises multiple modeling efforts. First, we develop a response function to quantify the impact of labor and traffic on sales. Second, we propose and econometrically estimate a generic staffing heuristic. Last, we conduct counterfactual analysis in which the heuristic performs closely to the idealized optimal and outperforms existing staffing levels. Our major contribution is to quantify the benefits of planning labor based on sales as well as traffic."
