2012"Good analysis is not enough to define success in a decision analysis (DA) engagement. Good communication of analytical results helps stakeholders to understand, accept and implement recommendations. DA itself provides several useful frameworks for approaching the decision of how to communicate. Standard communication techniques in DA engagements can be improved further by drawing on insights from other areas of management practice."
