2008"A lockup period in a hedge fund is a time period after making the investment during which the investor cannot freely redeem his investment, which has been growing longer recently.  We develop a Markov chain model to estimate a premium from this extended lockup period. We fit the Markov chain model to hedge fund data and quantify the way the lockup premium depends on the model parameters."
