2012"We propose a model that expresses log mortality rate changes as an age group dependent linear transformation of a mortality index. The mortality index is modeled as a Normal Inverse Gaussian. We demonstrate, with an exhaustive set of experiments and data sets spanning 11 countries over 100 years, that the proposed model significantly out performs existing models."
