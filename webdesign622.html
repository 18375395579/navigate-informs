2013"An optimization model is proposed for passenger assignment in schedule-based transit networks. The model uses logit route choice and takes into account transit vehicles capacity to model user behavior more realistically. A simulation-based assignment algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently and application in a large network is provided."
