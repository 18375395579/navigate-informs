2013"Based on the literature of risk prediction models, patient’s  socioeconomic and diagnosis factors are related to the risk of readmission.In this paper we propose two patient-specific classification methods1)A multi-level logistic random regression and2)A bootstrapped random forest that can perform sampling at the patient level. We validate and compare our proposals with a large inpatient data set from four VA facilities in the state of Michigan."
