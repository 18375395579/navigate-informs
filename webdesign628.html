2007"The incidence and severity of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia increase with age in association with a progressive decline in cell-mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV).  Vaccination against VZV decreases the incidence and severity of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia among older adults. We used a discrete event simulation model to determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating against VZV in older adults in British Columba."
