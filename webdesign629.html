2013"Accurate show-up probabilities are critical in determining appropriate overbooking levels. Traditionally, show-up probabilities are forecasted at the flight-cabin level. With abundant PNR data nowadays, show-up probabilities can be forecasted at the PNR level using passenger, trip, and segment information. Multiple regression models are evaluated. Comparing with our current method, the best model improves the forecast accuracy by as much as 25%."
