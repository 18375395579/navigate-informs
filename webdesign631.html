2012"In time series classification, nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers lack the aspect of interpretability since they are based on the similarity of the whole time series although temporal relations within the time series are important. We present an exploratory approach that finds the regions of the time series that have potentially representative patterns used for classification based on a local importance measure. Our algorithm provides comparable and interpretable results than competitive methods."
