2008"Development of reliable bio-sensors hinges on the accuracy of their calibration and preredictions.  For example, when comparing predictions for a set of glucose measurements based on surface-enhanced Raman spectra least-square and partial-least-square models have been used.  We develop new robsut models for estimating glucose concentrations from sensor measurements with two important features: namely, generating an estimate range, and incorporating data uncertainty."
