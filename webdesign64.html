2007"We describe a method for simulating daily counts from multivariate syndromic timeseries with a specified statistical structure, including autocorrelation, covariance, day-of-week, and seasonality. The method can also mimic an existing syndromic dataset, thereby creating new datasets with the same statistical properties but no privacy concerns. Methods for outbreak simulation are also considered."
