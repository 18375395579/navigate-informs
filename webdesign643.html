2008"The objective of this study is to investigate the stochastic optimization model which determines an optimal surgery schedule of elective patients with consideration of uncertain surgery activity. The sample average approximation (SAA) method is used for obtaining an optimal surgery schedule with respect to minimizing the total cost that consists of patients-related costs and overtime cost. A computational study is presented to evaluate the significance of the stochastic surgery scheduling model."
