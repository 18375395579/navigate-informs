2006"The coding theory examples presented in Bruce Hajek's Markov Lecture will be used to illuminate the possibilities for building a parsimonious and accurate differential equations model, in cases where a simple combinatorial algorithm is applied to a large (usually sparse) data set. Suitable references and study materials will be suggested for those wishing to try fluid limits."
