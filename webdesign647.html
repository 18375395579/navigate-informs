2008"Effective management of convicted sex offenders is a challenging problem. Recent legislation uses geographic constraints to limit the residential options of convicted sex offenders.  Critics suggest that communities with less rigorous ordinances absorb a disproportionately high number of offenders, putting sensitive populations at risk.  This paper uses spatial optimization to evaluate spatial risk and the geographic distribution of sex offenders within a community in relation to public policy."
