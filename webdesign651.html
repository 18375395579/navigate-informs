2008"This talk describes a significant study carried out at Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria BC, Canada involving surgical scheduling and its impact on downstream ward utilization.  We developed a portable MS EXCEL based simulation model (BUS) which we combined with an integer program to help surgical planners reduce ward congestion.  Results from the project are currently being used within the health authority."
