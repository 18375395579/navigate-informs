2007"This paper compares methodology and performance of four different kinds of freight assignment mechanisms, including the simple “all-or-nothing?assignment, user-equilibrium assignment (SUE), feedback loop between distribution and assignment (LDA), and the advanced combined distribution and assignment (CDA). It uses the freight movement in Southern California as empirical case to examine these mechanisms."
