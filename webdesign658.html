2012"This study proposes a new probabilistic model updating method used to improve the prediction capability of a finite element analysis (FEA) model of structural damages with experimental observations from a sensor network. A controlled damage experiment on a composite panel showed that the proposed model updating approach achieves a prediction accuracy that is superior to existing calibration approaches."
