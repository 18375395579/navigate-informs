2012"We propose a generalized Nash equilibrium model for an economic network of interlinked oligopolistic markets. Firms in the network supply a homogeneous product to meet both home and foreign demands in a noncollaborative way under trading limit regulations. We develop an algorithm for the sensitivity analysis of model parameters such as trade quotas and tariff rates, allowing us to investigate the firms?strategic behavior in competition and providing a guide for appropriate trade restrictions."
