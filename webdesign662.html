2012"We have developed a modeling framework to quantify the load on the power grid due to electric vehicles (EVs) in a metropolitan area during the course of a day. Our analysis uses driving patterns as an input and utilizes the data from publicly available surveys conducted in the US. We use this information to optimize the placement of public charging stations. The analysis also allows us to determine the percentage of households that are candidates for adopting EVs given the current technology."
