2007"This paper proposes a kurtosis correction (KC) method for constructing the X-bar and R control charts for symmetrical long-tailed distributions. These charts are similar to the traditional Shewhart control charts, and are derived based on the degree of kurtosis estimated from the actual (subgroup) data. In a subsequent paper, we also propose a range quantile approximation (RQA) method for the R charts, and provide the tables for the R chart constants for the leptokurtic and normal distributions."
