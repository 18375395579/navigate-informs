2008"This paper presents a novel approach for adaptively generating synthetic minority classes based on SMOTE. The main idea is to assign different weighted distribution for each minority class during the up-sampling process. Therefore, this approach can reduce the bias of the data set as well as forcing the learning algorithms to focus more on the minority classes that are relatively more difficult to learn. Simulation results shows improvement in the prediction accuracy and F-values."
