2008"We present a DDDAS simulation and optimization framework for wildland fire containment called DEVS-FIRE. DEVS-FIRE integrates fire behavior simulation for generating fire spread scenarios, stochastic programming for initial attack to compute the optimal mix of firefighting resources to deploy to multiple bases, and then which of the resources to dispatch to multiple fire scenarios, and fire suppression simulation to evaluate the dispatch plans under realistic firefighting tactics."
