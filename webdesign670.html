2013"A main challenge in demand modeling is to strike a balance between flexibility (ability to extrapolate) and performance (prediction accuracy) while keeping the model computationally tractable. We strike this balance through a new two-stage demand model: customers first pick a consideration set (a smaller subset of "relevant" products) and then choose the most preferred product from the consideration set. We propose techniques to estimate these models from purchase transaction data."
