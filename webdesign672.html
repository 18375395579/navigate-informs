2013"Equity concerns associated with various pricing schemes in the domain of transportation systems have garnered increased attention in the recent past. We propose an income-based toll pricing approach to simultaneously maximize the toll revenue and address the income equity concerns in the context of HOT lanes. The problem is formulated as a bi-level program and agent-based modeling is used to determine the toll prices."
