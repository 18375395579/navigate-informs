2013"We study the impact of two major psychological barriers to mass adoption of EVs, range and resale anxieties. Using a stylized model and a case study, we compare four business models in practice and obtain implications of consumer anxieties to parties involved in the EV industry. We show that the combination of battery owning and enhanced charging service, referred to as the (O,E) model, typically yields the best balance among the objectives of mass adoption, profitability, and consumer surplus."
