2007"Use Condition assessments for reliability typically require fitting an empirical model based on accelerated testing and extrapolating results to a less severe environmental condition.  This presentation explores the importance of experimental design selection in fitting non-linear response surfaces for reliability testing with heavy censoring.  Sensitivity analysis for sample size and interval sampling will be examined though a numerical study and compared to alphabetic optimization techniques."
