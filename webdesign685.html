2013"We model the multifaceted impact of pricing decisions in B2B and show how a seller can develop optimal inter-temporal targeted pricing strategies, taking into account the latent B2B relationships. We model the B2B customer’s purchase decisions in an integrated hierarchical Bayesian framework, with a multivariate non-homogeneous hidden Markov model. We estimate our model on data from an industrial retailer, and find two latent relationship states - a “vigilant?state and a more “relaxed?state."
