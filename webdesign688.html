2008"Monitoring and diagnosis of process variance based on multivariate quality measurement data is challenging.  Existing approaches are mainly applied in univariate processes and provide limited diagnosis capability.   This research proposes a method to project multivariate data to a set of pre-estimated spatial patterns that correspond to potential variation sources."
