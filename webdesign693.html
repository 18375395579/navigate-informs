2012"Network flows have been traditionally used to redesign individual infrastructures.   We formulate an integrated layered network model to represent the interdependencies among multiple infrastructures and evaluate design choices (increasing capacity or a new link). The objective is to reduce the vulnerability of the overall system to natural and man-made disasters while respecting budget constraints over a planning horizon. Numerical studies will be presented."
