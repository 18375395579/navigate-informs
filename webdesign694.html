2013"A respiratory-gated (RG) method allows patients with lung tumors to breathe normally in PET/CT scan while minimizing respiratory motion effects. However, not all patients can benefit from the RG method. We constructed a prediction model to predict the effectiveness of the RG method on each individual patient only using features extracted from respiratory motion traces. The technique can be used to classify patient groups and assign the most appropriate strategy for each patient in PET/CT scan."
