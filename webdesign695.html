2013"The use of Benchmark Dose Estimation has dramatically increased over the past decade. Many US government agencies and research laboratories use benchmark dose methodology to estimate the allowable dose of hazardous agents. The main drawback of this methodology is that a dose-response curve must be specified in order to estimate the benchmark dose. Herein, we illustrate an alternative to specifying one benchmark dose curve and utilized Bayesian model-averaging."
