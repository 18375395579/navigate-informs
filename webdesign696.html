2012"This study proposes a mathematical model for the dynamics of information propagation in large-scale vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications based traffic networks. The proposed model aims to obtain a better understanding of the interacting processes of information propagation and the dynamics of traffic flow. Insights will be illustrated using the results obtained through the mathematical modeling and the simulated data."
