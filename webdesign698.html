2012"The large strongyle Strongylus vulgaris is the most pathogenic among strongyle nematodes that are ubiquitous in grazing horses. Decades of frequent anthelmintic treatment have reduced the prevalence of this parasite dramatically. As the concern over increasing resistancein cyathostomin parasites has led to implementation of selective therapy to reduce the frequency of anthelmintic treatment, it has been conjectured that S. vulgaris could re-emerge. Past statistical studies have shown that the prevalence of S. vulgaris at horse and farm levelare significantly higher in farms using selective therapy than in farms not using selective therapy. Lack of any valid biological model to ex propose to use a statistical model-based simulation approach to study the effect of selective therapy on there-emergence of S. vulgaris in farms using selective therapy."
