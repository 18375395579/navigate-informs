2012"This study presents an approach that has explicitly considered the effects of seismic hazards in biofuel supply chain design. A quantitative assessment framework of resilience, measured by system performance impact and recovery effort, has been integrated into the stochastic modeling framework for disruption risk. A case study of biofuel infrastructure system planning in California shows that with this resilience design the system becomes more resilience and cost effective under seismic risk."
