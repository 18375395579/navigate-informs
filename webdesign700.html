2013"The increasing demands on green energy source have significantly pushed the application and development of Li-Ion batteries forward. To accomondate their wide applications, it is also necessary to accurately model their degradation and predict their remaining useful lives (RUL). In this article, we proposed a varying coefficient model to indirectly characterize the battery capacity degradation from its discharging profiles."
