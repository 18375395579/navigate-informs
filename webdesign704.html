2012"In this paper we explore enabling effect of information systems (IS) on triple bottom-line, economic, environmental and social sustainability. Earlier research identified the need for research methodologies that account for uncertainty and feedback. Analytical Network Process (ANP) methodology based benefits, opportunities, cost and risk framework we propose fills this gab and can evaluate both quantitative and qualitative sustainability indicators identified in literature."
