2013"Event detection in social media is an important but challenging problem. Existing approaches focus on burst detection, topic modeling, or clustering techniques, which cannot model the heterogeneous network structure in social media. This paper converts the network in to a “sensor?network, proposes non-parametric scan statistics to model the heterogeneity, and develops efficient non-parametric scanning algorithms for event detection. Validations were conducted on real-life twitter data sets."
