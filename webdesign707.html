2012"We develop a novel principal–agent model by integrating elements of the machine repairman model and a stochastic financial distress model within the double-sided moral hazard framework to study a firm's problem of contract design for outsourcing repair services. Our analysis provides normative guidelines to managers on the structure of optimal repair contracts. We also provide theoretical support for the extensive use of tiered contracts in practice."
