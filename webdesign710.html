2013"Willingness to pay (WTP) of customers for a product plays an anchoring role in determining pricing policies of a firm. We propose a WTP-based choice model, which also explicitly models preferences of a customer. Using real-life data, we compare the performance of the proposed model with the multi-choice logit model."
