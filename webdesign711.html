2013"Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models are commonly used to analyze the spread of epidemic, pandemic and infectious diseases. In this paper, we shed some light on the arrival process of patients at a hospital due to an epidemic. We modify a Markovian SIR model by assuming that infected patients seek help at a hospital at an exponential rate. We present a recursive formulation for the calculation of the Laplace transforms for the interarrival times for the sequence of patients seeking help."
