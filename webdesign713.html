2012"In multicriteria problems, decision-makers (DM) normally feel difficult to evaluate alternatives under qualitative criteria. Commonly, the elicitation process uses a fixed nominal scale. This paper presents a decision support system which performs a ‘playing cards?procedure, facilitating to rank alternatives and also introducing a cardinal notion. The system allows quantify the alternatives based on their rank position, without requires a fixed scale size."
