2013"In a sponsored search auction, decisions about ranking ads impose tradeoffs between objectives. We argue that the natural solution concept to evaluate these tradeoffs is the lowest SNE by generalizing the connection between the lowest SNE and the VCG outcome. We then propose a new ranking algorithm that uses a reserve price to order the ads (not just to filter them). Finally, we examine the tradeoffs through simulations and show that our algorithm enables superior operating points."
