2013"A finite element (FE) simulation is used to predict Young’s modulus of PVA-treated CNT buckypaper. Some input variable in the FE simulation is unobservable in the experiments. A latent variable analysis is developed to combine experiment outputs with simulation results, treating the unobservable variable as latent variable. A formulation for this latent variable analysis problem is presented, and a solution procedure based on non-linear optimization is developed."
