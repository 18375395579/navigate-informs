2007"Because of their familiarity to managers, spreadsheets have been suggested as preferable to specialized mathematical packages for optimization modeling in some contexts. However, spreadsheets often require extensive use of VBA to accommodate large models. Thus, for large models the choice is not a specialized package vs. simple Excel, but rather a specialized package vs. very complex Excel and VBA. We discuss the pros and cons of this decision and suggest the best approach in various situations."
