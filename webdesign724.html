2006"In recent times, credit markets have grown and research has been focused on modeling of default events for multi-firms.  Most of these models rely on simulation for the pricing of derivatives. We consider one such class of models; specifically the intensity driven doubly stochastic processes and propose an asymptotically optimal change of measure for efficient simulation. We apply our result to specific models and support our theory with numerical simulations."
