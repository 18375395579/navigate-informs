2008"We propose a new method for detecting groups of anomalies.  Our approach is a generalization of the spatial scan statistic. We extend this framework to non-spatial data sets with discrete valued attributes by modeling the relationship between the attributes using a Bayesian Network. We show that this algorithm is able to accurately detect anomalous groups in real-world hospital, container shipping and network connections data."
