2013"The role of a network’s topology in its resilience to disaster events caused by a host of possible hazard types is studied herein. Insights gleened from results of systematically designed numerical experiments employing a developed modeling framework and appropriate adaptations to consider a variety of resilience measures provide a basis for the characterization of highly resilient network topologies and identification of network attributes that might lead to poorly performing systems."
