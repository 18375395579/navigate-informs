2012"The problem of determining the fleet size and location of shared-use electric vehicle stations is modeled as a combined maximal covering inventory model. An efficient algorithm is used for solving the proposed model. We report results from the application of the model and algorithm to a real world problem with electric vehicles in the city of Nice."
