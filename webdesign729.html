2012"Given the increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes, it is important to develop efficient strategies for evacuating evacuees. In this work, we present a heuristic approach to redesign the network with limited budget. Both temporal and spatial variations of the contraflow design will be considered. Different scenarios will be tested and compared using an agent based simulation tool."
