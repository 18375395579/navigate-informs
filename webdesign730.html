2008"Many years ago a client taught me the subtle beauty and usefulness of a simple approach to strategy.  I’ve used this, with some elaboration, to help clients develop and maintain a ‘big-picture?view of complex decision situations.  The model is used in multi-criteria decision analysis to connect strategy to effective action, leading one client to observe, “This shows how we can live the strategy.? A case study will illustrate this blend of strategy and MCDA."
