2012"A style is an organizing principle based on categorizing visually similar designs into a describable concept. This paper presents a structured approach to identifying styles using cluster analysis. Design patent data provides a unique opportunity to analyze style on a large scale due to a tightly controlled citation process which conveys similarity in visual impression between designs. Finally, we test styles developed using this approach against theory and perceptual experiments."
