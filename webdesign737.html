2012"This talk discusses a method for sampling from the boundary of an n-dimensional convex body using Markov chains, where we think of n as being large. We analyze a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure known as the shake-and-bake algorithm. The methodology is applied to the ranking-and-selection problem from the theory of simulation."
