2013"Process monitoring and fault diagnosis using multichannel profile data remain an important problem in SPC. Motivated by a real application, this research develops a new monitoring and diagnosis framework for phase-I analysis of multichannel profiles. The proposed framework incorporates multi-dimensional functional principal component analysis into change-point models. The proposed methodology is validated via simulation and a case study."
