2012"Desire rather than reason often governs behavior. People generally want to be comfortable; therefore, management decisions are frequently made based on what has been proven through past experience to be effective.  When past experience does not exist or has led to poor outcomes, Management Sciences can support speculation by maximizing functional integration through the application of advanced analytical methods. Assisting individuals with evaluating resources and structuring engagement in order to facilitate indulgence in speculation requires the establishment of a priori conditions that go well beyond the bounds of sense or association: resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect.    The outbreak of the rare and deadly Ebola virus killed several people in July 2012 in Midwestern Uganda. The strain of the virus was identified as Ebola Sudan, which in recent years has killed at a rate often above 70 percent of those infected. While outbreaks of different strands of Ebola occur every few years, the virus’s delicate composition has impeded a sustained attack. But much about the disease, including its origins and cure, remain unknown and in this case, Ugandan authorities did not initially detect an Ebola outbreak because patients weren't showing typical symptoms of the lethal virus.   Health organizations must reasonably comprehend the impact of a virus and, with confidence, manage an outbreak.  To accomplish this, they must understand or predict the time evolution of the virus.  In July, the particular Ebola-Sudan strain was comparatively mild to previous strains and therefore, less likely to stamp itself out.  Infectious diseases evolve over time; the use of  applied math and science has the ability to improve rational, meaningful forecasts of virulence leading  to more efficient and effective management decisions which optimize  the probability of making a practical impact. In this scenario, use of non-linear delay-differential equation describing the time evolution of the increment in the number of infectious individuals may assist with establishing virility and regression modeling can assist with establishing causation. Providing a link between past or present experiences with events that we can predict should facilitate a decrease in morbidity and mortality based on reason as result of rules-based activity."
