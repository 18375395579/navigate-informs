2013"Line Cancelling Transactions (LCTs) can model the impact of transmission line switching on injection sensitivity factors [Guller, Gross and Liu,  2007].  Moreover, LCTs have been incorporated in a MILP topology control optimization algorithm (TCA) demonstrating orders of magnitude higher efficiency over previously used B Theta algorithms (Ruiz et al. 2012). We will present extensions to LCT-based TCA algorithms that model Losses, and report on large (multiple thousand buses) System applications."
