2012"We consider finding the undiscovered defects by using mathematical and statistical model in the steel mill product factory. In this study, we focus on the data of processing time at each process since it may correlate with the level of defectiveness. First, we make a mathematical model including “normal?and “abnormal?distribution. Then we estimate the defect rate for each process based on the source of defects, and find the optimal process planning to achieve the defect reduction."
