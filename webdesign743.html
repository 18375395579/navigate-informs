2006"Using concepts arising in control variates, we propose estimating gradients using Monte Carlo data from a single design point.  Our goal is to create a statistically efficient estimator that is easy to implement, with no analysis within the simulation oracle and no unknown algorithm parameters.  We compare an early version to finite differences and simultaneous perturbation."
