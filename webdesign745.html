2013"We analyze the location problem of a battery-switching infrastructure provider for the deployment of electric vehicles. Using a simple population model of motorists and an economic model of provider-firm behavior, we find the optimal number of switching stations and their location. Our analysis captures tthe trade-off between number of stations and service level at these stations. We calibrate our model with reasonable parameter values and evaluate the feasibility of this business model."
