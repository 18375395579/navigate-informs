2006"Little work has been devoted to the development of the automated decision support for machining operation, to support surface roughness quality control when qualitative data is taken into consideration. This presentation demonstrates a data mining based hybrid approach to control surface quality while qualitative data is involved. The approach consists of a novel rough-set algorithm for feature selection and an enhanced binary-class support vector machines (SVMs) method for accurate prediction."
