" 2 - Toward a Complete Active Tomography Framework"
Earl Lawrence, Los Alamos National Laboratory, earl@lanl.gov"
2007"Active network tomography is concerned with inferring link-level packet metrics in a network based upon end-to-end probing.  There are two outstanding problems.  The first is the need for a framework that can model loss and empty-queue probabilities with a flexible continuous component for the heavy-tailed delays.  The second problem is the need for a spatio-temporal modeling component.  I will discuss the use of mixture models in the first problem and a multivariate probit model in the second."
