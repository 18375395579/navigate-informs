2008"A general modeling framework for dynamic re-routing of resources responding to battlespace changes (e.g. appearance of a new threat or loss of a resource) is presented.  We demonstrate the model in the context of cooperative intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions involving multiple manned and unmanned aircraft systems.  Examples and computational results are discussed."
