2012"Optimizing search patterns has long been a focus in the OR community, and it is generally accomplished in two veins: probabilistic analysis to develop a fixed pattern or automated learning to direct progress. But is it possible that the two could meet in the middle? In this talk we describe an approach that does just this. By merging the behavioral elements of game theory with the policy optimization of MDPs, our combined approach finds smarter search paths by allowing real-time updates."
