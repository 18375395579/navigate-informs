2006"This study combines a dedicated simulation tool with an optimization model to improve ED patient flow. First the ED bottleneck is identified using the ED simulation, next the optimization model develops an efficient schedule. Since analytical models can't capture all the intricate interrelations between the ED components, the simulation tool is used to analyze the suggested schedule and asses the ED's operational parameters. This process is repeated until certain operational goals are reached."
