2008"When product quality characteristics are evaluated by exclusive categories, measure errors (misclassification) always exist. A categorical controller has been developed for R2R process adjustment with categorical variables. However, if process outputs are misclassified, an adjustment bias will be introduced by the controller. In this research, an improved categorical R2R controller is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed controller performs better when misclassification exists."
