2013"A robust simulation-based optimization approach is proposed for truck-shovel systems in surface coal mines to maximize the revenue.  A large coal mine is taken as case study and its highly detailed simulation model is constructed.  Response Surface Methodology is then applied to the simulation model to derive variance of revenue under the influence of controllable and uncontrollable factors.  The proposed approach results in higher and robust revenues compared with historical revenues."
