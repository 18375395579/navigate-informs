2012"We propose a systematic model to model and predict the shrinkage process to address the accuracy problem for Stereolithography (SLA, one technique for 3-D printing), instead of the traditional finite element simulation or experimental trial-and-error methods. A variant of Latin Square experimental design is employed to identify the process model and the experimental outcomes are analyzed for optimized compensation. One case study is presented to verify the shrinkage model and compensation."
