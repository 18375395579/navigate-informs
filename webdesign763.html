2008"The cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart is widely used to detect a shift in the parameter of the underlying probability distribution of the quality characteristic. In this work, an optimal design of CUSUM charts is studied when the shift size is random with a known probability distribution. Based on several performance criteria, the optimally designed CUSUM chart is compared to other available control charts by using the simulation method."
