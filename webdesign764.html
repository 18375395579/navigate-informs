2007"The Average Run Length (ARL) is an important measure used to evaluate the performance of statistical control charts. Unfortunately, for multivariate autocorrelated processes, there does not exist a numerical way for ARL computation and literature was heavily based on simulations. In this presentation, a general class of Markov chain models is developed for ARL computations for multivariate autocorrelated processes represented by linear time series models."
