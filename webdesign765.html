2013"In the paper addresses the rescheduling problem by an airline when a ground delay program (GDP) is issued. The objective is to minimize delay measures and cost for crew and passenger misconnections subject to several restrictions. A new linear integer model is presented. Using a real-world example we show the efficiency of the modeling approach. High quality solutions can be found quickly and management can use the model to evaluate the trade-off between delays and misconnections."
