2013"We use a capacity expansion model with unit commitment constraints to find the socially optimal generation mix for a given penetration of intermittent renewables. For this mix, we calculate hourly day-ahead prices and cash flows for all units in the system under alternative market rules for treating startup costs.  We demonstrate the impacts of operating a mix with more renewables than it was designed for. Results from this analysis will allow assessing the shortcomings of current market rules."
