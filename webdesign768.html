2006"We model and solve the vendor selection problem in two steps. In first step cluster analysis is used to pre-classify the vendors as favorable or unfavorable.

In second step multi-objective techniques are used to solve the supplier selection problem, with price, lead-time and quality as the three conflicting objective."
