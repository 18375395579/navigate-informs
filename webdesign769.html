2012"We investigate the stability of a cartel gathering the main natural gas exporting countries. Our analysis uses a deterministic, discrete-time, finite-horizon oligopoly model capable to determine investment and production equilibrium strategies, in a setting where the demand's specification takes into consideration the adjustment dynamics of current consumption to both present and past prices. We assume a dynamic hierarchical pricing model ?la Stackelberg with a feedback information structure."
