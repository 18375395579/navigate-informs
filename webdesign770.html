2008"We develop an approach to integrate a computable general equilibrium model of the economy with detailed representation of energy systems (the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis Model) to a terrestrial  biogeochemistry model (the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model). We used the integrated system to investigate the implications of the development of a global second generation biofuels industry for land use and the carbon emissions that result from land conversion."
