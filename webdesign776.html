2008"Lipid abnormalities increase the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke for patients with Type 2 diabetes and can be treated by statins with some potential side effects. We formulate the optimal timing of statin initiation problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process. We present several structural properties of the model and compare individualized treatment policies between patients with varying risk factors. We also present computational results based on clinical data."
