2006"The problem of scheduling clearcut harvests under adjacency constraints, simultaneous with road construction decisions, is addressed using a mixed integer optimization model. The model allows an unrestricted road network with multiple exit points. Computational results show that it is possible to solve models of practical size using a commercial solver."
