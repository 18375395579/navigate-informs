2007"In this talk we present a system, Sherlock, that uses machine learning techniques for detecting accounting fraud and error in a company's general ledger data. In developing Sherlock, we addressed challenges in creating efficient processes for using data from heterogeneous sources, learning classification models with few known cases of fraud and in evaluating the effectiveness of our methods. We also show how anomaly detection complements the classification approach when using unlabeled data."
