2013"We survey the CFOs of the 1500 largest companies from Scandinavia to study use of real options. Only 23 of the 384 respondents use real options. Large companies with high capital expenditures and high R&D intensity are more likely to use the method. Lack of familiarity is the most important reason for non-use.  70% of respondents are not familiar with real options. For those familiar with the framework, the complexity of real options analysis is the main hinder for implementation."
