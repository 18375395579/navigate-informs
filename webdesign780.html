2007"We used discrete event simulation to model the spread of pandemic influenza in San Antonio under varying public health mitigation strategies to assess the adequacy of the surge capacity of the health care delivery system. A mix of strategies ?social distancing, use of antiviral medications, and vaccination ?could limit the demand for care to levels that could be satisfied by existing capacity, as could timely and aggressive use of social distancing alone, if other strategies are unavailable."
