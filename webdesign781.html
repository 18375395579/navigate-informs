2012"Measurement and verification (M&V) can add significant cost to building energy efficiency projects and often produce energy savings evaluations that lack credibility.  We introduce an improved M&V method applying Gaussian Process (GP) modeling that can, using less measured data, capture nonlinear energy behavior and quantify prediction uncertainty.  A case study demonstrates the strengths of GP models for M&V and further explores their potential for analyzing different time resolution data."
