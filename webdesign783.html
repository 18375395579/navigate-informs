2013"This research proposes mathematical description models to capture information propagation delay in a connected vehicle network running on a two-way road.  Intermittent wireless communication under dynamic traffic flow condition, and wireless communication interference among vehicles are integrated into the model development. The proposed models are validated are simulation experiments"
