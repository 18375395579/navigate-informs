2012"A Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm determines a calibrated set of model parameters, using coefficients that affect performance in terms of convergence and quality. General guidelines are available to select numeric values of these coefficients; however, the SPSA algorithm often requires specific coefficients for each particular optimization problem. A bi-level optimization framework is proposed to calibrate model parameters and fine-tune the coefficients, using a fuzzy logic model."
