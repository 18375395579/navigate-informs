2006"Given a syntactically correct process sequence, errors can still occur during workflow execution due to incorrect data flow specifications. However, there are no formal methodologies are available for systematically discovering data flow errors in a workflow model. In this paper, we provide a data flow perspective for detecting data flow anomalies such as missing data, redundant data, and potential data conflicts."
