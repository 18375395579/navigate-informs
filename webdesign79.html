2013"Bayesian testing and some well-known reliability models involve singular distributions. The traditional indices of relationship fail to distinguish the dependence of singular models such as Marshall-Olkin and the exponential autoregressive bivariate distributions. The information measure of dependence is not defined.  A weighted average of the mutual information indices for the singular and absolutely continuous parts provides a common metric for comparing the dependence of these models."
