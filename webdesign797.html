2007"We develop a structural model to measure the effect of stock-outs on retail sales. We use a random coefficient logit model of consumer choice and estimate it using Bayesian methods. The methodology is tested using actual data on sales and availability of a product category (shampoo) collected from multiple stores of a Spanish retailer."
