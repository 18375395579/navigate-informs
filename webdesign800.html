2007"Many prominent models of decision theory assume an ordinal structure on individual choice probabilities.  Yet, empirically testing whether observable data could have arisen from such choice probabilities has proven to be a considerable challenge to researchers.   We present a statistical methodology to test choice probabilities under linear inequality constraints.  An application of this methodology provides a test of decision axioms defined by unions of convex polytopes."
