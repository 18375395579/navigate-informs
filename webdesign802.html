2012"This research presents a novel methodology to estimate the number of empty trips useful for regional freight planning. This methodology is based on a time expanded network flow approach that captures behavioral and operational characteristics of the carriers. The model is formulated as a linear optimization problem that minimizes the system costs associated to truck trips. The model is validated with a commercial vehicle survey from Colombia."
