2013"We use data envelopment analysis, analytical hierarchy process, and TOPSIS as methods to identify key nodes in a social network across all metrics. We illustrate our results using two common networks from the literature. We discuss some basic sensitivity analysis can may be applied to the methods. We find the TOPSIS method as the most flexible method to weight the criterion based upon the decision makers?inputs or the topology of the network."
