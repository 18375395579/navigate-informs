2008"A simulation modeling approach has been developed to represent computer networks and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to efficiently simulate cyber attack scenarios. This flexible modeling framework is based in Java and enables simulation of various network structures, services, and IDS configurations. The outcome of the simulation model is a set of IDS alerts that can be used to test and evaluate cyber security systems including information fusion methods."
