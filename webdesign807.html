2006"Computer simulations are useful for planning improved responses to large-scale, complex disasters, which, due to their magnitude and multiple contingencies, are impractical to study in physical role-playing simulations. D4S2 integrates agent-based simulation, geographic information systems and discrete event simulation in a decision support tool for designing emergency response protocols."
