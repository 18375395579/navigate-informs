2007"NS has recently developed a strategic fleet planning model to be able to better account for long-term demand trends and global budget constraints in the fleet planning process. The application uses simulation to estimate the demand for each type of rail car, and then models 30 years of decision-making as a mixed-integer program. In this talk we will discuss the impacts of the fleet planning model on the business process, and we will summarize the lessons learned in developing such a model."
