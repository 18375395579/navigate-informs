2012"We propose a factor-based model that incorporates common factor shocks for the security returns. Under these realistic factor dynamics, we solve for the dynamic trading policy in the class of linear policies analytically. Our model can accommodate stochastic volatility and liquidity costs as a function of factor exposures. Calibrating our model with empirical data, we show that our trading policy achieves superior performance in the presence of common factor shocks."
