2007"Integrating quantity decisions into the choice framework is essential to overcome the selectivity bias and infer consumer behavior more accurately.  We propose a multivariate tobit model that simultaneously accounts for purchase incidence and quantity decisions of consumers across multiple categories.  We estimate a Hierarchical Bayes econometric specification of this complex model using MCMC methods.  Scanner panel data across several categories are used for model calibration."
