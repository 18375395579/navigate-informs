2008"Spatial patterns on wafer defect maps contain valuable information of the manufacturing processes. In this paper, we proposed a method to construct control chart for spatial pattern detection based on Hough Transform. Properties of the monitored statistic have been analyzed and the impact of Hough quantization parameters on Type II error rates has been studied."
