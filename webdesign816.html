2013"We build a synthetic population model of transient and resident populations in Washington DC and study the impact of transients on flu epidemics. We focus interventions on reducing disease spread in major tourist destinations, which can have 80,000 visits per day. Surprisingly, promoting practices to reduce disease spread (such as hand sanitizer use) is more effective than closing down the museums entirely. We also present an explicit form of the reproductive number and a stability analysis."
