2013"We present a method that interactively places alternatives into preference categories (e.g. most, somewhat and least preferred). We assume the decision maker has a linear value function and her responses are prone to error. In each step of the algorithm, we ask the decision maker to place an alternative in a category and using this information, we update our estimate of her value function via MCMC.  We compare our method to other algorithms in the literature that assume away response errors."
