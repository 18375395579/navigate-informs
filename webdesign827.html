2006"In a domain of actions and communications, we investigate how constraints on capabilities influence the ability to achieve certain tasks. Our mathematical method of choice is Formal Concept Analysis: We interpret tasks as objects and capabilities as attributes; we then derive hidden dependencies between capabilities via the lattice of formal concepts. Finally, we extend our model using Reflexive Theory to demonstrate how wrongly perceived constraints may influence the decision making process."
