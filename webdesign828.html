2013"One of the major challenges of calibrating a sensor array lies in the typically large samples required to estimate a high-quality multivariate calibration (MC) model, which functionally relates the array responses to the analyte concentrations. This work develops a multi-stage procedure to guide the optimal sampling in a sequential manner. The design optimization at each stage seeks to optimize the quality of the MC model, and is performed based on the new statistical inference method."
