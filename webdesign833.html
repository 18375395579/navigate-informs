2013"In an effort to reduce costs, many hospitals have reduced the numbers of available in-patient beds. One alternative policy for reducing congestion is to establish a discharge center which can more efficiently process standard discharge of in-patients and thereby free beds for use by other patients.  We evaluate the usefulness of a discharge model through the adaptation of a patient flow simulation model of an entire hospital."
