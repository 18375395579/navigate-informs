2008"In our work on workforce management for IT support systems, we encountered the joint use of both preemptive and non-preemptive priority protocols. We present theoretical research on a queueing model with mixed priorities that includes calculation of Laplace transforms for waiting and sojourn times. In a practical part of the research, application of mixed priorities for different types of Service Level Agreements is discussed and supported by an example based on a real-life scheduling problem."
