2013"Network simulation models are becoming common for modeling the spread of infections.  However, speed is often an issue for large populations. Choosing a discrete time simulation (DTS) over a discrete event simulation (DES) helps to remedy this problem at the cost some accuracy. We analyze and quantify the loss in accuracy for the common SI and SIS processes. Specifically we prove the DTS method for both processes converges with strong order 1, similar to Milstein’s method for SDEs."
