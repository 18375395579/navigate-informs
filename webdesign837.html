2012"We propose a framework to include local metamodels for some direct search methods for both deterministic and stochastic optimization problems to improve the algorithm efficiency without affecting the convergence.We discuss the conditions of the metamodels and the objective functions under which the effectiveness of using metamodels is guaranteed.Numerical results with a wide variety of test problems show that local metamodels can help even when the regularity conditions are not fully satisfied."
