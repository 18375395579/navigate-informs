2012"We use the pairwise amino acid sequence comparison of influenza strains and the antigenic distance between each pair as input for a classification model to identify immunodominant positions that cause antigenic variety. The performance of the model is evaluated through cross validation where cross validation is modeled as an optimization program that minimizes the misclassification error. Comparison to results of existing classification methods in literature is also provided."
