2012"An increase of “livability?depends on solutions to the issue of first/last mile access to transit. We aim to identify the feeder’s optimal cycle to maximize LOS. A case study in El Cenizo, TX has been conducted.  We are now developing a handy analytical model to obtain results, without relying on extensive simulation analyses.  Experiments appear to validate our model, which would allow decision makers to identify the best feeder transit operating design of any given residential area."
