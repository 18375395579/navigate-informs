2006"The cell transmission model and the material requirements planning are compared. Both have an exact graph structure for propagating flow (vehicles or SKUs) under capacity and congestion constraints. The modeling units (cell or facility) differentiate the spatio-temporal analysis. Common concepts, like the existence of a state variable, are highly indicative of the potential of a common modeling framework for transportation and production planning."
