" 2 - The Design of Experiential Services with Acclimation and Memory Decay: Optimal Sequence and Duration"
Aparupa Das Gupta, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America"
2013"We address the optimal sequence and duration of activities in a service encounter where customer perceptions of experience are important, as in the hospitality, leisure, and entertainment industries. We employ evidence from behavioral studies about how people evaluate past experiences. We model these phenomena parsimoniously and design service processes to maximize ex-post customer satisfaction."
