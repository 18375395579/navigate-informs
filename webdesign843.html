2008"Evacuation studies have grown in importance over the years.One effective method to evaluate different evacuation strategies is the use of simulation.In this study,we develop a computerized tool for modeling evacuation dynamics with household consolidation,and then incorporate it into a traffic-simulation software platform.This tool will allow a percentage of the population to consolidate as a family before they evacuate."
