2008"Given the recent incidents of the avian flu and the pandemic influenza cases in the history, many experts believe that a pandemic influenza is likely to happen; hence, governments and NGOs develop response plans.  Supplies and transportation services may be interrupted. To aid with planning, we model the disease spread. We then combine this with an optimization model to identify and dynamically update the locations for food distribution facilities, and test our models using data from Georgia."
