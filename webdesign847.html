2008"We describe a locomotive optimization model which allows Norfolk Southern to perform a wide range of strategic planning exercises.  The system uses approximate dynamic programming, which allows us to capture operations at a very high level of detail.  It combines the power and flexibility of Cplex to make good decisions at a point in time, while using ADP to optimize over time.  The model closely matches actual operations, and can be used for strategic, tactical and real-time planning."
