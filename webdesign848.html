2012"Scheduling of chemotherapy treatments is a difficult task due to the cyclic nature of the prescribed treatment regimen, variability of treatment lengths, and patient acuity levels.  We present a discrete event system specification (DEVS) simulation model integrated with a stochastic mixed integer programming model (SMIP) to schedule and manage patients in an oncology clinic.  Preliminary results are presented from the management perspective."
