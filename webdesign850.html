2012"IW operations are hard: they connect to the human domain, where our knowledge is weak. Recent conflicts have produced demands for models of IW. Ontologies provide a tool for representing IW. They specify vocabularies & semantic relationships.  We show ontologies of IW actor, action, & environment concepts and state variables.  They come from several sources. The semantics permit programmatic inferencing. The ontologies are useful for modeling, data interchange, interoperability, and V&V."
