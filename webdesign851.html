2012"In this talk, we propose an efficiency-based asset selection methodology that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA), a non-parametric productivity analysis of relative efficiencies of economic entities, with fundamental analysis in a disciplined manner.  We test our strategy in both equity and currency markets and evaluate its performance relative to market benchmarks and widely used regression-based techniques."
