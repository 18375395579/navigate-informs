2008"The major clinical decision in living-donor liver transplantation is the appropriate time to transplant. We use a Markov decision process model parameterized with clinical data to optimize the timing of the transplant decision for a given end-stage liver disease patient with a living-donor. We compare the timing decision suggested by this model, which maximizes patient’s total discounted life expectancy, to the actual transplant decision of the patient and present the results for 721 patients."
