2012"Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend short-term antiretroviral treatment for healthy, HIV+ pregnant women (Option B), but a longer course of therapy (Option B+) may reduce vertical transmission in future pregnancies, improve maternal outcomes, and be more cost-effective. We develop a state-transition Markov model, calibrated to HIV demographics and behavior in Ghana, to evaluate alternative treatment scenarios. The analysis aims to help inform HIV treatment policies in Ghana."
