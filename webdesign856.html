2013"Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) is a major health problem affecting up to 30-50 percent of women.Diagnosis of POP through dynamic MRI has become popular due to inaccuracies of clinical examination.We present a new segmentation approach for automating pelvic bone point identification on MRI using a multi-stage mechanism based on the texture-based block classification and K-means clustering analysis to diagnose POP on MRI."
