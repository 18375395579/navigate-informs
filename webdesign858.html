2013"Current simulation models to aid evaluation of screening strategies do not have a structure that enables the evaluation of strategies that include policies affecting screening compliance, even though such strategies are often necessary to achieve maximum cost-benefit, especially when current compliance levels are low. This research develops a model addressing the shortcoming by including compliance as a mediating variable in the model and illustrates this using the case of Diabetic Retinopathy."
