2008"The two most widely used traffic assignment objectives, the SO and the UE, have been recently modeled in CTM-based DTA model. In our research, we interpret the SO and UE routing patterns from a graph theoretic perspective by using the Graph Theoretic CTM (GT-CTM). Theoretical and practical insights are drawn for different traffic density conditions for the single destination DTA case."
