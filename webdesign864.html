2013"Heterogeneity of final product population makes the reliability modeling based on homogeneous assumption unacceptable. Such heterogeneity, conventionally modeled as unknown parameters or unobservable random variables, may be caused by the variations. This paper proposes a semi-latent hazard regression (SLHR) model to explicitly quantify the impact of manufacturing process variation on reliability heterogeneity. The advantages of applying the SLHR model in burn-in process are discussed."
