2006"We use Credit Default Swap spread data along with equity market and balance sheet information to build a next generation structural model. The model uses an incomplete information framework and provides greater flexibility in calibration compared to the Merton model. Applications include rich-cheap analysis of credits, credit portfolio monitoring, pricing less liquid names, and deriving exposures to market variables for hedging."
