2013"In hospitals nationwide, misaligned bed capacity results in ED crowding and PACU holds. We used patient admission rates, surgery schedules, bed placement rules, length of stays and capacity information from Baystate Medical Center (Springfield, MA) to develop a simulation based optimization model to improve capacity allocation of inpatient beds. Our goal is to provide efficient discharge policies to manage the inpatient bed capacity in the presence of demand and LOS variability."
