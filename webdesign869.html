2006"We consider different actual implementations of robotic cells with multiple dual gripper robots.  We provide schemes to prevent robot collisions, discuss cell layout issues, and find optimal move sequences.  Additionally, we use simulation to evaluate sequences for a cell with stochastic processing times."
