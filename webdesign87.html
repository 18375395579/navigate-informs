2006"The benefits of improving existing maintenance policies are vast, as are the associated challenges. Appropriate resource allocation is impossible without comprehensive system-level modeling of failure and repair. Dynamic interactions among factors affecting operations, degradation, and maintenance must be quantitatively accounted for. To this end, a framework based on Petri nets is introduced; it is capable of modelling imperfect inspection and maintenance, opportunistic repair, and logistics."
