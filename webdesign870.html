2008"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds most HIV prevention programs in the U.S.  To guide CDC funding decisions, we developed a resource allocation model aimed at minimizing new infections over five years. New infections are calculated using a dynamic compartmental model structured by infection status, risk group, gender and race. We discuss this model, with a focus on challenges in applying optimization models to public health issues."
