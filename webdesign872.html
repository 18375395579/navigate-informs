2013"SMART-ISO is a detailed model of day-ahead, hour-ahead and real-time electricity markets, which carefully models the flow of information, as well as notification times and ramp rates of generators.  We will report on model calibration, and the design of best-deterministic lookahead policies for robustness, as well as value function approximations for hydro storage.  Finally we will report on the results of a study of high-penetrations of off-shore wind."
