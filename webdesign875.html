" 2 - Adaptive Jackknife Estimators for Stochastic Programming"
Amit Partani, partani@mail.utexas.edu]"
2007"We discuss an adaptive jackknife estimator to reduce bias. It does not require a priori knowledge regarding the order of bias. We discuss convergence properties and apply it in the context of Monte Carlo-based simulation procedures in stochastic programming. We provide a bias reduction strategy for the optimality gap estimator of a candidate decision and optimal cost estimator based on the adaptive estimator. Computational results are presented to evaluate the performance of the adaptive estimator."
