2012"What patenting strategy should a company pursue? What factors should the choice of strategy depend on?  We build a coherent inventory of patenting strategies and we integrate it into a common coherent framework. Through a simulation model, we identify competitive dynamics as the most crucial contingency and within our framework we characterize the optimal patenting choices. Our research makes a step towards a contingency theory of patenting strategies."
