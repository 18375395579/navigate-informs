2007"Revenue management models usually focus on risk neutral decision makers. We consider an extension of the standard EMSR model where a risk averse decision maker determines the optimal allocation of capacity with the objective of maximizing utility. We obtain optimality conditions and comparative static results with respect to several parameters and compare risk averse and risk neutral allocation policies.  We report computational results on various extensions of the model."
