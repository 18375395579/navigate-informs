2012"We present a chance-constrained optimization model for incorporating uncertain generation resources into an existing grid.  The model incorporates both the uncertainty in the resources together with an optimal control scheme; this gives rise to a sparse, second-order optimization model.  We describe computational experience with several data sets and provide qualitative observations on the results.   Joint work with M. Chertkov (Los Alamos) and S. Harnett (Columbia Applied Math)."
