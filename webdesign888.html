2012"By analyzing a variety of air traffic flow management models, this paper proposes a cumulative flow count based optimization model for train scheduling problem under stochastic segment capacity breakdowns. The “capacity aggregation?technique is used to capture the uncertainty of capacity breakdown incidents. A Lagrangian relaxation based solution approach is presented to solve this model. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution approach."
