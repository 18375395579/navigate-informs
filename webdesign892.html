2007"In this talk, we present the development and field testing of an N-Curve-based approach for freeway point-to-pint travel time prediction. The main modeling challenges including the consideration of on and off ramps and the prediction accuracy under a variety of traffic congestion levels will discussed. Field testing was conducted using data collected from 10 RTMS detector data on a 7-mile long highway segment."
