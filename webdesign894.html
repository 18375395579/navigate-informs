2008"IC-Card provides a means of effecting business transactions in a flexible,secure,standard way with minimal human intervention. It has been applied to various fields: the traffic IC-Card(Suica,Pasmo,Mobile),Electronic Money(Edy),Credit Card,ID Card. This paper describes IC-Card system's efficient improvement direction by theoretical study of IC-Card system's technical simulation model analysis. This study would contribute to scientific reaserch and enhance the value of IC-Card system model study."
