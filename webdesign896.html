2012"This research applies methods from decision analysis to model latent therapeutic demand for common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) by integrating the variability in epidemiological data and treatment modalities. This approach is novel to forecast potential demand for the treatment of CVID where supply limitations have reduced the usefulness of sales-based forecasting methods. This approach can help manufacturers and healthcare agencies to ensure adequate treatment for patients with CVID."
