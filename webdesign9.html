2008"Financial service firms have invested heavily in analytics for credit risk management and for marketing. Complexity and the scale of candidate variables have also created an opportunity to search for better models and novel variables. This talk will examine how genetic algorithms have been successfully deployed for credit risk modeling and customer behavior modeling.
