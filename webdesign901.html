2006"We propose extending algebraic modeling languages so that solution algorithms that are based on iteratively modifying, manipulating, and solving a model are supported at a high abstraction level. We specifically focus on Stochastic Programming models and mathematical decomposition algorithms. We identify the necessary language constructs, and develop a design based on the open source modeling software APLEpy."
