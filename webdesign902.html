2006"In this paper we propose a simple, analytically tractable, stochastic model to incorporate local conformity, global diversity and punctuated equilibrium effect in a rigorous way. In doing so, the model provides a better understanding of the economics of herd behavior by characterazing precise meanings of the above three features. In addition, we discuss differences between the current stochastic model and some popular deterministic approximations."
