2013"In scaling-up Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) array manufacturing, the geometric quality of the array is characterized by the flatness of a nonlinear profile. In this work, we propose a run-to-run profile controller based on a state-space model and Kalman filter to improve the flatness of the CNTs array.  The performance of the proposed run-to-run control algorithm is studied and compared with existing controller via simulation studies."
