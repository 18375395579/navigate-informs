2008"We study a multi-commodity network design problem in which random disruptions are modeled using scenarios.  The model makes open/close decisions in the first stage and flow decisions in the second. We consider a bill-of-materials that specifies how input products are combined at each node. We propose a p-robust model which minimizes the nominal cost, while bounding the cost that can occur in each scenario. We also provide insights obtained from computational results."
