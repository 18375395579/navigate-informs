2013"Concentrating solar power with thermal energy storage (CSP-TES) can provide multiple benefits to the grid, but must be modeled to allow for the optimization of each component of the plant. We present a high fidelity model of CSP-TES, show the value of CSP-TES in a high renewable penetration scenario, and the effect of modeling simplifications including scheduled versus optimized dispatch and 24-hour ahead dispatch versus real time sub-hour dispatch, on the value of CSP-TES."
