2007"In this article, we examine the impact of mental health services on the functioning of the juvenile justice system and on crime in a community.  The authors have developed a complex, dynamic model of crime and delinquency in a hypothetical community and of the impact of adding a rehabilitative service to the juvenile justice system.  The authors have populated the key parameters of the model using data from the Fast Track, a large, longitudinal study of youth in four communities."
