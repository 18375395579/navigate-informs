2012"We develop a finite-horizon constrained Markov Decision Process to model diagnostic decisions after mammography where we maximize the total expected quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of a patient under resource constraints. Comparing to actual clinical practice, using optimal thresholds may result in 22% cost savings without sacrificing QALYs. Our modeling framework could be used for evaluating cost-effectiveness of diagnostic procedures."
