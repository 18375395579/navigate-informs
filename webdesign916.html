2006"Over the last five years, we have developed several new methods that use ideas from statistics, heuristic search, and mathematical programming for solving a variety of data mining problems. First, we describe our innovative methods for constructing classification trees in very large data sets. Second, we focus on discrete optimization models in data visualization. Third, we describe our work on formulating visualization models that are based on adjacency data using Sammon maps."
