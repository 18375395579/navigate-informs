2013"We develop an economic model of R&D investment at the portfolio (firm) level and show how the dynamics of the model can be used to infer R&D portfolio strategies based on the market value of the firm.  We use secondary data available through COMPUSTAT (cost of goods sold, R&D expenses, and market value of equity) to provide an example of how the data fit our model."
