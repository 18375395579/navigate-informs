2007"This talk will describe how Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)---a stochastic  model used widely in speech recognition systems---can be used to model noisy financial time series, such as stock market data.  A key difference between our approach and previous work in time series prediction is  that our approach is symbolic rather than numerical.  We show that  this approach yields relatively good  performance---both in terms of accuracy of prediction and for  algorithmic trading."
