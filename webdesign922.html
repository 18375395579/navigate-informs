2007"Xpress-MP features sophisticated, robust algorithms to quickly and accurately solve industry's most demanding Mixed Integer Programming Problems (MIPs) with millions of variables and constraints. Xpress Parallel-MIP harnesses the power of multi-core machines to give impressive performance improvements over a large set of models. In this work we investigate the impact of using parallel computing to reduce the solution times across different types of MIPs derived from real world applications."
