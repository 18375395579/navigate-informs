2012"The sampling decision is crucial to the success of any simulation experiment.  More samples imply better confidence and precision in the results, but require higher costs.  A sequential confidence interval procedure can be used to determine when to stop collecting samples.  We present a general framework for analyzing sequential rules and assessing their quality.  Solutions for managing the tradeoff between improved coverage and replications costs are provided."
