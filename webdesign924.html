2013"This paper argues that hands-on activities designed based on a prescriptive, step-by-step approach do not always achieve the expected learning outcomes.  Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle is proposed as a framework to design hands-on activities for virtual computer laboratories.  Empirical results are reported from two studies involving 169 students to test the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
