2008"Traditionally, Emergency Department (ED) does not operate based on appointments. While most low-acuity patients experience prolonged waiting time before being seen by a physician, mainly due to bed availability, they have some flexibility on their arrival time to the ED. Aiming at creating a balanced system and improving the patients¡¯ experience at the ED, a mathematical model combining historical trends and real-time information is established to schedule low-acuity patients at ED."
