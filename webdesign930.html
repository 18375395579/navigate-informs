2008"NASA's Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) Project systems analysis team performed an analysis of historical accident and incident data related to system component failure in FAR part 121 and  135 aviation.  Data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident database and the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) database were analyzed.  The results from this study will be used by IVHM leadership to evaluate the suite of safety related technologies whose research is supported by the project."
