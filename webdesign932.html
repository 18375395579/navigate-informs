2007"Stochastic decomposition (SD) incorporates sampling-based approximations within the L-shaped method. Current implementations of SD use stopping rules that are guided by bootstrapped ("in-sample") duality gap estimates. We develop several other stopping rules using "out-of-sample" estimates, and compare their performance on several test problems."
