2008"A web service often needs to host numerous users that store and access their online data. To provide services, the hardware is purchased and configured as nodes, each hosting a number of users. Built at different times, the nodes have distinct traffic processing capability and storage capacity. We present a modeling framework to allocate the user traffic and storage across the heterogeneous nodes. The framework enables the web services to achieve the maximal capacity and the best performance."
