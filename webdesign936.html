2012"Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of pattern classification to identify the brain activity with functional MRI (fMRI) technique. A pattern of multiple voxels distributed in the brain conveys discriminative information for cognitive recognition. In our work, we propose a framework to select a set of voxels by introducing a mutual information theory, which is applied to several linear classifiers. We show the experimental result on a multi-class cognition data set."
