2012"In a flexible AC transmission system, line reactance can be adjusted to improve a power grid's performance. We use a linearized DC flow model to approximate power grid. With line reactance being decision variables, a bilevel program is developed to find an optimal setting of reactance on power lines. We discuss solution approaches and  simulation results."
