2008"CHiPPS is the COIN-OR Open Parallel Search Framework, a framework for implementing parallel algorithms based on tree search. The current CHiPPS architecture consists of three layers: ALPS, BiCePS and BLIS.  In this talk, first we briefly introduce the main concepts of CHiPPS, then we use VRP/TSP as an example to show how to develop specific applicatoins based on CHiPPS."
