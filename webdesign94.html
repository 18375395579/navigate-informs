2008"Surgery accounts for a large portion of a hospital's total expenses and revenues. Therefore efficient use of operating rooms and other surgical resources is of great importance. We describe a discrete event simulation model to evaluate a number of scenarios involving the movement and expansion of an outpatient procedure center while attempting to answer some important questions regarding the new environment and how it may impact the operations of this area."
