2013"We exploit the implicit knowledge of influence-based connectivity and similarity encoded in network graph topology, and propose a novel algorithm that provides significant insight into community detection and influence analysis. Our approach creatively differentiates the influence ranking in a more meaningful and detailed manner. Experiments on both real-world and simulated networks show the superior performance of our algorithm for community detection."
