2012"We analyze the aggregate electricity consumption of many consumers, and  extract components for weather and natural illumination.  Least-squares  fits for Steadman apparent temperature and log-scale illumination  proceed independently for each hour of the day.  We use cubic polynomials  and spline surfaces, with FFT spectral analysis for residual  consumption.  We do a full comparison with simpler methods based on  exponential smoothing."
