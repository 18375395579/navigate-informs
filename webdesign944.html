2007"We develop queueing approximations of warehouse operations that can handle features such as planned inventory and limited storage capacity. We present an approximate model of a shared server that stores and retrieves material from a finite capacity rack. We discuss how this shared-server model can be used as a building block to develop comprehensive warehouse performance evaluation models."
