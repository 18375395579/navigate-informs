2008"This presentation will describe the Stochastic Energy Deployment System model under development by seven national laboratories for the Department of Energy.  This model simulates the U.S. energy system over the next 50 years with explicit consideration of the uncertainties inherent in technology development, fuel prices, market factors, and policy.  We will describe its development and immediate use for the evaluation of different technology portfolios of federal energy R&D efforts."
