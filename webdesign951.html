2012"We present a simulation-optimization model for finding near optimal strategies for prostate cancer screening, including decisions related to screening by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and treatment by radical prostatectomy. We discuss a customized implementation of COMPASS for solving our problem. Results from the COMPASS algorithm are compared to results from a previously published method based on a genetic algorithm. We present results, based on longitudinal data for a large North American population, to study the influence of personalized risk factors on individualized PSA-based screening policies."
