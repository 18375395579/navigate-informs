2006"Public decisionmaking is a challenging enterprise: practitioners and researchers must balance concerns of politics, policy, appropriate methods and fiscal constraints. In this presentation I review applications of OR/MS methods to problems in location of community corrections centers, fire stations and affordable housing, as well as reconfiguration of public school buildings and programs. My primary finding is that both qualitative and quantitative analytical methods are useful in assisting system change, especially in fiscally-constrained and politically contentious environments. Also, I find that "OR-like" thinking can be just as useful as explicit models and methods."
