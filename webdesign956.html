2008"We consider resource allocation for data transfer between the base station and users with finite data queues within a cell of a wireless telecommunication network. We derive an index policy that is stable and  attempts to minimize congestion. The index policy is based on a closed form index for every user derived using a policy improvement approach based on Markov Decision Processes. We compare its performance with existing policies through simulation."
