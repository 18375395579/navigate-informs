2013"New technologies has allowed for the recording of large data sets in machining, from forces to acoustic emissions. While the use of such data has been an active research area, the problem is usually considered a time-series analysis. What tends to be missing is the relationship between the time-series and the physical dimensions. This talk discusses the concept of performing a dimensional transformation of machining data into point cloud data for tool life prediction and process monitoring."
