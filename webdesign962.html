2008"Multi-objective optimization is combined with a novel auction mechanism in this research to evaluate and sell forest ecosystem services.  I will discuss the special features of this auction format and illustrate the bidding process using examples where the production of mature forest habitat, carbon sequestration and viewshed services are considered. I will present preliminary results about a pilot auctioning experiment."
