2012"Point of care testing (POCT) is becoming increasingly popular in US hospitals as a way to speed up testing processes, reduce patient length of stay (LOS), and improve patient satisfaction. This study uses propensity score matching (PSM) combine with dif-in-dif analysis to test the impact of POCT versus central lab testing on patient LOS, using two years of data collected at a US hospital. We find a significant reduction in LOS for POCT patients; the reduction is not uniform across all patients."
