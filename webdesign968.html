2013"We present a stochastic gas market model to capture the optimal long term contract quantity signed between producer and midstreamer. The model is based on an equilibrium approach where each player strives to optimize his long term risk adjusted payoff.    We assume the existence of a gas spot market where gas can be traded on the short term and the possibility to engage in LT contracts with different indexations. We discuss solution approaches and present first computational results."
