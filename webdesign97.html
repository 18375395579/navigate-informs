2007"We previously developed a heuristic subset clustering method that was  used to induce consideration sets, the set of products a customer  considers before a purchase.  In this work we use the resulting market  segmentation as a preprocessing step for choice prediction.  The  resulting simplified choice models identify easy-to-predict segments."
