2008"Many printers are connected to the Internet and send time-dependent data comprising sensor values and usage statistics to a data warehouse. When diagnosing faults within a machine, service engineers find it valuable to plot a time series of a particular variable and search a database for machines with similar behavior.  We present a system for search and retrieval that uses global similarity based on dynamic time warping and local similarity based on a modified Smith-Waterman metric."
