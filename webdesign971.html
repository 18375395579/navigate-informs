2006"The Federal Aviation Administration's NAS Strategy Simulator (NSS) investigates impacts of system and policy changes to the National Airspace System (NAS). The NSS models three key sectors: passengers & cargo, airlines, and the NAS. The model simulates in one-year increments calculating metrics for each sector, and includes eight user group categories. The model’s interfaces allow users to change input controls representing system or policy changes and to view future trends in real-time."
