2013"This study analyzes multi-server ticket queues with balking and reneging customers. We propose the introduction of learning time epochs, at which customers learn about their current state and make abandonment decisions, for modeling customer behavior during waits. We develop the framework for ticket queue analysis with general patience time distributions. Finally, we compare the system performance of our proposed model with that of traditional models using static patience times for customers."
