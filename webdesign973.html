2007"We present a Bayesian hierarchical model for integrating multi-resolution data. It includes a Gaussian process to model low-resolution data and a neighborhood linkage model to bridge the multi-resolution datasets. The Bayesian hierarchical framework utilizes information at all the resolution levels and predicts better at locations where only low-resolution measurements are available or no measurements are available. Improvements are demonstrated using metrology datasets of two resolutions."
