2006"We construct queueing and stochastic programming models to address the incident management problem.  Various types of incidents might happen depending on their severity.  The severity of incidents is assumed to affect system parameters such as the flow rate, the incident duration, or the number of response units required to clear the incident.  We present computational experiments to show the validity of these models."
