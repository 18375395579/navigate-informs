2012"We propose a dynamic framework which encompasses the main risks in balance sheets of banks. Our contributions include  solving a simple one-period model that describes the optimal bank policy under credit risk, and estimating and simulating the long-term stochastic processes for the balance sheet, taking into account the credit and interest rate cycles and short-term effects. Our results provide a basis for an optimization model to determine bank asset-liability management strategy endogenously."
