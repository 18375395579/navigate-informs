2007"A variety of complex systems arising in telecommunications,  manufacturing, the service industry and computer networks  can be modelled as stochastic networks networks.  Although an exact  analysis of these networks is often infeasible, tractable  approximations often shed valuable insight into their  behavior.  For multi-class, single-server queueing networks,  there exists a fairly well-developed framework, due in large part to  R. Williams and M. Bramson, for establishing so-called  "semimartingale reflected Brownian motion" approximations.  In this talk, I will present examples of simple queueing  networks arising in applications that fall outside this  framework and are, instead, approximated by different classes  of processs that are interesting in their own right.  The talk is based on research done in collaboration with  Weining Kang, Haya Kaspi and Marty Reiman."
