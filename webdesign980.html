2013"Demand for outpatient chemotherapy delivery is rising, resulting in high patient volumes at infusion centers. To reduce patient waiting times and operating hours, we developed a stochastic programming model and easy to implement heuristics to generate patient appointment times at an infusion center. Our models explicitly consider the uncertainty of patient infusion times. We also show a detailed discrete event simulation model to evaluate the performance of the new patient appointment schedules."
