2006"One view of voting/rank aggregation is the following. There exists a ``correct'' outcome (winner/ranking), and each voter's vote corresponds to a noisy perception of this correct outcome. If we are given the noise model, then for any vector of votes, we can compute the maximum likelihood estimate of the correct outcome. We study the following question: For which common voting rules does there exist a noise model such that the rule is the maximum likelihood estimator for that noise model?"
