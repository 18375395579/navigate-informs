2007"In this work we consider the Area Restriction Modeland study the  effects of using different adjacency definitions on  the optimal objective value and the fragmentation of the optimal  solution. We consider several definitions of adjacency based on  distance and length of the intersection between forest stands and we  also study the effect of simultaneously using more than one adjacency  definition. Results presented are based on several real forest data  sets available in the FMOS repository."
