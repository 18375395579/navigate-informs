2013"With many non-stationary queueing models, we must settle for only estimating their moment behavior since obtaining other information is very difficult to obtain or intractable. To estimate the moments, we expand the queueing process via Laguerre polynomials and use a truncated expansion to derive approximate expectations terms.  We show that three or four terms of the Laguerre polynomial sequence is enough to estimate cumulant moments such as the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis."
