2006"In this paper we investigate the nature of the effect of reserve prices on the price of internet auctions with a semi-parametric model where a) all continuous covariates that affect the auction outcome are allowed to enter non-parametrically b) number of bidders is allowed to be endogenous, and c) the response variable can be censored. We apply the proposed model to data on five identical items from eBay."
