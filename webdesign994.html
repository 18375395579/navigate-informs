2008"The S&OP process seeks to find a plan that optimizes business performance yet is also achievable.      In practice, achievability is a blend of hard constraints and acceptable risks against soft constraints. In practice, the S&OP is a collaborative process where functional owners of each constraint and objective must reach an optimal plan through consensus.    We will present a web services based framework that uses optimization and analytics to support this collaborative process."
