2007"Statistical research on disease outbreak detection using syndromic data has focused on modeling background behavior and anomaly detection. Such data contain known patterns and thus algorithms often comprise of initial preprocessing before monitoring the resulting residuals using SPC. Most studies combine one preprocessing technique and one control chart. Our approach combines algorithms via LP: We propose a method for combining preprocessing algorithms and one for combining control charts."
