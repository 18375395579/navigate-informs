2012"We develop a new methodology to predict an extreme load on a wind turbine by employing high-fidelity simulation. Due to a small probability of extreme events, crude Monte Carlo simulation requires extensive runs, which is computationally prohibitive.   We devise an efficient sampling method to guide the simulation to generate the extreme events more frequently with minimal efforts.  The proposed method is applied to an aerodynamic simulation."
