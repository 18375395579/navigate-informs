2012"We compare the costs of using the Joint Precision Airdrop System with the C-5M aircraft versus the C-17 platform currently used.  Our research question is that the C-5M’s greater range and payload capacity renders it a more cost-effective overall delivery platform.  To test this hypothesis, we created a spreadsheet-based model that combines planning factors and optimization to estimate the cost associated with a wide range of payloads and mission distances."
